      <p>Jones Memorial Library is a specialized genealogy and history library. Our collections
        share the story of Lynchburg and Central Virginia through primary and secondary sources,
        including books and journals, manuscripts, maps, obituaries, and much more. In most cases,
        materials accepted and retained are limited to those with specific reference to the
        Lynchburg, Virginia region and people who have lived in the area. Special collections and
        materials include the Lynchburg Architectural Archives, the Lynchburg Families archive, the
        Civil War &amp; the Lost Cause, Lynchburg industrial and organizational history, and materials
        that document the physical area at a particular point in time (i.e., maps, surveys, and
        photographs).</p>
      <p>Although this record does not contain a list of all ssubject terms and keywords, this list
