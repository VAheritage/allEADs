</head>
<p>James Cosby Montgomery, the son of John G. Montgomery and Etha Grogan Montgomery, was born in Emory, Virginia on 29 January 1909.  He attended schools in Saltville and Glade Spring; he also attended Emory and Henry College before transferring to University of Michigan and ultimate graduation at Radford University with a degree in education.  Montgomery also conducted graduate work at the University of Virginia, North Carolina State College, and the University of Michigan.  He taught schools in Washington County and Wythe County and also served as principal of Ivanhoe High School before assuming a position as visiting teacher for the Wythe County school system.  As such, Montgomery counseled students and their families who withdrew from school for health, economic, and psychological reasons.
</p>
<p>James Cosby Montgomery married Rubye Rice, daughter of Hugh P. and Lillie Rice, on 25 December 1939 at the family home in Mendota, Virginia.  Rice taught school at Valley Institute high School when she met Montgomery who was teaching near Saltville.  They later moved to Wytheville in 1945.  Rubye Rice Montgomery taught school at Wytheville Elementary School until her retirement.</p>
<p>Their only child, John Rice Montgomery, was born on 1 June 1944.  He attended school in Wythe County, graduating from George Wythe High School in 1962 as valedictorian.  He attended the University of Michigan where he received a degree in English in 1966.  He then taught English at Jefferson High School, Addison High School, and Fleming High School in Roanoke, Virginia.  In 1974 Montgomery became administrator in the Roanoke City Schools and later served as assistant superintendent for Salem City from 1980 to 1986.  He then worked as headmaster for the Community School on the Hollins College campus.  In 1987 he assumed the executive directorship of Voice of the Blue Ridge, a non-profit group for the blind and visually impaired.</p>
<p>James Cosby Montgomery died on 27 June 1964 after a two year illness from heart problems.  Rubye Rice Montgomery died on 1 July 1999 in Roanoke while John Rice Montgomery died on 23 August 2002,also in Roanoke, Virginia.
