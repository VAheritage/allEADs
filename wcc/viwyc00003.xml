      <head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
      <p>A resident of Cook County, Tennessee, George Stuart (1789-1862) had several children by his first wife including James H. Stuart, Mary Stuart Benham, David Stuart, John H. Stuart, and George Stuart Jr. On 14
February 1832 he married Margaret McCutcheon Hay Ward (1796-1864), the wealthy widow of James Ward (1781-1823) and daughter of prosperous Evansham merchant William Hay (1763-1839). Margaret Stuart inherited
valuable estates in land, slaves, and money from her father and her first husband; her second husband George Stuart purchased interest in the estates both of James Ward and William Hay. George traveled frequently
to Nashville, Tennessee in order to collect debts and conduct legal transactions pertaining to these estates. In 1853, the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company appointed him to their Board of Directors;
Subsequently, he journeyed to Lynchburg, Virginia frequently on railroad business.
</p>
      <p>The Stuarts raised five children including Jane Stuart (1832-1868), James Ward Stuart (1835-1920), Margaret Stuart (1837-1856), William Stuart (1839-1888), and Laura Stuart Thomas (1841-1870). Stuart enjoyed
prosperity until his death in 1862. The 1850 census shows him with an estate worth $15,000 and the 1860 census show his assets worth $25,000 in real estate and $75,000 in personal property.
</p>
      <p>James Ward Stuart attended law school at the University of Virginia but did not graduate. He worked instead a merchant and farmer, accumulating modest wealth. The 1860 census shows him living with his father
and worth $800 in real estate and $6,000 in personal property. Stuart joined Co. A. of the 13th Va. Battalion of Light Artillery, participating in campaigns in East Tennessee, Southwest Virginia, and Petersburg.
Returning to Wythe County after the war, he married Minerva Margaret Buchanan with whom he had four children. After Minerva's death, he married her sister Martha Caroline Buchanan in 1879; they had four children.
Stuart was a general store merchant in the Black Lick district. In 1870, W. C. Aumann and W. A. Stuart sold him their store on the Black Lick Turnpike. He died in 1920 at Wilmore, Kentucky and is buried in
Nicholasville, Kentucky.
</p>
      <p>William Stuart worked as a clerk before and after the Civil War. He joined Co. A of the 4th Va. Infantry Regiment in April 1861 as a private and advanced to ordnance sergeant in November 1863. Serving with the
famed Stonewall Brigade, he participated in major battles of the Civil War including the Valley Campaign, Seven Days Campaign, 2nd Bull Run, Antietam, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, the Wilderness, and
Spotsylvania. Unfortunately his letters during these battles are not extant. However, he does describe actions of the 4th Va. Infantry Regiment at Fisher's Hill, Cedar Creek, and the Petersburg Campaign in letters
in this collection. After the war, Stuart married Nannie Hancock and lived in the Black Lick district of Wythe County with his father-in-law L. D. Hancock. The 1870 census lists him with $5,000 in real estate and
$2,000 in personal property. The 1880 census lists him as working as an engineer. No information has been found regarding children born to Nannie and William Stuart. He died in 1888 and is buried in East End
cemetery in Wytheville, Virginia.
</p>
      <p>Laura Stuart lived with her father, mother, and sister Jane in Wytheville during the Civil War. She married Charles Benton Thomas on 15 March 1870 in Wytheville, Virginia in a Presbyterian ceremony conducted by
Rev. James T. Leftwich. Thomas, son of wealthy Smyth County entrepreneur Abijah Thomas, graduated from Emory and Henry College in 1861. Throughout the Civil War he managed his father's tannery and iron works (known
as Sparkling Mountain Tannery and Onondaga Tannery and the Marion Magnetic Furnace). Until January 1866, she remained at the family home in Wytheville while her husband supervised the construction on their house
near Onondaga Tannery near Marion, Virginia. The couple lived in Marion until November 1867 when Charles Benton Thomas assumed management of his father's Mount Vernon Cotton Factory.
</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the cotton factory proved a liability and the Thomas family moved to Norfolk, Virginia in April 1869. The family returned to Wytheville two months later but Charles Benton Thomas continued
working for the George J. Rogers Cotton Broker Purchasing Agency in Norfolk. As a cotton agent, he traveled excessively and left Laura and his son Edward in Wytheville.
</p>
      <p>Laura Stuart Thomas and Charles Benton Thomas had two children, George Stuart (1866-1869) and Edward A. (1868-1921). Both sons are buried in St. John's Lutheran Church cemetery beside their mother who died in
October 1870 of consumption.
</p>
      <p>After the death of Laura, Thomas studied law at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, graduating with his degree in 1872. He practiced both in Wytheville and Rural Retreat. On 24 July 1878,
Thomas married Elizabeth Pierce Crockett and settled near his brother-in-law Willliam Stuart in the northern Black Lick district (known as District III in the 1880 census). Elizabeth (known as Lizzie) and Charles
Benton Thomas raised seven children including Elizabeth Thomas Hanson, William Crockett Thomas, Laura Thomas Hickok, Charles Benton Thomas Jr., Robert P. Thomas, Charles Mitchell Thomas, and David Graham Thomas.
</p>
      <p>Thomas remained a devoted member of the Presbyterian Church throughout his life, serving as an elder and clerk of the Session. He attended Royal Oak Presbyterian Church as a youth and then joined Wytheville
Presbyterian Church where he worshipped until his death on 15 February 1923.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The Stuart Family Papers chronicle the life of wealthy Wythe County farmer George Stuart, his wife Margaret McCutcheon Hay Ward Stuart, and their children James Ward Stuart, William Stuart, Laura Stuart, and
Jane Stuart. The collection consists of antebellum and Civil War correspondence between family members and friends. Also included are several letters to Laura Stuart from her fiancÃ© and husband Charles
Benton Thomas of Smyth County, Virginia. Wartime letters from William Stuart (Co. A, 4th Virginia Infantry Regiment) and James Ward Stuart (Co. A, Otey Battery, 13th Virginia Battalion of Light Artillery) to Laura
and Jane Stuart provide researchers information on the life of Confederate soldiers during the East Tennessee campaign, battle of Fisher's Hill, Cedar Creek, and the Petersburg siege. Fellow soldiers of her
brother James Ward Stuart including William A. Slaymaker, Henry C. Slaymaker, and Waldo W. Walton also wrote Laura Stuart.
