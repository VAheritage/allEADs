<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Ruth Ella Poston, born Mary Catherine Carpenter, was born 3 March 1909 to Marian Greenhill Carpenter and John Carpenter of Scioto County, Ohio.  She was placed into the custody of George S. Poston and Oma Neal Armbrister Poston of Wytheville Virginia on 4 October 1911.  George Poston, born 13 August 1873, was a repair machinist.  Ruth Ella Poston was formally adopted in 1918 and an adoption order changing her name (from Mary Catherine Carpenter) was filed on 11 February 1920; at that time the Poston family resided in Scioto County, Ohio.
</p>
<p>Oma Poston died on 20 May 1925 in Portsmouth, Ohio from heart dropsy and was buried in East End Cemetery, Wytheville, Virginia.  George Poston filed and received guardianship of Ruth on 15 September 1926.  Evidently this was done to facilitate a lawsuit for partition of real estate.</p>
<p>George Poston is buried in East End Cemetery, the date of death is unknown.  Ruth Poston married Lawrence Pattison of Portsmouth, Ohio and lived in Wytheville, Virginia.  She had two daughters, Kathleen Poston Jackson and Betty Poston Polakoff.  Ruth Poston Pattison died 23 June 1981 in Wytheville, Virginia.  She is buried in East End Cemetery.</p>
