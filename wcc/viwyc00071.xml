<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>John Martin Phipps, born 26 June 1865, was the son of Joseph A. Phipps and Cynthia Bourne Phipps of Bridle Creek, Grayson County, Virginia.  He attended King College and the Medical College of Virginia from which he graduated in 1887.  On 8 April 1887 he received his license to practice medicine, establishing a practice in Independence initially before moving to Rural Retreat, Virginia.
</p>
<p>Phipps married Cora Miller, daughter of Rev. Charles K. Miller and Mattie Young Miller, on 28 November 1892.  A native of Rural Retreat, Cora Miller Phipps graduated from Martha Washington College in 1885.  The Phipps raised three children, Ruth Varnelle Phipps (1893-1972), John Neal Phipps (1900-1962), and Lois M. Phipps (1907-1959).  The family attended Rural Retreat Methodist Church; Dr. Phipps served the church as a trustee for many years.  He also had a farm, raising cabbages and apples among other crops.</p>
<p>Dr. Phipps died 17 June 1911 from a cerebral hemorrhage.  Cora Miller Phipps spent the next several years raising her two children and settling financial issues such as selling stock acquired by her husband.  She also continued to manage the family farm and livestock.  She died on 10 February 1934 and is buried with her husband and children in Mountain View Cemetery in Rural Retreat, Virginia.</p>
