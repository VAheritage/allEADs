<p>Rev. Thomas H. Lacy (1848-1928, son of Richmond Terrell Lacy and Ellen Green Lane, was born in New Kent County, Virginia. Lacy graduated from Virginia Theological Seminary in 1872 and served in Episcopal parishes in Virginia and West Virginia.  He married Mary Baldwin Goodwin (1844-1903) in September 1873 at St. John's Episcopal Church in Wytheville, Virginia.  She was the daughter of Rev. Frederick Deane Goodwin.  The couple had four daughters included Mary Goodwin Lacy (1875-1962, Ellen Lane Lacy (1876-1960), Frances Eppes Lacy (1879-1963), and Ethel Archer Lewis Lacy (1887-1971).
