</head>
      <p>Born on 10 June 1765 at Kircheim on the Tech, in the Dukedom of Wurtemberg, Germany, John Stanger was the son of innkeeper Johannes Stanger and Eva Catharina Kunckelen Stanger.  He attended Tubingen University, studying theology.  He immigrated to America in 1787, arriving in October in Charleston, South Carolina.  He pastored a congregation in Rowan County, North Carolina from December 1787 to the spring of 1790.  Stanger was ordained in North Carolina in October 1791 at the first semi-annual Assembly of Lutherans in the region.  From Rowan County he moved to Wythe County in 1790 and founded Zion Lutheran Church on Cripple Creek.
</p>
      <p>Zion Lutheran Church was dedicated in 1794 and shared by the Lutheran congregation of John Stanger and the German Reformed congregation of Rev. Daniel Repass.  Stanger served Zion Lutheran Church from 1791 to 1824; he also occasionally conducted services for churches for Lutherans on Back Creek, Price's Fork, Sinking Creek, and Peak Creek in Montgomery County and Pulaski COunty as well as Elk Creek in Grayson County.</p>
      <p>Aside from his spiritual duties, Stanger served his adopted county of Wythe and state of Virginia as a justice of the peace, school commissioner, commissioner of the revenue, and delegate to the General Assembly (1832-1840).  He also taught school in the early 1790s and was a trustee for Wythe Academy.</p>
      <p>Stanger married Magdalena Wampler (1772-1846) on 25 December 1791.  The couple had nine children including Salome (Sally) Stanger Spangler (b. 1792)(married Jacob Spangler); Magdalena (Polly) Stanger Earhart (b. 1794) (married John Earhart); Theresia Stanger Brown Miller (1797-1879) (married 1) Daniel Brown 2) Michael Miller); John Stanger Jr. (1799-1884)(married Caty  Brownlow); Henry (1802-1802); Sophia Stanger Nye (1805-1866) (married John Price Nye); Sylvester Stanger (1807-1854) (married 1) Polly Miller 2) Mary Cowden); Jacob Stanger (b. 1810)(married Hannah Boyd); and Catherine (1813-1814).  John Stanger died on 14 October and is buried in the Zion Church Cemetery in Wythe County, Virginia.</p>

          <p>This journal was kept by Rev. John Stanger to document his pastoral services in Montgomery County and Wythe COunty between 1798 and 1827.  He recorded marriages in North Carolina and Virginia, deaths, and notes on sermons and services performed at his congregations at Cripple Creek, Elk Creek, Peak Creek, Reed Creek, and Sinking Creek.  The journal also contains miscellaneous entries including debts, a prescription, record of horse shoeing, list of children attending his school, and horse boarding.  Most of the entries are in German.  At the beginning of the journal is an account of a transatlantic journey made by an anonymous traveler.  
</p>
          <p>Translations of the transatlantic journey account by Erika Heimbruch as well as Mary B. Kegley's detailed notes, translations, and lists of marriages and deaths recorded in the journal are available with the printed inventory in the Kegley Library.</p>
          <p>The W. J. Barrow Restoration Shop conserved the journal in the 1970s.</p>
