      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>John B. Hurt was born 4 March 1904 in Fairmont, West Virginia, the son of John David P. Hurt and Edith Shaffer.  The family moved to Wytheville where Hurt attended area schools, and developed an intense passion for languages especially Japanese.  A former missionary to Japan introduced him to the language that became his life's work.
</p>
      <p>Hurt studied at the College of William and Mary and then transferred to Roanoke College.  At this Lutheran liberal arts school Hurt further honed his linguistic skill by rooming with a Japanese roommate, Masao Maura, among other foreign students.  He also befriended Chitose Koshi, who later became a Lutheran minister in Japan.  He later studied at the University of Virginia.  It was not until 1952, however. that he received a Bachelors of Arts from the University of Maryland. </p>
      <p>He met and married Ana Dritelle, a cellist, while in France.  The marriage was later annulled .  After the death of his second wife, Myrtle Deteirre around 1945, Ana Dritelle and Hurt remarried.</p>
      <p>Hurt began his linguistic and cryptologic career in 1930 as a cryptanalyst aide in the Signal Intelligence Service, a predecessor to the National Security Agency.  He and his co-workers, including Frank Rowlett, intercepted and attempted to decode live international radio intelligence codes.  Hurt eventually became head of the linguistic division and retired in 1963.</p>
      <p>He and his wife Ana Dritelle Hurt (remarried ca. 1949) settled in New York where he died on 8 August 1966.
