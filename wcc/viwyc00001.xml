      <abstract label="Abstract">The Frank Hanson Terry Papers
         provide researchers a glimpse into the personal and
         professional life of a Wythe County newspaperman. The
         collection contains correspondence and manuscripts relating to
         newspaper articles as well as family life. An important focus
         of the collection are three letters sent to Terry circa
         1915-1917 from his cousin Edith Bolling Galt
         Wilson.</abstract>

      <p>Son of C.S.A. Brigadier-General William Robinson Terry and
         Emily Burton Wigginton Terry,Frank Hanson Terry was born on 21
         September 1860 in Wytheville. He attended Virginia Polytechnic
         Institute but did not graduate. Instead, he entered the
         newspaper business in February 1884 when he, with Robert Enoch
         Withers, purchased the Wytheville Dispatch from William St.
         Clair. In June 1885 Terry assumed full control of the paper
         when Withers embarked to serve as U. S. consul to Hong Kong.
         Concurrently, Terry published and edited the quarterly
         publication of Kappa Sigma fraternity from 1885 to 1887. Terry
         married Norma Lee Green (1865-1956) at St. John's Episcopal
         Church on 14 April 1887. Frank and Norma Terry had six sons
         and two daughters. One son, William, died in infancy.
         Surviving sons included Joel Green Terry (1887-1963), William
         Withers Terry (1889-1939), Arthur Palfrey Terry (1893-1955),
         Heartwhel Terry (1897-1952) and Raymond Wiggonton Terry
         (1900-1973). One daughter Eleanor (1891-1980) married John
         James Noel while another, Norma Lee (1896-1981), married John
         R. Manley. Terry also sold life and fire insurance and also
         was active in local government. He served as a member of
         Wytheville Town Council from 1899 to 1900 and 1902 to 1906. he
         also was Treasurer of the Town of Wytheville. Terry died on 10
         November 1937 and is buried beside his wife in East End
         Cemetery in Wytheville, Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Series I contains both professional and personal
         correspondence dating form 1902 to 1961. Professional
         correspondence includes letters received from John Sargeant
         Wise, J. Stuart Crockett, and Curtis Carroll Davis regarding
         the 1885 duel between Wise and John Stuart Crockett at Bangs,
         Montgomery County, Virginia. Wise and J. Stuart Crockett,
         cousin of duelist John Stuart Crockett, gave Terry their
         version of one of the last duels fought in Virginia. In 1961,
         author Curtis Carroll Davis queried Terry's daughter-in-law,
         Laura Payne Terry, about the duel for an article appearing in
         Virginia Cavalcade (Vol. IX, no. 2, 1961). Letters from Edith
         Bolling Galt Wilson and her sister Bertha Bolling complete
         this series. In an 6 October 1915 letter, Edith Galt announced
         her engagement to President Woodrow Wilson. Subsequent letters
         from both women concern Frank Terry's request for a position
         in Wilson's administration. Frank Terry and the Bolling
         sisters shared ancestry through Benjamin (1778-1863) and
         Harriet Scott Wigginton (1791-1834). Series II, Manuscripts
         ([1888]- 1904, undated, contain drafts of articles Terry wrote
         perhaps for his newspaper the Wytheville Dispatch. Topics
         include the murder of Peter Harrell by Wayman Sutton in 1887,
         the murder of William Spiller by James A. Graham in 1855,
         Wythe Lead and Zinc Company, Wythe County Courthouse bell, the
         early history of Wythe County as well as a pair of child's
         shoes made form the uniform of C. S. A. Brig.- Gen. William
         Robinson Terry. Ephemera on Wytheville and the Wythe County
         sesquicentennial celebration comprise the bulk of Series III,
         Miscellaneous (1887-1940, undated). Wytheville items include a
         1900 directory, 1934 parking ordinances, and an 1887
         "Illustrated Prospectus." A brochure by Frederick Bittle
         Kegley, an exhibit guide, and a program for the historical
         pageant "Wings of Time" focus on Wythe County's
         sesquicentennial (1790-1940) celebration. Also included in
         this series is a 1912 petition by Wytheville taxpayers to
         re-elect Frank Hanson Terry as Treasurer as well as a 1938 map
         by Elizabeth W. Wilkins showing "Historic, Scenic, and
         Industrial Southwestern Virginia." Postcards of Wytheville at
         night and U. S. Route 11 on Draper Mountain complete this
         series.</p>
