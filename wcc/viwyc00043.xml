</head>
<p>Peter Cline Honaker, son of early settlers Abraham Honaker and Sarah Ann Cline Honaker, was born on 10 October 1812.  He established his home in Rocky Gap, Bland County, and married Mary Ann Haven Davidson in North Carolina.  Honaker died on 21 January 1887 in Rocky Gap and is buried in the Tuggle-Honaker Cemetery there.  He and his wife raised nine children.
</p>
<p>One of those offspring was John Robert Honaker (usually known as J. R. Honaker) who was born on 22 November 1858.  He married Mary Jane Scott (1861-1951), daughter of Andrew Porter Scott and Ann Jane Newland, on 25 February 1885.  They had seven children including Ada Ann Honaker (m.
