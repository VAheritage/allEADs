<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>James Fulcher (14 April 1810-18 February 1882) was a blacksmith and farmer in Abingdon, Washington County, Virginia.  He probably was a relative of Thomas Fulcher (1797-1829) and Sarah Fulcher of Wythe County, Virginia, judging from a chancery court case in Series II.  James married Sarah Jones on 24 June 1830 in Washington County.  According to census records (1850-1870) and marriage records, the children of James and Sarah included:
</p>
<p>Nancy Martin Dickerson Fulcher, born ca. 1835 and married Leander Jackson Keller 2 August 1859.  She died ca. 1867 and was buried in Sinking Spring Cemetery, Abingdon, Virginia.</p>
<p>Samuel Fulcher, born ca. 1838, served in Co. D, 1st Virginia Cavalry Regiment and died in 1862.</p>
<p>Eliza Fulcher, born ca. 1840-1841, married Francis M. Medley on 6 November 1866.</p>
<p>James Fulcher, born 1844, served in Co. D, 1st Virginia Cavalry Regiment and was elected lieutenant in April 1862.  He was living in Knoxville, Tennessee ca. 1908.</p>
<p>George Hopkins Fulcher was born in 1848.</p>
<p>William O. Fulcher was born 1850.</p>
<p>Virginia Fulcher was born 1853 and married Fayett M. Bryant on 22 September 1870.</p>
<p>According to WPA Papers, James Fulcher worked as a blacksmith in Abingdon and was an "honest and industrious man."  Unfortunately he suffered financial ruin and filed for bankruptcy probably during the 1850s.  On the 1850 census he listed a worth of $2,000.  By 1860 he had changed professions and recouped his losses; the 1860 census lists him as a farmer worth $10,000 in real estate and $2,300 in personal property.</p>
<p>Sarah (Sally) Jones Fulcher died between 1860 and 1867, a January 1860 letter from her son Samuel mentions her illness.  James remarried on 26 September 1867 to Nancy Red and continued farming in Abingdon.  James and Nancy had two daughters, Molly A. Fulcher and Margaret R. Fulcher.</p>
<p>Fulcher continued farming in his later years.  According to the 1870 census he possessed $3,000 in real estate and $800 in personal property.  According to WPA Papers, James Fulcher died on 18 February 1882 and is buried in the Sinking Springs Cemetery in Abingdon, Virginia.  Nancy Reid Fulcher died 14 January 1903 and is buried in Sinking Springs.</p>
