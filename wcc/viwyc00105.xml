      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>Items in the Whitman Family Papers primarily document the family history of Carrie Heuser Whitman.  Her maternal great-grandfather was Jacob Ruff, a hatter who lived in Lexington, Virginia.  Ruff and his wife, Martha Wallace Ruff, had five daughters; one daughter, Sarah Jane Ruff, married Massillon Sehorn in 1842.
</p>
      <p>Massillon Sehorn, a deputy sheriff of Rockbridge County, was descended from early Shenandoah Valley settler Nicholas Sehorn.  Massillon and Sarah Jane Ruff had one daughter, Sarah Jane Lapsley Sehorn, born 9 April 1843.  A few weeks after her daughter's birth, Sarah Jane Ruff Sehorn died 29 April 1843.</p>
      <p>Sarah Jane Sehorn, nicknamed Jennie, lived with her aunt, Mrs. Henry Imboden, after her father died in 1844.  She attended a Presbyterian Sunday School class taught by Anna Morrison Jackson, wife of Thomas Jonathan <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Stonewall</title> Jackson.  She moved to Wytheville before the Civil War to live with her uncle, Marion Sehorn, a prominent hatter.</p>
      <p>In 1865, Sarah Jane Sehorn married local merchant, Guido Alexander Heuser.  Heuser, a native of Rodenberg, Germany and Sarah had four children.  Their daughter, Caroline Friderike Heuser married John Alexander Whitman in 1899.</p>
      <p>John Alexander Whitman edited the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Southwest Virginia Enterprise</title> from 1902 to 1944.  Caroline <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Carrie</title> and John Whitman had three children.  One daughter, Dora Heuser Whitman, died in infancy in 1914 while another daughter, Marian Clay Whitman, married Dr. Rush Lambert.  Their youngest child, Genevieve Sehorn Whitman, married Henry Peck Simmerman.  Carrie Whitman died 20 September 1951 and is buried near her husband in East End Cemetery in Wytheville, Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The Whitman Family Papers are arranged in six series.  Series I, Correspondence (1835-1951) includes letters relating to Sarah Jane Ruff Sehorn of Lexington, Virginia from 1835 to 1842.  As especially poignant letter written by her grieving husband describes her death in April 1843.  Other letters recount everyday life of young women in Lexington and Staunton, Virginia and Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
      <p>Correspondence on genealogical research conducted by Caroline Heuser Whitman and John Alexander Whitman is also featured in this series.  Both corresponded widely with relatives and genealogists concerning the Wallace family, Whitman family, Montgomery family, Anderson family, Gay family, Hale family, Sehorn family, and Burwell family.  Addendum items added to the correspondence series include letters to and from John Alexander Whitman regarding Sons of the American Revolution, installation of a hot water furnace, and the Thomas family.</p>
