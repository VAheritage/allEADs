</head>
      <p>James Drayton Painter, the son of land baron Abraham Painter (1804-1886) and Emily Ewing Painter (1822-1889), 
was born on 26 November 1844.  He grew up in the Cripple Creek and Ivanhoe areas of Wythe County, Virginia.  The Painter
family owned extensive property in this area of the county and in 1872 purchased the Brown Hill Furnace.  They sold the furnace
in 1880 to the Lobdell Car Wheel Company.
</p>
      <p>Painter enlisted in Co. D (known as the Wythe Minute Men) of the 45th Virginia Infantry Regiment, C. S. A&gt; on 27 February
1862 at Red Sulphur Springs.  Captured by Federal forces at the Battle of Piedmont on 5 June 1864, he was incarcerated in Camp Morgan
in Indianapolis, Indiana.  With thousands of other Confederate soldiers, in March 1865 he was exchanged and returned home to Virginia.</p>
      <p>He married Martha Lou Hatcher (born on 24 August 1849) on 28 October 1869; their daughter, Myra Parks Painter, was born in November 1870.  Painter owned and managed J. D. Painter &amp; Brothers General Mercantile Store and also was a banker.  He was an active member of the Methodist Church in Ivanhoe</p>
      <p>Myra Painter married lawyer and judge Henry Massillon Heuser and moved to Wytheville, Virginia.  Martha Lou Hatcher Painter died on 27 May 1900 and is buried in Forest United Methodist Church cemetery.  James Drayton Painter died at the home of his daughter and son-in-law in Wytheville on 13 March 1932 and was buried beside his wife.</p>
