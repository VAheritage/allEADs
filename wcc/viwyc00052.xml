<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The son of David Cloyd Kent (1833-1902) and Judith Elizabeth Ligon Kent(1831-1900), James Ligon Kent was born on 27 August 1867 in Pulaski County, Virginia.  Kent grew up on a large cattle farm as his father was an agricultural entrepreneur.  David Cloyd Kent, a founder of the Pulaski County Agricultural and Mechanical Association, actively competed in agricultural fairs and shows.  He also developed and patented a hay carrier.  Judith Ligon Kent was the daughter of James Ligon and Judith Bentley Ligon of Powhatan County, Virginia.
</p>
<p>James Ligon Kent attended Hampden Sydney College from 1884 to 1887 an graduated from medical school at The University of Virginia.  He worked at Bellevue Hospital, Manhattan Eye and ear Hospital, and the New York Polyclinic Hospital and College at varying periods between 1897 and 1903.  He served as physician for the Bertha Mineral Company in Pulaski until 1896.  In 1898, Kent set up his medical practice at 811 Church Street in Lynchburg, Virginia.</p>
<p>James Ligon Kent married Annie Donoho Bayliss (1876-1959) on 7 June 1898.  Originally from Memphis and St. Louis, Bayliss garnered acclaim for her paintings and photography.  She studied at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D. C. and exhibited her art work nationally including the 1892 World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois.  James and Annie Kent had four children.  Their first child, born 27 June 1902, lived only two days.  They had twins born on 5 April 1908; only David Cloyd Kent survived.  Finally a daughter, Margaret Bayliss Kent, was born on 9 June 1914.</p>
<p>The Kents returned to Pulaski County in 1913 to live on Triple Brook Stock Farm, an inherited property.  Here James Ligon Kent retired from medicine and engaged in his lifelong passion of gentleman farming and historical studies.  He also invested time and money in the coal mining business with little success.  With his nephew D. Gray Langhorne, Kent struggled to launch the D. Gray Langhorne Coal Company into prosperity.  The competition from northern companies forced Langhorne and Kent to sell rights to the Pulaski coal lands to various companies including the Virginia Anthracite Coal Corporation, the Empire Corporation, and the repossession of the coal mines in 1930.  they chartered the Anthracite Coal and Briquetting Company in September 1931.  Although D. Gray Langhorne's strove to compete with Pennsylvania mines, the company folded and the mines closed in December 1938.
</p>
<p>Kent then spent most of his time researching and writing about Pulaski County history and genealogy.  He wrote a series of articles on Pulaski County history for <title render="italic">The Southwest Times</title> in 1938 and 1939 as well as regularly writing letters to the editor on historical topics.  Kent also corresponded with genealogists primarily regarding the Ligon and Kent families.</p>
<p>James Ligon Kent died in a Wytheville nursing home in 1950.</p>
<p>His son, David Cloyd Kent, attended Hampton-Sydney College and the Clarence White School of Photography in New York City.  He returned to Pulaski in 1929 and opened a studio, specializing in commercial and portrait photography.  He also worked under contract with Hercules Company photographing various aspects of the defense works in the Pulaski and Dublin areas.</p>
<p>During World War II, David served as a sergeant in the Photo Mail Section of the Army at the Pentagon.  He married Sally Combs on 28 February 1944 at the Little Church Around the Corner in New York City.  He returned to Pulaski and resumed his successful photography career.  Kent died on 12 January 1996.  Margo Kent, a photographer, lives in Staunton, Virginia.</p>
