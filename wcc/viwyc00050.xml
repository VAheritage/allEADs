</head>
      <p>Born on 7 July 1877, Frederick Bittle Kegley received A. B. and A. M. degrees from Roanoke College.  He taught during the 1901-1902 school year at Wytheville High School.  He later worked as an instructor of English and history at Roanoke College from 1902 to 1905.  Kegley studied political and social science under Professor E. P. Cheney at the university of Pennsylvania from 1905 to 1906.  When his father died, he returned home to manage the family farm and to teach at Wytheville High School.  In 1910 Kegley became an agricultural agent, working in Washington and Wythe counties.
</p>
      <p>Kegley married Frances Pinckney Withers in 1914.  Frances Kegley attended Stonewall Jackson College in Abingdon, Virginia as well as Randolph Macon College in Lynchburg, Virginia.  She was active in Wythe County civic life as a member of the Home Demonstration Club, Daughters of the American Revolution, and other organizations.</p>
      <p>Besides farming and teaching, Frederick B. Kegley researched and wrote about the history and culture of southwestern Virginia.  He focused on the settlement, trade, and transportation of the region.  In 1938 he completed his most famous work, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Kegley's Virginia Frontiers:  the Beginning of the Southwest, the Roanoke of Colonial Days, 1740-1783</title>.  As associate editor of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Mountain Empire</title>, Kegley wrote on the people, geography, industry, transportation, and historical sites of southwest Virginia.</p>
      <p>He also administered efforts of the Works Progress Administration in collecting and  documenting the history and culture of Virginia.  Kegley supervised W. P. A. workers in many southwestern Virginia counties as they transcribed court records, inventoried artifacts, interviewed residents, and visited historical sites.  He kept copies of many reports submitted by workers; these are indexed and arranged topically in the Kegley Library vertical file collection.</p>
      <p>Before his death on 4 May 1968, Kegley donated his extensive collection of monographs, periodicals, maps, documents, pamphlets, and other materials to Wytheville Community College Library.   The college designated this collection as the Kegley Library in his honor.</p>
