<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The son of Stephen Trinkle (1782-1859) and Sarah Ann Trollinger Trinkle (1794-1887), Elbert Sevier Trinkle was born in Pulaski County, Virginia 22 May 1834.  During the Civil War he served in Co. C, 4th Virginia Infantry Regiment (Pulaski Guard) which was part of the famed Stonewall Brigade.
</p>
<p>
Discharged from Confederate service in April 1862, Trinkle married Letitia Mary Sexton of Wytheville.  Together they had five sons and one daughter.  Their sons Thomas E., David D., and daughter Beulah died young.  Their remaining sons, Clarence M., William Sevier, and Elbert Lee, all survived childhood.
</p>
<p>
In 1874, Trinkle purchased property from Dolores Manricia Y Silva which was located at the intersection of Main and First streets in Wytheville, Virginia.  While part of the building housed the Farmers Bank, the rest of the property was the home of the Trinkle family.
</p>
<p>
According to the 1880 census, Trinkle, his wife and three surviving sons shared their home with two boarders and two servants.  One boarder was Annie Shelly, a teacher and native of England.  The other boarder was John Carter, a tanner of Irish descent.  Carter's name appears several times in the daybook regarding purchases of animal hides and skins.  One may conjecture that Carter and Trinkle shared a close business relationship.
</p>
<p>Elbert Sevier Trinkle died 4 January 1883.  His wife Letitia died 31 October 1897.  Their youngest child, Elbert Lee Trinkle (known as E. Lee Trinkle), served as governor of Virginia from 1922 to 1926.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The daybook of Elbert Sevier Trinkle records financial transactions between 15 November 1881 to 26 January 1883 (pages 3-57, 60-118, 542-544).  Transactions include payments for leather, sheepskins, snimal hides, tallow, plaster, wood, harnesses, and grocery items.  Firms and individuals with whom Trinkle conducted business include Carson and Guggenheimer, John Carter, Graham and Robinson, A. A. Holmes, J. W. Moyers, and Lancaster Smith.
</p>
<p>
Each entry records date, person, items or services purchased, and amount of purchases.  The daybook is arranged chronologically and lacks an index.
</p>
<p>
Several later entries dating circa 1957 appear on pages 119, 138-141, 148-149, 151, 153, 200-201, and 250-251.
