</head>
      <p>Dr. George Harold Hickox was born on 1 March 1903 in Spokane, Washington.  He was the son of Ryall Michael Hickox and Mary A. Doak Hickox.  He graduated from State University of Iowa with a bachelor and masters degree in engineering.  He earned a doctorate in mechanical engineering from the University of California in 1939.  He held various teaching and professional positions throughout his career including the Tennessee Valley Authority, University of Tennessee, National Science FOundation, Corps of Engineers, and Boeing Aircraft Company.  Upon his retirement in 1970 he embarked upon a sixteen year project to collect and document his family history, concentrating on the Doak family.  Hickox died on 11 December 1986.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The Doak Family Papers consist of card files, articles, correspondence, census data compilations, and family group sheets researched and compiled by George Harold Hickox.  The material, arranged into seven series, documents the Doak family and its allied lines.
</p>
      <p>Series I, Document File Folders, include 3,000 documents arranged by Hickox in 120 file folders.  He gave each document an individual number, i.e. D1.  The original arrangement system has been maintained.  Access into this series is provided through a card file system.  Each document has been indexed for family name, personal name, and place names in the Wythe County.  Folders contain correspondence, family group sheets, census data, and other materials.</p>
      <p>Series II, Card Files, have been kept in their original arrangement as devised by Dr. Hickox.  The files are arranged into four groups.  Group 1 consists of cards arranged alphabetically by first name of Doak family members in Generations 1-4.  Dr. Hickox counted the first generation as that of David Doak (1710-1787) and his siblings.  Group 2 consists of cards for Generation 5.  Group 3 consists of the Kirby family members.  Group 4 consists of miscellaneous Doak family and other family members.  Each card may give the birth, marriage, and death information of the family member.  Accuracy of this information has not been verified.</p>
      <p>Series III.   Census Data Compilations.  Dr. Hickox compiled these sheets from information contained in the United States Census schedules for 1790 to 1900.  Sheets are arranged chronologically but have not been indexed.  Frequent names appearing include Hickox (Hickock) and Doak.</p>
      <p>Series IV, Doak Descendants Association Records, include family group sheets and correspondence relating to the Doak family and allied families.  These records have not been indexed.</p>
      <p>Series V, Edmund Doak Papers, is a sub-collection consisting of family group sheets, Daughters of the American Revolution lineage charts and applications, and correspondence collected by Dr. Edmund Doak.  Accuracy of this information has not been verified.  These records have not been indexed.</p>
      <p>Series VI, Alexander Doak Family Group Sheets, were compiled by Hickox pertaining to the descendants of Alexander Doak, son of David Doak.  These records have not been indexed.</p>
      <p>Series VII, Correspondence, contains correspondence between Dr. Hickox and the Wythe County Historical Society; it details the donation of David Doak's gravestone to the Society.  These records have not been indexed.</p>
