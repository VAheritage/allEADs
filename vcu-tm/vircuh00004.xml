      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Dr. L. Benjamin Sheppard retired from ophthalmology in
         1986, after serving the Richmond area for 50 years. He was
         always very committed to his patients, colleagues, and friends
         by taking time to visit regularly, call, or write letters. Some of that correspondence may be found in this collection.</p>
      <p>Dr. Sheppard was born in Glen Allen, Virginia and raised on
         a farm. The rural setting gave him an appreciation for nature
         and taught him about life and death, which would serve him his
         entire life. He started his education at Glen Allen
         Elementary School, and attended John Marshall High School in
         Richmond, which he commuted to by train.</p>
      <p>Dr. Sheppard received his medical degree from the
         University of Virginia in 1930, and he kept in touch with his
         classmates by attending reunions. His medical training continued
         at the Medical College of Virginia from 1930 to 1933. From
         1933 to 1935 he received further training at the Manhattan Eye,
         Ear, and Throat Hospital in New York City. He spoke very
         highly in his reminiscences of the Broadway personalities he
         met while in New York.</p>
      <p>Before returning to Richmond to practice medicine, he
         received a job as ship surgeon on the SS EX ARCH an American
         passenger and cargo ship. The ship traveled the Mediterranean,
         stopping in Athens, Constanta, Romania, Malta, and the North
         African Coast to Casablanca. Upon returning to the States Dr.
         Sheppard received a telegram to return to MCV because he
         was needed to teach ophthalmology and treat patients. His love for travel and
         adventure would never end, and he would attend many
         international conferences over the course of his life.</p>
      <p>Dr. Sheppard did considerable work in ophthalmic research,
         focusing on anatomical and physiological aspects of eye
         disease. He was especially interested in congenital glaucoma
         and used buthalmic rabbits which were raised in Bar Harbor,
         Maine by the Jackson Laboratory. He used these animals to find
         the exact physical action on the eye caused by glaucoma. He was one of the founding members of the Richmond Eye and Ear Hospital where he undertook some of his research.
         </p>
      <p>Dr. Sheppard had an intense interest in medical history. He
         applied himself to extended research on the life and medical
         practice of John Peter Mettauer, of Prince Edward County.
         Mettauer was one of Virginia's pioneer physicians, and Dr.
         Sheppard's research on him can be found within the collection.
         Another historical project Dr. Sheppard was developing was a
         history of ophthalmology in Virginia. Although this project
         remains uncompleted it contains allot of research on specific
         individuals who practiced medicine in Virginia.</p>
      <p>Dr. Sheppard had memberships to many medical organizations
         such as; American Medical Association, Virginia Society of
         Ophthalmology, American Academy of Ophthalmology, American
         Ophthalmological Society, and the Virginia Society for the
         Prevention of Blindness. He also participated on the staffs of
         several Richmond hospitals. He was appointed to the
         Departments of Anatomy and Ophthalmology at the Medical
         College of Virginia, and he was a board member of the Richmond
         Eye and Ear Hospital.</p>
      <p>His community life involved him in the Bethlehem Lutheran
         Church. He was a member of the Richmond Rotary Club and
         presided as president in 1956. He was also a member of the
         board at the YMCA</p>
      <p>Dr. Sheppard lead his life with active determination never
         slowing till the very end. His research gave much insight to
         the field of ophthalmology, and his influence directed many
         students to this field. Dr. Sheppard took pride in being
         raised in the rural south.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers of Dr. L. Ben Sheppard consists of
         correspondence, organizational records, research and the
         publications created from his research. This collection
         focuses on the second half of his life from the early 1950s
         to 1987. The collection is broken up into three series, and
         the first series consists of his reminiscences from 1930 to 1983,
         plus the location of a oral history.</p>
      <p>Series two consists of correspondence and organizational
         records from Dr. Sheppard's different associations. Subseries
         A. is correspondence to friends, patients and colleagues.
         These records are in the same alphabetical order Dr. Sheppard
         left them in. They range from the early 1970s to 1987.
         Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., George P. Schultz, Paul Trible,
         and Dr. Peter Pastore are some of the people of note that Dr.
         Sheppard had correspondences with.Subseries B. contains
         records from hospitals, medical organizations and associations
         of Dr. Sheppard's. These records range from the early 1950s
         to 1987. The files are in alphabetical order using the first
         word from each file. These records illustrate the different
         associations Dr. Sheppard had personal as well as
         professional.</p>
      <p>Series three contains his research, and part A. deals with
         all his ophthalmological research. These files are also
         alphabetized by the first word on each file. The files contain
         research data, which is used to develop his publications and
         lectures. In many files the development of publications and
         lectures are well documented through notes and rough drafts.
         One file may contain everything associated with a certain
         publication. All the illustrations for these have been removed
         and placed with the originals for preservation purposes.
         Subseries B. deals with Dr. Sheppard's historical research,
         and has been divided into three parts. The first part contains
         his publication on Dr. Peter Mettauer and the research used to
         develop that publication. The second part has the reprints of
         Dr. Joseph A. White, which date back to the 1880s to the
         early 20th century. The third subseries is the development of
         the history of ophthalmology in Virginia, which Dr. Sheppard
         never had a chance to complete and publish. It contains many
         references and biographical sketches of early doctors in the
         medical history of Virginia. These records could be of great
         use to anyone doing historical medical research.</p>
