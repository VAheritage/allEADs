</head>
<p>Robert Benjamin Carper was born in Greenbrier, Virginia in 23 Nov. 1836. Second of seven children, Carper graduated from the Medical College of Virginia in 1861. While a doctor he could have joined the Army as
an officer, but he refused a commission and joined the 11th Virginia Volunteers, known as the Fincastle Rifles, as an infantryman to be with his two brothers. After a one year enlistment, and in poor health, he
reenlisted to stay with his brothers.
</p>
<p>Carper was injured in the Battle of Williamsburg on 5 May, 1862 and was sent to a hospital in Williamsburg where he died two weeks later on 19 May. He is buried in Williamsburg with his mother's family.
