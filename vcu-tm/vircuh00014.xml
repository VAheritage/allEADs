      <head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Stuart Circle Hospital opened in 1913. The location, at the beginning of Monument Ave, near the J.E.B. Stuart statute, was chosen for its quiet and peaceful vistas. Stuart Circle was opened by seven Richmond
doctors who felt that a more individual approach to medicine would be better for their patients. These doctors, led by Dr. Lewis C. Bosher, formed the hospitals first board of directors.
</p>
      <p>Designed by Charles M. Robinson, a prolific designer of public buildings in Virginia, the hospital was a six story red brick building. Much of the sixth floor was dedicated to a large roof garden. Each floor
had a solarium, a prominent feature of many hospitals built during this time, where patients could relax in what was thought of as the healing rays of the sun. The hospital was constructed with marble and tile
floors, high ceilings, and large stairways to allow for more natural light.
</p>
      <p>Stuart Circle was deemed a closed staff hospital, meaning that the doctors worked amongst themselves. This gave the hospital a feeling of familiarity. All of the doctors were members of the board of directors,
so they all had equal standing in administering the hospital. In 1928, the board grew from its initial seven members to ten, only adding doctors when a vacancy was created. The board created Stuart Circle
Hospital, Inc. and this body controlled the hospital until they joined Charter Medical Corporation in 1975. Stuart Circle's board was able to maintain its autonomy even after the merger.
</p>
      <p>Changes to the building were necessary as the hospital grew. By 1943, the roof garden and solariums had to be converted to patient rooms. In 1964, a new addition was built along the eastern side and was known
as the "new wing." In 1978, after an attempt to move the hospital to Bon Air in Chesterfield County, the hospital underwent a major renovation, bringing the total number of patient beds to over 150, and adding a
parking facility.
</p>
      <p>Stuart Circle was known for its innovations. In 1977, it started a pilot program and became one of the first hospitals to experiment with same-day surgery, as an alternative to hospital stays and their added
expenses. It was the first hospital in Virginia to perform echocardiograms, and was known as a leader in advanced heart care. Stuart Circle also established a program for the deaf via a video tape explaining
hospital procedures and policies, and was one of the first to champion the idea of patient education in healthcare.
</p>
      <p>Stuart Circle had a School of Nursing from 1914 to 1975. During those years it graduated 1,063 nurses. After 1928, it was affiliated with the Richmond Professional Institute and later, Virginia Commonwealth
University. The nursing students were now able to use their training at Stuart Circle to earn their bachelor's degree. One of its most distinguished directors was Charlotte Pfeiffer, RN who served on the Virginia
Board of Nursing from 1926-1936. She was also the President of the Virginia Nurses' Association from 1940-1942.
</p>
      <p>By 2000, the hospital was closed. The building underwent renovation and became luxury apartments named One Monument Ave.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collections most prominent feature includes several hardbound copies of the Minutes of the Board of Directors dated from 1946-1970. Also included are photographs and newspaper clippings regarding the
hospital that appeared in the <title render="italic">Richmond Times-Dispatch</title> or <title render="italic">News Leader</title>. Due to the fact these were the few records that were saved at the time of the hospital's closure, the collection is missing more detailed
information regarding the School of Nursing, and the daily operation of the hospital and its staff.
