<head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
<p>Dr. Seth Bridgman Perry was born in Williamston, NC on 16 December 1888. Originally a student at the University College of Medicine, Perry transferred to the Medical College of Virginia. Perry was the president
of the Masonic club, as well as a member of Kappa Psi fraternity. He earned his MD in 1914.
</p>
<p>Perry served in the Army in WW1 rising to the rank of Captain. While in the service he was able to attend the University of Edinburgh where he first studied surgery. Perry moved to Hopewell, VA after the war
joining the Hopewell Medical Society. In 1915, he was one of the founding doctors in establishing Hopewell Hospital, now known as the John Randolph Medical Center. During all his years of practice, Perry was a
member of the hospital administration as well as a staff doctor.
</p>
<p>Perry was active in the Hopewell community as well. From 1928 to 1955, he served as a member of the City Council and several years as vice-mayor. After many years of service to his community, Perry suffered a
heart attack in his office and died on 27 July, 1955 in Hopewell, VA.
