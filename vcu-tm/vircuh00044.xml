</head>
      <p>On November 3, 1870 nine Virginia dentists met in Richmond to establish an organization to "cultivate the science and the art of dentistry, and all its collateral branches, to elevate and sustain the professional character of dentists; and to promote amongst them mutual improvement, social intercourse and good will." This meeting marked the creation of the Virginia Dental Association (VDA) or the Virginia State Dental Association as it was named when first created. The VDA changed to its current name in 1970. The VDA was the successor to the first professional dental organization, the Virginia Society of Surgeon Dentists which was formed in 1842. </p>
      <p>An early goal of the VDA was to create standards and regulations for the profession. When the VDA was formed there were no statutes regulating the practice of dentistry in Virginia. The VDA spent several years drafting a bill to present to the state legislature culminating in the passage of the Dental Act of 1886. This act also established the Virginia Board of Dental Examiners. The VDA also successfully campaigned in 1915 to have a representative on the State Board of Health making Virginia the first state to include a dentist on such a board. In 1936 the VDA helped pass a bill that outlawed advertising dental services and prices as a means of protecting the public from unethical dental practices. This remained in effect until the early 1980s when the Federal Trade Commission ruled that truthful advertising could not be restricted. </p>
      <p> Dental education was another subject of much interest and debate for the VDA. They supported the creation of the first dental school in Virginia in 1893 at the University College of Medicine (UCM). In 1913, UCM merged with the Medical College of Virginia (MCV), which had created its own dental school in 1897. For a time some members of the VDA thought that dentist should obtain an MD degree to practice medicine. The Dental Act only required a diploma and a certificate from the state board to practice dentistry. A dental degree was not required to sit for the state board exam. A law requiring an MD was passed in 1910, but was repealed in 1914 before any provisions were enacted. </p>
      <p>The VDA, which is a component of the American Dental Association, created component societies in 1931. This was to better facilitate communication and professional development for member dentists throughout the state. Dentists who joined a component society also became members of the state and national associations through this tripartite structure. Virginia was divided into eight regions. Each region was arranged to have an existing local society within the area to become the component group where applicable. This arrangement is still in place today. The component societies are: </p>
      <list type="simple">
        <item>Component 1, Virginia Tidewater Dental Association, founded 1880</item>
        <item>Component 2, Peninsula Dental Society, founded 1934</item>
        <item>Component 3, Southside Dental Society, founded 1925</item>
        <item>Component 4, Richmond Dental Society, founded 1894</item>
        <item>Component 5, Piedmont Dental Society, founded 1916</item>
        <item>Component 6, Southwest Virginia Dental Society, founded 1917</item>
        <item>Component 7, Shenandoah Valley Dental Association, founded 1914</item>
        <item>Component 8, Northern Virginia Dental Society, founded 1931</item>
      </list>
      <p> The VDA began publishing its journal the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Bulletin of the Virginia State Dental Association</title> in 1923. After sporadic publication for the first ten years the VDA began publishing on a regular schedule. The number of issues published has varied from three to six. The journal is currently published quarterly. The title changed to the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Dental Journal</title> in 1964. It is a resource for members to find information about professional and scientific developments, legislative issues, and annual meetings. The journal also includes editorials and news updates from the component societies.</p>
      <p> An annual meeting of the VDA was held for members to come together and benefit from the mutual exchange of ideas and practical knowledge. The meetings offered an opportunity to focus on issues such as professional ethics, dental legislation, public health and service, and education. Much of the work of the organization was carried out by committees all of which were overseen by the governing body the Executive Council. The VDA had three elected officers the president, the president-elect, and the secretary-treasurer as well as several appointed officers including the editor of the journal. The VDA did not have a headquarters until the organization hired its first executive secretary in 1964 and she set up the headquarters in her home. Since that time it has been located in several areas around Richmond. Today the VDA is governed by a board of directors and still holds an annual meeting. The VDA continues to help improve the profession and its members, support dental education, promote public dental health, and provide outreach services to underserved populations.</p>
