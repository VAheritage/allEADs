         <p>Sadie Heath Cabaniss, daughter of Charles J. and Virginia
         R. Cabaniss, was born in Petersburg, Virginia on 8 October
         1865. She received a classical education at home before
         attending St. Timothy's School in Catonsville, Maryland where
         she graduated in 1874. Following a brief time as governess and
         teacher, Cabaniss attended the Johns Hopkins Hospital School
         of Nursing in Baltimore, Maryland. While at Hopkins Cabaniss
         became acquainted with Isabel Hampton Robb. Upon graduation in
         1893, Cabaniss held the position of night supervisor at the
         Johns Hopkins Hospital</p>
         <p>In 1895, Cabaniss became supervisor of the operating room
         at the Old Dominion Hospital connected to the Medical College
         of Virginia (MCV) in Richmond, Virginia. The MCV faculty asked
         Cabaniess to organize a training school for nurses. Cabaniss
         ran the school she organized on the Nightingale method of
         nursing education from 1895 until April of 1901.</p>
         <p>To respond to the needs of the sick poor in Richmond,
         Cabaniss and several of her former students from the Old
         Dominion Training School organized the Nurses' Settlement of
         Richmond in 1900. The group subsequently evolved into the
         Instructive Visiting Nurses Association (IVNA).</p>
         <p>Following the creation of the Nurses' Settlement, Cabaniess
         focues on the organization of trained nurses. She urged the
         formation of alumnea associations as various schools across
         the Commonwealth and in 1901 called members of the various
         associations to Richmond to organize the Virginia State
         Association of Nurses (now the Virginia Nurses Association)
         Cabaniss served as the first President and continued in the
         office until 1905. While serving as President, Cabaniss led
         the movement to secure licensing legislation to regulate
         nursing in Virginia</p>
         <p>Later in life, Cabaniss continued her work in public health
         in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. She returned to
         Virginia following World War I and worked in Virginia's
         northern neck area. Poor health forced her to retire from
         nursing work. Cabaniss died in Richmond on 11 July 1921.</p>
