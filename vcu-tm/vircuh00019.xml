</head>
      <p>Dr. James B Kenley was born 27 June, 1928 in Portsmouth Virginia. As a young man he often stated he wanted to be a doctor. After attending Asbury College in Kentucky, Kenley earned his MD at the University of
Virginia. While a student intern, Kenley developed an interest in public health while working at Riverside Hospital in Newport News. In the Navy, he conducted research at the Naval Research Laboratory working with
nuclear testing issues.
</p>
      <p>Kenley started his public health work when he joined the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) in 1956. Assigned to a rural district, he was instrumental in organizing and delivering the new Silk polio vaccine as
well as immunizing for measles. At the time these vaccines needed refrigeration to be effective so the task was a great one. Due to Kenley's efforts, Virginia was the first state to provide measles immunizations
at the local health department level.
</p>
      <p>Kenley, then the Director of the Division of Medical and Hospital Services, was assigned to implement the state's Medicare program. He oversaw the computerization of the entire Medicare process, another first
that was soon copied across the country. Kenley was appointed by Governor Mills Godwin to be the State Health Commissioner in 1976. His next addressed the problem of pollution to shellfish and other seafood. He
instituted a system of continuous evaluation for environmental programs which rapidly allowed the VDH to focus on the most dangerous pollutants.
</p>
      <p>In 1986, Kenley accepted an offer to be the Chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University. During his time as chairman, Kenley wrote about public health issues such as
AIDS, kepone, and lead poisoning. He retired from public service in 1992.
