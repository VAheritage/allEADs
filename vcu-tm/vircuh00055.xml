<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>J.C. (Julian Chiles) Snellings, born December 28, 1857 in Manchester, Virginia was the son of John Snellings and Virginia Elliot Chiles. Snellings opened a pharmacy in 1875, located at 1226 Hull Street in Manchester. For a time during the 1890s he partnered with pharmacist William G. Burgess. In addition to medicines the pharmacy sold toiletries, perfume, tobacco, and cigars. Snellings was married twice. His first wife, Edna W. Matthews died in 1894 and he remarried in 1898 to Eva Marshall. Snellings died November 26, 1928 and is interred at Maury Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.</p>
<p>The following is a description of Snellings' pharmacy from <title render="italic">The City of Manchester, Virginia Board of Trade</title>, 1896:</p>
<p><title render="doublequote">The citizens of Manchester should congratulate themselves upon having in their midst such a thoroughly appointed pharmacy, one in which every confidence can be placed, equally as regards goods, proficiency, and fair charges, as that of J. C. Snellings, who has been identified with the drug trade of our city for the past twenty years, and by long experience has acquired high qualifications as one of our oldest and ablest druggist. The Doctor's Julian Chill Pills and Chapped Skin Cure are, indeed, messengers of relief to the suffering. A large stock of drugs, medicine and toilet articles are always on hand.</title></p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Bound volume (7.5 x 9.5" 282 pages, 69 blank pages), used to keep preparation instructions on various medicines and other compounds sold by the pharmacy. The preparations are a mix of Snellings' own formulas and those copied from other sources. The book includes formulas for medicines in various forms such as ointments, tonics, mints, pills, and salves. There are also recipes for other items like cologne, inks, and flavored syrups. It also includes a tobacco flavoring prepared especially for the Manchester Tobacco Company. Enclosed in the volume are loose items such as additional preparation notes and information from Sharp and Dohme, Manufacturing Chemists regarding the formula for a cod liver oil preparation. This book provides insight into the preparation of prescriptions and the types of medicines dispensed by pharmacies in the late 19th and early 20th century.
