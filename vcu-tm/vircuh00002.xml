      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Joseph James Anderson was born on January 6, 1870, at
Hopeful in Louisa County, Virginia. He was the son of Archer
Hart and Catherine Massie Shelton Anderson. As a young man,
Anderson attended private school at his grandfathers home,
where he was taught by his two maiden aunts. The young J.J.
Anderson also worked as a telegraph operator for the Norfolk
and Western Railway Co. In 1891 Anderson entered the Medical
College of Virginia and graduated with the class of 1893.</p>
      <p>Dr. Anderson began practicing medicine in 1893 at Waltons
Store in Louisa County. The doctor later moved to Goochland
where he served on the local board of health, and was active
in the liberty loan drives during World War I. He practiced as
a family practitioner in Goochland until 1922.</p>
      <p>In 1922 Dr. Anderson moved to Richmond where he spent the
rest of his life. His Richmond home and office was located at
2220 Grove Avenue in the fan district. Anderson was a member
of the American Medical Association, the Richmond Academy of
Medicine, and the Medical Society of Virginia in which he was
a 50 year member. He was also a member of the Dove Lodge
Number 51, A.F.8 A.M., and the Tabernacle Baptist Church. Dr.
Anderson was available for emergency medical services, state
side, during both world w</p>
      <p>Dr. Anderson was married to Temple Drudge Anderson. The
couple had no children. On May 19th, 1949 at the age of 79,
Dr. Anderson died at his home in Richmond. He was buried at
the Hollywood Cemetery.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers of Joseph J. Anderson, cover from his
matriculation at MCV in 1891 to his death in 1949. The
majority of the papers are personal, and have been arranged
into four series.</p>
      <p>Series I (1892-1980) contains a wide variety of
correspondence and legal documents. What stands out are
various letters of recommendation written by prominent MCV
physicians recommending Dr. Anderson to positions at the state
hospital in Petersburg, as well as the position of doctor to
the penitentiary farm. The letters recommending the doctor to
the penitentiary farm are all addressed to Governor Charles T.
O'Ferrall. These letters are accompanied by 3 petitions signed
by MCV professors, and Virginia politicians.</p>
      <p>Also included in this series are license applications to
practice, spanning the years, 1893-1908, from Louisa and
Goochland counties. There is a letter confirming his
availability for emergency medical services during World War I
from 1918, as well as questions to Dr. Anderson that were
asked during a court case. No date accompanies the questions.
This series also has one biographical sketch, as well as a
letter pertaining to the collection both from 1980.</p>
      <p>Series II (1906-1944) simply represents some of Dr.
Anderson's financial records. The series consists of two small
ledger books, which date from 1/1/06-1/1/08. The books
correspond to his Goochland practice. There is also one large
ledger book, which includes accounts from the years
1/1/40-5/44. The names and addresses of some of the patients
are listed as well as visit prices.</p>
      <p>Series III (1891-1948)comprises Dr. Anderson's educational
records. Included in this series are three subseries, the
first being the actual school materials and the other two
being certificates and photographs, respectively. The contents
of subseries A are his matriculation cards, graduation papers,
one note book, two exams, two session books, which contain
class descriptions, and Alumni matters. The Alumni matters
contain lists of deceased doctors from various graduating
classes at MCV. Subseries B contains certificates awarded to
Dr. Anderson over the years. Included is Dr. Anderson's actual
diploma, there are also four more certificates dating back to
1905. There are two fellowship certificates, one from the
Medical Society of Virginia (1905), and the other from the
American Medical Association (1916). The other two are the
Commonwealth of Virginia certificate to practice in Goochland
from 1912, and the Medical Society of Virginia certificate
commemorating 50 years of service awarded in 1948. Subseries C
is the group of photos. The subseries contains one large
unidentified photo, as well as one 1893 MCV class photo. There
are also two small photos, one of which has Dr. Anderson on
horseback in a 1921 picture. There is one portrait photo from
1933 and one group shot of the surviving members of the class
of 1893 taken in 1943 which was printed in the 
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Richmond Times-Dispatch</title>.</p>
      <p>Series IV (1896-1949) is printed materials and miscellany.
The majority of materials are magazines and publications
related to MCV and other medical organizations. The dates
range from 1938 to 1949. There are also some non-MCV materials
that Dr. Anderson collected for his own personal enjoyment.
The collection also includes one medical lexicon, printed in
1890. Finally, the collection contains a rather large
scrapbook. It has no order, no index, and it is hard to
pinpoint any date range.</p>
      <p>The scrapbook consists of many drug ads and drug uses
printed by drug companies. Therefore, it is easy to find an
entry with the heading, "neurasthenia," with the description
and cure provided by William S. Merrill Chemical Co., to give
one example. There are also articles from medical journals
pasted in. An example of this is, "Diet in Chronic Heart
Disease," by Prof. Theodor Schott M.D. from 
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Clinical
Excerpts</title> November-December 1904. The illnesses in the
scrapbook all appear to be common. This is appropriate as Dr.
Anderson was a family practitioner.</p>
