<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Annie Laurie Miffleton Linton was born in Petersburg, Virginia on October 13, 1901 to Clarence and Ardenia Miffleton. Linton attended the Virginia City Hospital Training School for Nurses located at the corner of Eleventh and Clay streets in Richmond. She was a member of the final class to graduate from the school in 1922. Linton worked as a nurse in Richmond and in Norfolk. During her retirement she volunteered at Norfolk General Hospital as part of the patient relations program. Linton was married to Thomas Harrison Linton. She died on March 24, 1994 and is interred at Hampton National Cemetery in Hampton, Virginia.</p>  
<p>The Virginia Hospital Training School for Nurses was established by the University College of Medicine (UCM) in 1893. It continued the school until 1913 when UCM and the Medical College of Virginia (MCV) consolidated. At that time the City of Richmond took over control of the Virginia Hospital and it was used for clinical teaching by MCV. From 1914 to 1922 the city operated its own training school, known as the Virginia City Hospital Training School for Nurses. In 1922 an arrangement was made to allow graduates of the various nursing training schools affiliated with either MCV or UCM to join the general Alumni Association of the Medical College of Virginia, including graduates from the Virginia City Hospital training program.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This is a small collection of items which includes Linton's nursing diploma, a temporary permit to practice from the Graduate Nurses Examining Board of Virginia, a certificate from the Virginia Nurses Board of Examiners, a photograph of her nursing class, and another in her uniform, all from 1922. Also included is a certificate from the Texas Nurses Board of Examiners, 1926 and an article about Linton receiving the Community Betterment Award from the Norfolk Junior Woman's Club in 1978 for her volunteer work at Norfolk General Hospital. This is a significant collection as it contains items related to the 1922 class of the Virginia City Hospital Training School for Nurses, the last class to graduate from the school.
