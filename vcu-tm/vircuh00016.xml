</head>
      <p>Dr. Stuart Donald Scott was born 1893 in Connellsville, PA. Scott was a well educated man who never stopped learning. He earned his MD from MCV in 1919, receiving his license to practice in 1920. By 1923, he
was a certified by the United States Interior department as a first aid and mine rescue specialist and was licensed to practice in Kentucky.
</p>
      <p>By the 1930s Scott had migrated to Gainesville, Florida where he would settle and establish his private practice. Scott then earned post-graduate degrees from George Washington and Temple University medical
schools specializing in Ophthalmology, Otology and Laryngology. By the late 1950s, Scott earned proficiency in clinical hypnosis as well.
</p>
      <p>Scott was a well respected member of the Gainesville community up until his death on 23 February, 1970. He was 77.
