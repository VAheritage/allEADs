<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Carl F. Emswiller, Jr. was born in Washington, D.C. on October 21, 1935. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1953 to October 1957 as Aviation Storekeeper, First Class. Emswiller went on to attend the Medical College of Virginia, School of Pharmacy. He graduated with a B.S. in 1962. That same year he joined Eugene V. White at his ground breaking, office-based pharmacy in Berryville, Virginia as an associate pharmacist. During this time he and White created one of the nation's first pharmaceutical care centers. This was a very innovative idea which eschewed the traditional pharmacy model in favor of a more patient focused pharmacy. </p>
<p>In 1968, Emswiller purchased his own pharmacy in Leesburg, Virginia where continued to hone the model for the patient-focused pharmacy. He moved his pharmacy in 1974 to a medical office building co-located with physicians and other health professionals. The office-based model eliminated the sale of commercial goods and was equipped with a private consulting room. Patient care services expanded to include patient medication record reviews as well as blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol monitoring in collaboration with local physicians. This model of pharmacy service raised the pharmacist to the level of health care partner rather than simply a medication dispenser. Both White's and Emswiller's pharmacies served as examples for other pharmacists throughout the county.</p>
<p> Emswiller was actively engaged with his profession as a member of various professional groups including the Northern Virginia Society of Pharmacists, the Virginia Pharmaceutical Association (currently known as the Virginia Pharmacists Association), the American Pharmaceutical Association (APhP, now known as the American Pharmacists Association), the American College of Apothecaries (ACA), the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists, the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, the American Association of the Colleges of Pharmacy, and the National Association of Retail Druggist. He held numerous positions over the years in these groups such as the chair of the ACA, member of the APhA Board of Directors, and president of the Northern Virginia Society of Pharmacists, to name a few. Emswiller also served as an associate clinical instructor of Pharmacy at Virginia Commonwealth University, MCV campus for more than 25 years and also served as the chair of the Virginia State Board of Pharmacy.</p>
<p>Emswiller's innovation and dedication were recognized many times throughout his career. The most prestigious of the awards he received was the Remington Honor Medal in 1999, which is the profession of pharmacy's highest honor. Other awards include Virginia Pharmacist of the Year, 1981; the American Pharmaceutical Association's Daniel B. Smith Award, the highest honor given to a community pharmacist, 1983; Loudoun County Man of the Year, 1987; Outstanding Alumnus Award, MCV, Pharmacy Division, 1991; Virginia Pharmaceutical Association Outstanding Pharmacist Award, 1994; the Virginia Commonwealth University Alumni Star Award, 1999; and the American College of Apothecaries J. Leon Lascoff Memorial Award, 2000.</p>
<p>In 2000, Emswiller retired from his practice. He died on December 10, 2009. His wife Jewell, who also shared his passion and enthusiasm for collaborative, patient-centered pharmacy practice, endowed the Jewell and Carl Emswiller, Jr. Interprofessional Symposium, which was first held in 2013. The symposium is committed to educating health professional students and practitioners about providing meaningful patient care through innovation in interprofessional practice.</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection consists of correspondence, clippings, presentations, publications, photographs, speeches and other related materials. The items span Emswiller's 38 year career in pharmacy. There is a great deal of personal correspondence written to Emswiller by his colleagues and friends upon receipt of his many awards. The materials in the collection also provide insight into the evolvement of office-based, patient-centered pharmacy practices. This was a very innovative approach which spanned the transition from the traditional pharmacy of the early 20th century to the pharmacy model of the early 21st century.
