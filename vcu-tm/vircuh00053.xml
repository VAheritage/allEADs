</head>
<p>Henry Caravati Johnston was born on May 14, 1895 in Richmond, Virginia. He attended Old Point Comfort College at Fort Monroe and in 1912 was accepted at the University College of Medicine (UCM) located in Richmond. UCM merged with the Medical College of Virginia (MCV) in June of 1913. Johnston continued his education, but now as a student at MCV. While in medical school he was a member of Phi Rho Sigma medical society, chair of the Annual Board of Publication, and advertising manager of the <title render="italic">X-Ray</title>, the college yearbook.
</p>
<p>Johnston graduated in 1916 and went to Roosevelt Hospital in New York City for his residency. He served as a Navy surgeon during World War I and was stationed in Santo Domingo. After the war, he practiced in New York City and later opened a private practice in New Jersey. He was a member of the New York Alumni Association of MCV. Johnson died in January 1987.</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This is a small, but notable collection as it contains items from the last class to matriculate at the University College of Medicine and it bridges the gap of the two medical schools. This collection includes documents and photographs from 1912-1938. Materials include an illustrated note from a colleague, Johnston's UCM acceptance letter, matriculation card for the 1912-1913 session, first year report card, certificates of completion for his sophmore and junior years, 1916 graduation program embossed with both the MCV and UCM seals, photograph of the 1928 MCV New York alumni, a copy of the <title render="italic">Centennial, Medical College of Virginia, 1838-1938</title> for the New York alumni featuring a biography of Simon Baruch, and the 1938 centennial issue of <title render="italic">The Bulletin of the Medical College of Virginia</title>.
