      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Montgomery County was formed from Fincastle County in 1776, and the county court first met on 7 January 1777. Part of Botetourt County was added in 1790. Part of Pulaski County was added in 1842. The county was named for Richard Montgomery, who was killed in the American assault on Quebec late in 1775.
</p>
      <p>Fincastle County was created from Botetourt County in 1772, and the county court first met on 5 January 1773. Fincastle County became extinct on 31 December 1776 when it was divided to form Montgomery, Washington and Kentucky Counties. The county was named probably for George, Viscount Fincastle, Lord Dunmore's son; for John Murray, fourth earl of Dunmore, Viscount Fincastle; or for the town of Fincastle, Virginia, which was established in 1772 and named for George, Viscount Fincastle.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Montgomery County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1773-1920, are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, business records, or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed. </p>
<p>Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. </p>

          <p>Freedom suits heard together for the most part.  Causes traveled around to several localities including Giles, Rockbridge, and Roanoke counties in addition to higher appeals courts. Causes hinged on descent from common ancestor Flora, and enslaved person, who was "carried off from Massachusetts," freed in Connecticut, then sold illegally into slavery from New York. This account is disputed by other deponents. There was question about whether she was illegally imported into Virginia as a slave. Many depositions from state of Massachusetts. Cases include letter from clerk of Roanoke County saying that he feels some of the papers in causes may have been deliberately mislaid. Plaintiffs do not seem to have achieved their freedom. Decision may have turned on legal technicalities of non-importation oaths and authorized/non-authorized depositions. See published opinions in Grattan's Virginia Reports. Appeal files stored at West Virginia state archives - Virginia Court of Appeals at Lewisburg MS79-83.
