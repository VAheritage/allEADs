         <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
         <p>Richmond FitzGerald Bemiss (b. 1922) was a member of the
         Virginia General Assembly, serving in both the House of
         Delegates (1955-1959) and the Senate (1960-1967). His papers
         reflect his career in the Assembly, his work on various
         government commissions, and other related political activities
         and interests. Researchers interested in these subjects may
         also want to look at his book, The General Assembly: 1955-
         1967.</p>
         <p>Bemiss entered the House of Delegates at the height of the
         school desegregation crisis and served in that body through
         the extra session of 1959. Although often voting with the
         conservative majority, Bemiss was nonetheless independent of
         the dominant Byrd organization and often took positions
         contrary to the Byrd line. As a member of the Gray commission
         on Public Education, Bemiss supported "local option," was
         opposed to massive resistance, and approved of Lindsay
         Almond's "freedom of choice" compromise.</p>
      </bioghist>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The collection begins with materials pertaining to the 1955
         election, organized as described above. Correspondence,
         addresses, statements and clippings concerning the extra
         session of 1955 and subsequent referendum on the revision of
         the state Constitution to allow tuition grants follow. Letters
         from Governor Thomas B. Stanley and Dabney S. Lancaster
         document Bemiss's efforts in organizing pro-convention
         forces.</p>
         <p>The 1956 session of the general assembly was noteworthy for
         the passage of a resolution of "Interposition." This doctrine
         asserts that individual states have the power to declare a
         decision of the Supreme Court unconstitutional until the issue
         is settled through the amendment process. Although eventually
         voting with the majority in support of the resolution, Bemiss
         expressed doubts about the action in a letter to Governor
         Stanley. A letter from Lewis F. Powell, Jr., later an
         associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, also
         questions the assembly's action. Both these letters are found
         in the folder of correspondence and addresses, which is
         followed by newspaper clippings, mostly from the editorial
         series by James J. Kilpatrick in the Richmond News Leader.
         Miscellaneous "Interposition" materials include addresses and
         copies of resolutions from other states.</p>
         <p>In 1956 Bemiss was appointed to fill a vacancy on the
         Commission on Public Education, chaired by State Senator
         Garland Gray. Materials concerning the Gray Commission consist
         of correspondence and statements, including a joint statement
         by Bemiss and fellow delegate J. Randolph Tucker announcing
         their dissent from the majority report. Correspondence
         concerning the 1956 extra session is mostly from constituents
         concerning the proposed school closing bills. 1957 general
         correspondence and election materials follow. General
         correspondence includes letters from Harry Flood Byrd, Sr.,
         concerning the settlement of a displaced Hungarian family in
         Richmond. General correspondence for 1958 and 1959 and a
         folder of material concerning the 1958 session of the General
         Assembly precede material concerning the special session of
         1959.</p>
         <p>In January 1959 both the U. S. and state supreme courts
         declared Virginia's school closing laws unconstitutional. The
         assembly, meeting in extra session, replaced the legislation
         with the Commission on Education's "freedom of choice" plan,
         which provided for the possibility of some integration. Bemiss
         served on the Perrow Commission, and his papers contain
         commission minutes, reports, and statements from a public
         hearing on March 6 of that year.</p>
         <p>Bemiss ran for the State Senate in 1959. Researchers are
         again reminded that the campaign materials are arranged as
         described on the first page of this summary. Campaign
         correspondence includes letters from Lewis F. Powell, who
         advised Bemiss and helped draft statements. Two folders
         containing budget and financial data for the 1960 session
         follow.</p>
         <p>The extra session of 1963 dealt with the poll tax issue and
         amending the Virginia Constitution before the 1964
         presidential selection. Materials include letters from
         constituents, copies of resolutions and bills, and clippings.
         Correspondence concerning various bills introduced during the
         1964 session is arranged by bill, with an index located in the
         front of the folder. Folders concerning the extra sessions of
         1964 and 1965, both of which dealt with redistricting, include
         addresses, population statistics, a copy of a federal court
         decision , and a Harry Byrd, Sr., statement on the voting
         rights act. Senate materials from 1965-1967 follow, arranged
         as previously described.</p>
         <p>In 1967, FitzGerald Bemiss announced his retirement from
         the Senate, citing a need to devote more time to his
         family-run businesses. Materials concerning his announcement
         not to seek re-election include correspondence, clippings,
         editorials, and a statement. Memoranda, mainly of Carter O.
         Lowance, executive secretary to the governor, describes major
         actions of each Assembly session from 1956 to 1968.</p>
         <p>The next section of the collection pertains to various
         election campaigns, presidential, senatorial, and
         gubernatorial from 1952 to 1985. Located in box 3, these
         papers mainly consist of campaign literature and clippings and
         precinct returns from Richmond newspapers. In some campaigns,
         however, Bemiss was more actively involved and generated a
         larger number of records. In the 1966 Senate Democratic
         primary, Bemiss worked for the incumbent, A. Willis Robertson,
         in organizing and fund-raising in the third district.
         Correspondence with Robertson concerns the incumbent's age and
         health as compared with that of former Senator Carter Glass.
         Bemiss also served as a budgetary and financial advisor for
         Fred G. Pollard in the 1969 Democratic gubernatorial primary,
         Harry F. Byrd in his 1970 campaign for Senate, and Richard D.
         Obenshain in his 1978 quest for the Republican gubernatorial
         nomination. The section concludes with a folder of election
         analyses by Larry Sabato, a folder of Richmond City Democratic
         Committee memoranda, correspondence, statements and 1965
         redistricting information, a folder of Republican party
         appeals, and a folder of miscellaneous election materials.</p>
         <p>The rest of the collection has been arranged in roughly
         chronological fashion around three subjects that interested
         Senator Bemiss: government, education, and the environment.
         These papers reflect Bemiss's service on a number of
         government commission, civic organizations, and community
         affairs groups. Many of these relate to general assembly
         activities that either spanned several sessions or continued
         after his 1967 retirement.</p>
         <p>Records pertaining to government begin with several folders
         of otherwise only loosely related materials. The first folder
         in this section concerns the building of a parking lot for the
         Virginia Museum. This is followed by papers concerning the
         standardization of annual reports for the various executive
         departments. In January 1961 Bemiss attended a White House
         conference on aging and conference information as well as
         Bemiss's statements opposing medial aid for the elderly
         through social security, are included in this material.</p>
         <p>Addresses concerning the findings of the Commission on
         State and Local Revenues and Expenditures follow. Appointed by
         Governor Albertis S. Harrison in 1962, the commission's
         purpose was to study new and additional sources of revenue.
         Although it was generally understood that this meant preparing
         the way for a state sales tax by eliminating the legal
         barriers and developing plans for distributing the proceeds,
         other actions were also recommended. As chairman of the Local
         Revenues and Expenditures Committee, Bemiss proposed
         legislation prohibiting the underassessment and undertaxation
         of real estate at the expense of public utility facilities,
         whose burden was then passed on to other localities. A folder
         marked "public utilities' mostly concerns several bills
         introduced during the 1966 session seeking to abolish this
         common practice.</p>
         <p>Correspondence with Richmond City Council primarily
         concerns proposed changes in the city charter providing for
         staggered four-year terms for the city's state senators. State
         planning materials concern the establishment of a division to
         oversee long-range planning.</p>
         <p>In 1966 Bemiss was appointed by Governor Mills E. Godwin to
         the Virginia Metropolitan Area Study Commission. Under the
         chairmanship of Virginia Polytechnic Institute president, T.
         Marshall Hahn, the commission examined problems created by
         Virginia's growing and shifting population. Bemiss's
         subcommittee on Governmental Structure proposed redrawing
         county boundaries to reflect twentieth-century demands, and
         establishing service and planning districts as alternatives to
         annexation in meeting problems created in multi-jurisdictional
         area. These ideas were, quite naturally, opposed by many in
         the legislature who viewed the proposal as a threat to local
         autonomy. Commission minutes, correspondence, and reports, as
         well as subcommittee correspondence begin box 4. Materials
         concerning the Commission on the Legislative Process, on which
         Bemiss also served, follow. Papers pertaining to the
         Commission on Constitutional Revision again reflect Bemiss's
         interest in multi-locality planning districts. Bemiss planned
         the inauguration of Governor Linwood Holton in 1970 and this
         material consists of memoranda, seating charts, invitations,
         and a program.</p>
         <p>The section concerning education begins with a folder of
         general correspondence, consisting of constituent requests,
         invitations to speak, and copies of addresses. Seven folders
         labeled "State Council of Higher Education" follow. Bemiss was
         a patron of the bill which created the council, whose purpose
         was to promote and develop a coordinated system of higher
         education in the state. This material, which includes
         correspondence, memoranda, and reports, concerns the creation
         of the council, its early operation, and a VALC report,
         "education of Scientists, Engineers and Other Specialists."
         Other subjects include the separation of colleges in the
         William and Mary System (including Richmond Professional
         Institute) and inter-library cooperation in sharing technical
         services and facilities.</p>
         <p>Correspondence with the State Board of Education precedes
         materials related to the Commission on Public Education
         chaired by William B. Spong (not to be confused with the Gray
         Commission). Correspondence, statements, and reports document
         the commission's work, which involved evaluation of school
         curricula and teacher certification requirements. Materials
         pertaining to the Bureau of Educational Research concern the
         establishment of a permanent agency to conduct research in
         education. Budget materials for 1964 concern cuts in higher
         education and include statements by Bemiss and University of
         Virginia President Edgar F. Shannon. A second 1964 folder
         documents an unsuccessful attempt to restrict enrollment in
         Virginia state colleges by out-of-state students. Materials
         pertaining to the Virginia Institute of Scientific Research
         concern the establishment of an institution for graduate
         research in Richmond. Papers of two Richmond organizations,
         the Citizens for Excellent Public Schools and the Ad Hoc
         Committee on Public Schools, demonstrate their commitment to
         public education during the school busing controversy in
         1971-1972. This section concludes with miscellaneous speeches
         and clippings on education.</p>
         <p>The remainder of the Bemiss papers reflect his interest in
         conservation and the environment. Included in this section are
         records concerning several commissions, the Virginia Outdoor
         Recreation Study Commission (1964-1966), the Governor's
         Special Commission on Water Resources (1965-1966), and the
         Governor's Commission on Virginia' Future (1982-1985). Related
         material concerns water pollution and parks.</p>
         <p>Bemiss was chairman of the Virginia Outdoor Recreation
         Study Commission, which formulated a comprehensive plan to
         protect and develop Virginia' scenic, natural, and historic
         resources. The Virginia Outdoors Plan, passed by the 1966
         assembly, created a Commission of Outdoor Recreation to
         acquire and maintain parks, scenic areas, camping grounds, and
         other sites for public use. The legislation also created the
         Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission (now the Division of
         Historic Landmarks). Records of the VORSC consist of
         correspondence, addresses, reports, press releases and
         clippings. Landmarks Commission materials primarily concern
         the acquisition of open space easements at "Old Mansion,"
         Caroline County and at "Wakefield," Westmoreland County, and
         attempts by the owners of "Tuckahoe," Goochland County to
         change the route of a proposed highway. Correspondence
         concerning open space easements is primarily with George C.
         Freeman, a lawyer who designed the law allowing property
         owners to grant easements designating areas where future
         development would be prohibited. The Virginia Outdoors Plan
         also created the Virginia Outdoors Foundation to encourage
         private philanthropy towards conservation efforts of the
         state.</p>
         <p>Bemiss also served as chairman of the Governor's Special
         Committee on Water Resources, a commission created to
         determine the effects of growth on the state's future water
         resources. An additional folder concerning water resources
         consists primarily of articles on drainage basins of various
         state rivers. Materials concerning water pollution consist of
         a memo on the subject to Governor Linwood Holton and the
         governor's acknowledgment.</p>
         <p>Information and brochures concerning several state parks
         begin box 6. The next folder pertains to a trip to the Eastern
         Shore in 1960 and Bemiss's subsequent article on natural areas
         for Virginia Wildlife magazine.</p>
         <p>The following three folders demonstrate Bemiss's interest
         in both conservation and metropolitan planning. Materials of
         the Richmond Regional Planning Commission, the Richmond
         Regional Park Authority, and the Capital Region Park Authority
         concern cooperative community efforts in creating open space
         areas in the Richmond metropolitan area. General
         correspondence concerning the James River precedes materials
         pertains to a study commission report on deepening the James
         River channel. Articles of incorporation, by-laws, and reports
         of the Richmond James River Association, of which Bemiss was
         president, reflect that organization's apprehension over water
         usage and the river's flow. The next four folders, consisting
         of correspondence, clippings, newsletters and maps, concern
         the construction of a downtown expressway and its effects on
         natural areas along the James River. Although the expressway
         was built, parts of the historic Kanawha Canal were preserved
         and restored and James River Park was established.</p>
         <p>In 1982, Bemiss was appointed to the Governor's Commission
         on Virginia's Future, which was chaired by former Senator
         William B. Spong. The commission's mission was to assess state
         needs and provide planning and direction into the twenty-first
         century. Correspondence, committee assignments, meeting
         summaries, final reports and clippings precede records
         pertaining to the Environment and Natural Resources Task
         Force, which Bemiss chaired. These papers are arranged
         topically (these topics being sub-headings in the final
         report). Subjects include: water, land use, waste management,
         the Chesapeake Bay and fisheries. A final report and related
         papers of the Government and Planning Task Force follow.</p>
         <p>In conjunction with his service on the Future Commission,
         Bemiss participated in a conference sponsored by the Virginia
         Institute on Government, in October 1985, on the "Future of
         the Virginia Environment." The collection contains a copy of
         the conference's final statement. Miscellaneous correspondence
         concerning parks and water and addresses pertaining to
         environmental issues conclude this section.</p>
         <p>Miscellaneous speeches and addresses, mostly from
         dedication, naturalization, and award ceremonies, precede a
         folder of general miscellany, which includes a 1958 address on
         fiscal management by Senator Harry F. Byrd.</p>

         <head>Organization</head>
         <p>As much as possible, the original arrangement of Bemiss's
         papers has been maintained. His General Assembly papers are
         organized by session, with the same basic arrangement
         recurring for each session. Each session's records usually
         begin with materials pertaining to the biennial elections.
         These consist of individual folders of campaign correspondence
         (appeals for and acknowledgments of support, petitions,
         invitations to speak), addresses (including radio and
         television spots), campaign materials (such as examples of
         advertising, sample ballots, literature, platform drafts,
         budget information, voting lists, and clippings), letters of
         congratulation (often including letters from Harry F. Byrd, J.
         Vaughan Gary, and various Virginia governors), and statements
         of expense. Folders containing general correspondence for that
         year follow. These typically include miscellaneous letters
         from constituents, appeals for support and endorsement,
         applications for appointment, invitations, and letters of
         appreciation. Researchers should note that papers relating to
         specific commissions or legislative actions that overlap
         several sessions are arranged by subject and appear later in
         the collection.</p>
