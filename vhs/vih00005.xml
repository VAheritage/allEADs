          <p>Thomas Lewis Preston was born on the family estate
               "Smithfield," in Montgomery County. He attended
               Rockbridge Academy, Washington College and the College
               of William and Mary before reading law in Richmond in
               1804. He returned to Montgomery but settled in Lexington
               after his marriage to Edmonia Madison Randolph, daughter
               of Edmund Randolph, in 1806. TLP was a major in the
               Virginia militia as well as a member of the Virginia
               General Assembly from 1806-1811. In 1807 he was
               appointed by the assembly to act as agent in recovering
               funds due Virginia land warrant holders from surveyors
               in Kentucky. He was also a trustee of Ann Smith Academy
               in Rockbridge County, one of the earliest incorporated
               female academies in the South.</p>
          <p>The papers of Thomas Lewis Preston consist of
               correspondence, legal documents, accounts and estate
               materials. Much of the correspondence deals with the
               affairs of Ann Smith Academy, state and national
               politics and family matters. Although there are only
               about forty items of correspondence, a good deal of this
               comes from prominent Virginians. Among these
               correspondents are: Peter Vivian Daniel, associate
               justice of the Supreme Court; John Floyd, governor of
               Virginia and brother-in-law of TLP; Thomas Gholson,
               Virginia congressman; Andrew Moore, Virginia senator;
               James Pleasants, Virginia senator; General John Preston,
               treasurer of Virginia and brother of TLP; Benjamin
               Howard, first territorial governor of Missouri and
               congressman from Kentucky; Edward Coles, second governor
               of Illinois and secretary to President James Madison;
               and John Coalter, judge of the Court of Appeals and
               delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of
               1829-30.</p>

          <p>Elizabeth Randolph Preston married William Armistead
               Cocke of "Oakland," Cumberland and Powhatan counties,
               where the couple lived. After the Civil War, ERPC
               offered "Derwent," a small house on the Powhatan section
               of the "Oakland" estate, to General Robert E. Lee. Lee
               and his family lived at "Derwent" from June-September,
               1865, when he assumed the presidency of Washington
               College.</p>
          <p>This collection contains several items of
               correspondence and obituaries concerning ERPC. There is
               also a great deal of estate material, particularly
               concerning the disposition of land she owned in
               Louisville, Kentucky. This correspondence is among her
               sons, John Preston Cocke (executor) and Edmund Randolph
               Cocke and their attorneys and agents in Louisville.
               George Washington Custis Lee is also an occasional
               correspondent in this material.</p>

          <p>On November 15, 1870, John Preston Cocke, youngest
               son of William Armistead Cocke and Elizabeth Randolph
               Preston Cocke, married Eliza Bernard Meredith, daughter
               of Judge John Alexander Meredith and thus several items
               from the Meredith family are included in the collection.
               Judge Meredith (1814-1882) was a lawyer and delegate to
               the Constitutional Convention of 1850-51, commonwealth's
               attorney from Hanover County, and judge of the Circuit
               Court of Richmond from 1852-1869. He along with Richmond
               mayor Joseph Mayo and Judge William Henry Lyons
               surrendered the city to Union forces on April 3, 1865.
               Judge Meredith was also counsel for mayor-elect Henry K.
               Ellyson in the Richmond Mayoralty Case of 1870 and
               witnessed the "Capitol Disaster," the collapse of the
               galleries in the capitol.</p>
          <p>Items pertaining to Judge Meredith include several
               letters, diplomas, a license to practice law and a
               certificate to practice before the Supreme Court. There
               is a pardon signed by President Andrew Johnson as well
               as commissions in the Virginia militia signed by
               governor James McDowell, Littleton Waller Tazewell and
               David Campbell. The collection also includes commissions
               signed by Governor John Letcher and diplomas belonging
               to Judge Meredith's son, William Bernard Meredith
               (1839-1862), as well as miscellaneous materials

          <p>John Preston Cocke is the major figure in the
               collection. He attended Virginia Military Institute in
               1863-64 where, as a cadet, participated in the battle of
               New Market. After the war, he attended both Washington
               College and the University of Virginia. After the latter
               he received a law degree in 1870. That year he moved to
               Richmond to practice law under the guidance of his
               father-in-law, Judge John A. Meredith. The firm of
               Meredith and Cocke was a highly respected one and JPC,
               although seldom appearing in court as an advocate, was
               widely sought for his knowledge of equity and probate
               law. He also served for many years on the vestry of St.
               James Episcopal Church, Richmond.</p>
          <p>This collection deals with the personal affairs and
               not the legal ones of JPC. Personal materials include
               diaries of a trip to England and Scotland, memoranda
               books, correspondence, and a series of biographical
               sketches written by JPC on notable persons buried in
               Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond. Educational materials
               include diplomas and class reports from the University
               of Virginia as well as six class reports from Washington
               College signed by General Robert E. Lee. There is also a
               letter from Woodrow Wilson, thanking JPC for his
               support. Materials for the guardianship of Elizabeth

          <p>The major figure in the Cocke Family Papers is
               Elizabeth Preston Cocke. She was involved in numerous
               civic, religious and benevolent activities in Richmond
               throughout her life and these are documented in the
               collection. She attended Sweet Briar College from
               1909-1912. She was trained as a nurse and in 1913 became
               president of the Girls' Auxiliary of the Instructive
               Visiting Nurses Association. The IVNA sponsored a summer
               camp for underprivileged children from Richmond.
               Although too frail to serve overseas, Elizabeth Preston
               Cocke joined the Army in 1917 as a reconstruction aide
               in Boston. Her work entailed the care and rehabilitation
               of handicapped soldiers. After the war, she was active
               in the organization of children's nurseries and was
               second president of the Richmond Junior League. In this
               capacity she was involved in the restoration of
               Williamsburg, Va. During World War II, Elizabeth Preston
               Cocke was active in Richmond's Volunteer Service Bureau
               in helping to train interviewers to screen and place
               prospective volunteers. She performed the same task for
               Richmond's aircraft filter system, which was part of a
               network of volunteer women that identified and tracked
               all aircraft that flew over the eastern seaboard. She
               was coordinator of the nurse's aid program for McGuire
               Hospital and was also active in overseas relief work
               from 1944-1946. After the war, Elizabeth Preston Cocke
               was active in the United World Federalists movement,
               which was dedicated to international understanding and
               cooperation. She was a life-long member of St. James
               Episcopal Church.</p>
          <p>This collection contains correspondence, reports,
               bulletins, printed materials and clippings concerning
               these activities as well as personal and institutional
               correspondence and diaries detailing travel abroad. Some
               of this correspondence deals with her father's
               participation in the battle of New Market, its
               centennial celebration and its commemoration with a
               bronze plaque in St. James Church. Other correspondents
               include Alexander Wilbourne Weddell, former U. S.
               ambassador to Argentina and Spain, and Dugold Stewart
               Walker, artist and illustrator.</p>
