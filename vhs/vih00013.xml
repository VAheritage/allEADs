      <p>Concern the Hill and related Booton families. Represented
         are Ambrose Powell Hill (1785-1858) of Culpeper County, Va.,
         planter, local official, president of the Thornton's Gap
         Turnpike Company; his son, William Alexander Hill (1817-1890),
         physician and Baptist minister of "Glendalough," Madison
         County, Va.; his sons Hugh Hodge Hill (1858?-1937), physician,
         and Francis Irvin Hill (1860-1946), and daughter, Anna Lee
         (Hill) Major (1847-1935); and grandson, Albert Hudgins Hill
         (1866-1933). The Booton family is represented by John Booton
         (1786-1845), who married Ann Powell Hill (1798?-1872), sister
         of Ambrose Powell Hill above.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers open with a single item of Henry Hill
         (1743-1815), a planter and Continental Army officer who was
         progenitor of the Culpeper Hills. He built "Millwood" on a
         plantation just across the county line in Madison near
         presently-day Novum. The home figured prominently in the
         affairs of his son A. P. Hill.</p>
      <p>Captain Ambrose Powell Hill (1785-1858), uncle of the
         Confederate general of the same name, served as a justice of
         the peace, sheriff and legislator for Culpeper County. He
         lived primarily at Culpeper Court House, but also spent time
         at the home he inherited from his father, "Millwood."</p>
      <p>Captain Hill's correspondence reflects his various
         interests as a planter and local official. It includes letters
         from Congressman John Strode Barbour and Governor William
         Smith. In 1844 Hill was appointed one of the commissioners of
         the Culpeper County Court to consider the construction of a
         bridge spanning the Rapidan River between Culpeper and Orange
         counties. He maintained records as superintendent of the
         building of Germanna Bridge, including orders of the county
         court, specifications, a bond of the contractor, William T. J.
         Richards (in the hand of William Green), and accounts. Hill
         also served as president of the Thornton's Gap Turnpike
         Company, 1850-1854. His records include correspondence and
         reports, minutes, a memorial to the Virginia Board of Public
         Works, specifications for the turnpike and Hazel River Bridge
         in Culpeper County, an account book and loose accounts, and a
         deed (copy) from James Barbour.</p>
      <p>As sheriff and in his private capacity, A. P. Hill also
         acted as executor of a number of estates in Culpeper County.
         His records primarily include correspondence, accounts and
         inventories. One of the estates, that of Mrs. Elizabeth Fry
         (d. 1844), made significant bequests to Baptist organizations
         and institutions. Hill's personal miscellany includes as well
         records of his activities as a member of Mount Pony (later
         Culpeper) Baptist Church. Estate materials, kept by his son
         and administrator, William A. Hill, include a conveyance of
         "Millwood," division of slaves, and records of two lawsuits
         concerning the estate settlement.</p>
      <p>John Booton (1786-1845) was a son of William Booton and
         Frances Hill, a sister of Henry Hill (1743-1815). Booton lived
         at "chestnut Grove" in Madison County and his family attended
         Liberty Baptist Church, just across the line in Greene County.
         He pursued an active, if erratic, career in local affairs. His
         correspondence includes letters of Madison clerk Belfield Cave
         (concerning a contested election in 1841; see below) and
         lawyer William Green. A large group of loose accounts covers
         the purchase and sale of tobacco and wheat, subscriptions to
         Baptist publications, and, like almost all groups of accounts
         in this collection, local taxation. John Booton and his broth
         Sinclair also had a financial interest in John S. Beazley
         &amp; Co., merchants in Rapid Ann (now Wolftown), Va.</p>
      <p>As well as planting, Booton acted as deputy sheriff in
         Madison under a succession of sheriffs, including William
         Booton and Robert Thomas. His tenure covered the years
         1815-1843, during part of which time his brother Sinclair also
         served as deputy sheriff. Booton's records include auditor's
         receipts; receipts from the Madison county commissioner of the
         revenue; Sheriff's receipts (including fees for "farmage" -
         the leasing of the office of sheriff to a deputy in return for
         a portion of collected fees); executives of judgments, orders
         and writs issued by the county court or individual justices; a
         bond of the jailor concerning the county jail; fee book, 1828;
         and records as administrator of estates in Madison County
         (primarily accounts and inventories), committed to the
         sheriffs by the county court.</p>
      <p>Records of land purchased or sold by John Booton in Madison
         and Orange counties include deeds, agreements, receipts,
         surveys and plats. Other materials include judgments issued in
         1837 as a justice of the peace, and records as clerk of the
         lst and 2nd Battalions of the 82nd Infantry Regiment of
         Virginia Militia (primarily fines for failing to attend
         muster) Booton was twice elected to the House of Delegates for
         Madison County (1839 and 1840) and both times his election was
         successfully contested by opponent Robert Alexander Banks. The
         latter investigation created a tense situation in the county
         (see Belfield Cave letters; House Journal, 1840-1841, Doc. No.
         45, and election materials in this collection).</p>
      <p>John Booton acted as trustee for his cousin Henry Hill
         (1782-1846) and brother-in-law William Henry Hill (1803-1880),
         and as administrator of the estate of his brother Sinclair
         (1797-1839). Among his miscellaneous records are slave
         materials and 1830 agreement concerning a copper mine in
         Orange County. Estate materials, kept by executors Edwin
         Booton and William A. Hill, include inventories and
         appraisals, loose accounts, sales and tax records, an account
         book covering the guardianship of Ann Powell Hill Booton (b.
         1827), and records of the division of "Chestnut Grove" after
         the death of Booton's wife.</p>
      <p>Captain A. P. Hill's son, William Alexander Hill
         (1817-1890), was both a physician and a Baptist minister. He
         built and lived at "Glendalough" near Locust Dale in Madison
         County. His correspondence consists primarily of family
         letters, including a number from his sons while they served in
         the Confederate Army and to his daughter describing military
         operations in and around Culpeper and Madison counties. Other
         correspondents include Governor William Smith and General
         James Gaven Field, later attorney-general of Virginia;
         additional subjects include financial matters and Baptist
         church affairs.</p>
      <p>Dr. Hill was educated at the University of Pennsylvania in
         Philadelphia. His records include class cards issued to attend
         medial lectures. Hill served as executor of Oliver B. Jenks, a
         New Hampshire-born physician who practiced in Madison and
         married one of Hill's Twyman cousins. The records include an
         account book, loose accounts, 1858-1875 (primarily for medical
         services rendered), receipts and bonds. Hill also served as
         administrator of several other estates in Madison, including
         that of Baptist benefactor Daniel J. Smoot. Miscellaneous
         items include materials concerning Hill's pastorates at
         Liberty Church in Greene County and Antioch Church, a black
         congregation at Culpeper Court House, as well as records as
         first superintendent of schools in Madison and Greene
         counties. Dr. Hill's wife, Judith Frances (Booton) Hill (1822-
         1909), was a daughter of John Booton. Her correspondence
         consists primarily of family letters, though a number concern
         the death of William A. Hill. Thomas Hill (b. 1810?) was a
         brother of William A. Hill. A few items of financial interest
         comprise his papers in Box 9.</p>
      <p>Edwin Booton (b. 1820) and John Booton (b. 1825) both moved
         to Greene County. Some of their accounts were generated as
         agents for their month, Ann Powell (hill) Booton. Their
         unmarried sister, Ann Powell Hill Booton (b. 1827) lived at
         "Chestnut Grove" and later at "Glendalough". Her papers
         consist primarily of family correspondence (especially with
         nephew Hugh Hodge Hill), guardian's accounts kept by William
         A. Hill, 1847-1862, and loose financial records.</p>
      <p>John Booton Hill (1841-1913), son of Dr. William A. Hill,
         worked for his uncle Henry Hill (1816-1866) as a paymaster for
         the U. S. Army preceding the Civil War. In 1861 he returned to
         Madison as Captain of Co. C of the 82nd Regiment of Militia.
         He was soon transferred to Richmond, again to assist his uncle
         in creating the paymaster department for Virginia State Forces
         and later for the Confederate Army. In 1864 he rose to the
         rank of Major and was assigned to Anderson's Corps of the Army
         of Norther Virginia at the Siege of Petersburg. After the War
         he worked as assistant superintendent of the Richmond Water
         Works and as treasurer of the E. B. Taylor Co., importers, and
         was active in First Baptist Church.</p>
      <p>Hill's papers include letters, mostly written to his sister
         Anna while in Confederate service (see also his parents'
         correspondence); reminiscences of service; obituary notices
         and memorials; and a few items of his wife, Virginia Byrd
         (Hudgins) Hill (1842-1925), including notes on the Hudgins
         family.</p>
      <p>Hill's brother William Powell Hill (1844-1929) also served
         in the Quartermaster's Department of the Confederate Army and
         later in Co. C of the 4th Virginia Cavalry Regiment. After the
         War he engaged in lumber manufacturing in Orange County and
         handled real estate in Culpeper County. Letters to his sister
         Anna during his Confederate service chiefly comprise his
         correspondence (see also his parents' correspondence), while
         two commonplace books concern agricultural labor and activity
         and a diary of a trip from "Glendalough" to Luray, Va.,
         presumably in 1867.</p>
      <p>Dr. Hugh Hodge Hill (1858-?1937) was named for one of his
         father's medical professors at the University of Pennsylvania.
         He attended the same school and then practiced in Madison
         County and as resident physician at Mountain Lake Hotel in
         Giles County. Among his papers are reports, essays, and
         exercises while a student at Locust Dale Academy, Locust Dale,
         Va. (1873-1876); materials concerning his attempt to secure a
         post as resident physician at Germantown Hospital, Germantown,
         Pa., in 1896; and some records of his activity in Mt. Zion
         Baptist Church, Oakpark, Va.</p>
      <p>Youngest of the Hill brothers, Francis Irvin Hill
         (1860-1946) lived for a time in Greensboro, N. C., as an
         insurance agent and later a manufacturer's representative, but
         seems to have returned to "Glendalough" in the 1890s. He kept
         a diary of farm and local events in early 1899 (entries after
         March 29 were made by his wife, Zilpha), and his accounts are
         very sporadic except for the years 1935-1945. Miscellany
         includes about a half-dozen letters written to Zilpha Hill
         (Brachin) Hill (d. 1906).</p>
      <p>Philip Major (b. 1847) married Dr. William A. Hill's eldest
         daughter. He was a "professor" at Locust Dale Academy and
         lived at"Glendalough". His wife Anna Lee (Hill) Major
         (1847-1935), attended school at the Inglewood Female Academy
         run by Dr. Charles Quarles at "Inglewood" in Louisa County
         during the Civil War. Much of her correspondence is with
         family members, schoolmates, and fellow workers in the Baptist
         Church. Correspondents include James Gaven Field and Baptist
         ministers Samuel Cornelius Clopton, Oscar Farish Flippo (with
         photograph), and William Alexander Street.</p>
      <p>Julia Henry Hill (1853?-1888) appears in the correspondence
         of her parents and older siblings. Among her papers is an
         agreement with the Locust Dale School District in Madison
         County to teach at Oak Park School House in 1877, and
         resolutions of the Mt. Zion Baptist Church Women's Missionary
         Society.</p>
      <p>Albert Hudgins Hill (1866-1933), son of John Booton Hill,
         attended the University of Richmond and began his teaching
         career in a local evening school. His correspondence includes
         letters from William Gordon McCabe. He became principal of
         Scottsville Elementary and High Schools in 1887. Materials
         include recommendations, a certificate, and a news clipping.
         Hill joined the Richmond City public schools in 1889, rising
         from principal to assistant superintendent in 1904 and
         superintendent in 1919. Materials, 1909-1933, consist of
         correspondence, accounts, an abortive nomination as
         superintendent in 1909, records of attendance at Colombia
         University, 1911-1914, appointment as superintendent,
         biographical information, essays, news clippings, and
         resolutions.</p>
      <p>Albert Hill married Cora J. Bransford (1867-1941) of
         Lynchburg. Along with family correspondence and loose
         accounts, the collection also contains records of her
         administration of the estate of her sister, Judith H.
         (Bransford) Silverhorn; a commonplace book, 1913-1936,
         including notes of deaths of members of the Beers and
         Bransford families; and an autograph album kept in Lynchburg,
         1881-1893. Mrs. Hill's estate materials consist primarily of
         sympathy notes and letters written to her daughters, Katharine
         Byrd (Hill) Smith and Judith Bransford (Hill) Weaver.</p>
      <p>The last section of the collection consists of miscellany,
         including a few items of general correspondence of various
         other members of the Booton and Hill families, 1866-1905;
         accounts, 1838-1865; obituary notices; clippings, and an
         agreement of Governor James Lawson Kemper with Alfred Madison
         Barbour concerning land in Culpeper County.</p>
