      <p>William Gray was a prominent tobacco shipper and
         manufacturer associated with several firms in Manchester, Va.
         Born in Prince Edward County, Gray moved to Manchester (part
         of Chesterfield County incorporated into the city of Richmond
         in 1910), around 1810. In 1821, Gray became a partner in Gray
         &amp; Pankey and, twelve years later, established his own
         firm, Willima Gray &amp; Co. He directed the company's
         operations until his death in 1863.</p>

    <scopecontent>
      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Letters received by William Gray &amp; Co. are typical of
         those written by factors; they acknowledge the receipt of
         tobacco shipments and of drafts on account and give the
         general market conditions as well as the status of the
         manufacturer's brands. Many 1837 letters, especially those of
         Cornelius DuBois &amp; Co., describe the financial panic of
         that year. A letter from D. W. Kennedy of the Northern Bank of
         Tennessee on 2 February 1858 describes the murder of Gray's
         partner, Joseph H. Harris, and subsequent lynching of the
         accused slave. An 1859 letter from the New York firm of
         Sawyer, Wallace &amp; Co. discusses northern reaction to the
         capture and execution of John Brown.</p>
      <p>Through the Gilliat houses of London and Liverpool, Gray's
         tobacco reached markets in continental Europe and Africa.
         Because of this, Gilliat's letters often discuss the
         international climate and its effect on the tobacco market.
         These letters are especially noteworthy during the 1861-1863
         period, when they give a good assessment of English merchant
         opinion and reaction to secession, Lincoln's call for troops,
         the blockade, and the Trent Affair. Occasionally, personal
         letters appear among this correspondence; in 1858, for
         example, Algernon Gilliat toured the United States and wrote
         Gray concerning his observations and reactions.</p>
      <p>A 1 Jan. 1868 letter from Methodist minister James A.
         Riddick concerns Reconstruction and the Underwood convention.
         Another from Methodist minister, William B. Rowzie, describes
         conditions in Danville in the final days of the Civil War.</p>
      <p>In 1821, William Gray entered into partnership with his
         brother, James Gray, and Loring Young Pankey, in operating a
         tobacco shipping and manufacturing firm under the name Gray
         &amp; Pankey. The company's papers, filed in box 7, include
         letters, accounts, and miscellany. Several accounts pertain to
         the purchase of cotton. Miscellany includes shipping
         agreements and a power of attorney.</p>
      <p>The papers of William Gray &amp; Co., which constitute the
         bulk of this collection, consist of letters, accounts, checks,
         tobacco circulars, prices-current and cash and tobacco receipt
         books. Letters, which are arranged alphabetically by year, are
         primarily from northern and European tobacco agents (or
         "factors"). Major factors include: William H. Gilliat and its
         successor John K. Gilliat &amp; Co. (London and Liverpool),
         Cornelius DuBois &amp; Co. (New York), and John Wilson &amp;
         Co. (New York). A more extensive, although by no means
         complete, index of Gray's correspondents appears below.
         Although primarily a shipper of tobacco, Gray was involved at
         various times in its manufacture, and there are some letters
         addressed to Samuel Hardgrove &amp; Co., a manufacturing firm,
         during the 1837-1844 period. In 1856, Gray went into
         partnership with Joseph H. Harris to establish a tobacco
         stemmery in New Providence, Tennessee. Although Harris was
         killed two years later, Gray retained his ties to New
         Providence. There are letters addressed to Joseph H. Harris
         for the years 1856 to 1858.</p>
      <p>Financial records (boxes 14-18) include both accounts
         receivable from tobacco purchasers and accounts payable for
         tobacco and factory expenses. These are arranged
         chronologically. Cash books list deposits and withdrawals from
         the Bank of Virginia, 1845-1853, and the National Exchange
         Bank, 1865-1868. The tobacco receipt books of Joseph H. Harris
         &amp; Co. contain only several entries and are undated,
         although they would be from the 1856-1858 period. Listings of
         prices-current, mostly from Liverpool, Mobile and New Orleans,
         contain market information on tobacco and other commodities,
         particularly cotton. Circulars are mostly from Liverpool and
         New York and pertain primarily to tobacco and cotton.</p>
      <p>The folder of miscellany (box 21) contains several items of
         note. These include: an 1825 petition to establish a boarding
         house in Manchester, an 1834 order to Richmond's City
         Sergeant, a bill of complaint for Howard &amp; Lawrence v.
         Winchester's executors, an insurance policy and financial
         statements of the Mutual Assurance Society of Virginia, report
         cards for two of Gray's children from Randolph-Macon College
         (1859- 1861 and 1870-1871), and an order to E. H. Ripley from
         Richmond Provost Marshal Frederick L. Manning (USA) on April
         3, 1865.</p>
