         correspondence, 1918- 1982, chiefly with family; account
         books, 1951-1980, concerning farming operations; accounts,
         1919-1982; checks and bank statements; and materials

         Foundation. Papers of Anna Garnett Gwathmey (1879-1979),
         insurance agent, include correspondence, 1913-1975, with
         family; account books, accounts, and bank records, 1916-1979;
         and business records, 1921-1970, documenting her career in New

      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>This collection represents four generations of this
         prominent King William County family. From their family seat
         at "Burlington," the Gwathmey's were active in the political,
         social, and religious life of the county for more than two
         centuries.</p>
      <p>Joseph Hardin Gwathmey and his wife, Jeannette Garnett
         (Ryland) Gwathmey, had five children, three of whom, John
         Ryland Gwathmey (1888-1982), Anna Garnett Gwathmey
         (1879-1979), and Mary Burnley Gwathmey (1883- 1974), are
         prominent in this collection.</p>
      <p>With the exception of the years he spent at Virginia
         Polytechnic Institute (Now Virginia Polytechnic University and
         State University), John Ryland Gwathmey spent his entire life
         at "Burlington." John Ryland Gwathmey supervised farming and
         timber operations on the family estate and appraised real
         estate in King William and nearby counties. He was also a
         member of the county board of supervisors and of Beulah
         Baptist Church.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent>
      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection begins with the papers of Joseph Gwathmey,
         (1758-1824), a planter, major in the state militia, and deacon
         of the Beulah Baptist Church. These records consist of an
         account book, loose accounts, and estate materials. Major
         Gwathmey's account book also contains records of his
         children's births and lists of horses. Most of his papers,
         however, concern his estate and include the records of
         executors, Richard Gwathmey (1789-1866), John Hill Gwathmey
         (1798-1839), and William Gwathmey (1794-1875). Two accounts
         books contain copies of Joseph Gwathmey's will, inventories,
         appraisals, and accounts and expenses. Loose estate materials
         include accounts, inventories, an indenture selling land to
         Nathaniel Boush Hill, and an 1836 appraisal of slaves.</p>
      <p>The papers of William Gwathmey are found in boxes 2-7.
         William Gwathmey inherited "Wakefield," but moved to
         "Burlington" upon the death of his brother, John Hill
         Gwathmey, in 1839. A planter and physician, Gwathmey was also
         a trustee of the Beulah Baptist Church.</p>
      <p>Dr. Gwathmey's papers begin with a diary of his journey to
         St. Augustine, Florida, with his wife and sister-in-law,
         Hardinia M. Burnley, from 1833 to 1834. Other diaries follow;
         a complete list of these appears in the guide that follows
         this description. The diaries, many of which are kept in
         copies of Richardson's Almanac, mostly concern weather
         conditions, farming operations, the health of slaves,
         physicians's visits, and church activities. The pages of an
         1837 diary describe a trip to New Orleans and southwest
         Louisiana. Entries in the 1852 diary concern a medical
         conference in Richmond (Apr. 28, May 5) and the presidential
         election of that year (Nov. 9). The 1859 diary describes
         hiring day in Ayletts (Jan. 1) and election day (May 26).</p>
      <p>Diaries from the Civil War years not only provide
         Gwathmey's views on the war, but also document local events.
         Several 1863 entries describe the appearance of Northern units
         in King William (January 8 and June 5), as well as the baptism
         of slaves at Beulah (Sept. 6). Entries for 1864 describe the
         arrival of Union troops at Ayletts (Mar. 1-2), the doctoring
         of wounded soldiers, and the occupation of "Burlington" (May
         22- 29). Several 1866 entries concern Reconstruction (Feb. 27,
         May 31, June 12-18). These last entries concern formal charges
         bought against a neighbor for mistreating a former slave.</p>
      <p>Boxes 3-5 contain the correspondence of William Gwathmey.
         Most of this consists of letters from family members,
         including Joseph Robert Garlick, Frances Fielding (Lewis)
         Gwathmey, Lucy Ann (Garlick) Gwathmey, Richard Gwathmey,
         Washington Gwathmey, and William Henry Gwathmey. Many of these
         letters concern the activities of Beulah Church. Significant
         correspondence incudes the letters of Gwathmey's
         brother-in-law, Edwin Burnley, who apparently deserted his
         wife and went to Mississippi. These letters document his
         divorce and attempts to transfer slaves to his new home. The
         letters of another brother-in-law, Dr. Thomas Meaux, concern
         medicine and phyhsicians. Thomas Witt Haynes writes concerning
         WG's son Richard Brooke Gwathmeyh, who served in the 9th
         Virginia Cavalry during the Civil War. Letters with Alexander
         Fleet pertain to Gwathmey's brief service in the Ware of 1812,
         for which WG was applying for a pension. An 1865 letter from
         richard Gwathmey describes the Richmond fire, while an 1837
         letter describes a trip to Chicago, Ill.</p>
      <p>Three accounts books follow. The first two are indexed and
         primarily consist of accounts with patients, but they also
         include records of family births, servant births, lists of
         livestock, and accounts with the estate of Joseph Gwathmey.
         The second account book also contains accounts, 1875-1895, of
         Joseph Hardin Gwathmey. The third account book, 1870-1875,
         contains contracts and accounts with farm hands.</p>
      <p>Loose accounts begin in box 7. These are followed by deeds
         and bonds, most of which concern land, but which also include
         an indenture to a former slave, Sylvia Hill, granting her
         ownership of her house. Beulah Baptist Church records consist
         of lists of subscriptions, a commonplace book, eulogies for
         Hardin Burnley (1804?-1869), John William Garlick
         (1823?-1866), Edward Hill (d. 1870) and James Trice.
         Miscellaneous materials include photocopies concerning
         Gwathmey's 1812 service and a pass, 1864, signed by James
         Alexander Seddon (1815-1880).</p>
      <p>The correspondence of Elizabeth Theresa (Burnley) Gwathmey
         (1806-1879), wife of William Gwathmey, consists mostly of
         letters written by her children. Among those are the letters
         of Mary Atwood Gwathmey, which describe her visit to cousins
         in Mississippi in 1856 and 1857.</p>
      <p>The collection contains materials of seven of William and
         Elizabeth (Burnley) Gwathmey's children. The papers of Richard
         Brooke Gwathmey (1838-1864), a soldier in the 9th Virginia
         Cavalry during the Civil War, and William Gwathmey (1840-1858)
         are located in box 8. Also in box 8 are several diaries of
         Joseph Hardin Gwathmey (1846-1918), who inherited "Burlington"
         upon the death of his father in 1875. Gwathmey, an agent for
         the Virginia Fire and Marine Insurance Company, also served as
         superintendent of King William County Schools.</p>
      <p>Gwathmey's general correspondence is mostly with friends
         and family members, but also includes a letter signed by
         Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1881-1944), as Assistant Secretary
         of the Navy, thanking Gwathmey for the loan of his binoculars
         to the U. S. Navy during the First World War. Account books
         concern farming operations and include accounts with far
         laborers. Loose accounts include receipts from the King
         William County Grange. Records concerning Gwathmey's
         superintendency of King William schools consist mostly of
         certificates, but also include a statistical report, ca. 1905,
         detailing conditions in the system.</p>
      <p>The papers of Jeannette Garnett (Ryland) Gwathmey
         (1847-1915), wife of Joseph Hardin Gwathmey, consist of
         diaries, memoranda and scrapbooks, correspondence, and
         miscellany. The diaries mostly concern the weather and her
         church activities, but the 1905 volume also contains notes on
         the Garnett family. Her memoranda book contains notes on the
         Peachey, Ryland, and Griffin families.</p>
      <p>The papers of Owen Overton Gwathmey (1849-1922), Elizabeth
         Burnley Gwathmey (b. 1818), Hardinia Morris Gwathmey
         (1832-1905), and Mary Atwood Gwathmey (1834-1868) are located
         in boxes 11 and 12. Owen Overton Gwathmey was a lawyer and
         judge of the King William Circuit Court. Among his papers are
         deeds of land to Gwathmey in his capacity as trustee for
         Beulah Baptist Church. His miscellany includes the wills of
         Sylvia Hill (d. 1906) and Phillis Garlick, both of King
         William County.</p>
      <p>Gwathmey's papers begin with general correspondence, which
         is mostly with family members. Frequent correspondents include
         his sisters, Anna Garnett Gwathmey and Mary Burnley Gwathmey,
         Eleanor Gwathmey (Powell) Dewey, Joseph Hardin Gwathmey
         (1878-1945), Laura (Blankenship) Albert Gwathmey, and Lewis
         Franklin Powell, associate justice of the United States
         Supreme Court. Many of Powell's letters concern the
         Burlington- Gwathmey Memorial Foundation, but have been filed
         together with the general correspondence. Form letters consist
         mostly of appeals from charitable and political organizations.
         Greeting cards and invitations conclude this box.</p>
      <p>Box 17 contains account books. Three of these concern
         farming operations at "Burlington." Financial records consist
         almost entirely of bank statements and federal income and
         property tax returns. Other financial records relate to life
         and health insurance and trust funds, including statements and
         accounts of the Burlington Cemetery Trust Fund.</p>
      <p>In the late 1970's, "Burlington" was added to the Virginia
         Landmarks Register. Correspondence with the Virginia Historic
         Landmarks Commission concerns the establishment of landmark
         status, the granting of an open space easement, and the
         awarding of a preservation grant and subsequent restoration.
         In 1977, the Burlington-Gwathmey Memorial Foundation was
         established to maintain the family estate after the death of
         John Ryland Gwathmey. Foundation materials include acts of
         incorporation and correspondence, primarily with lawyers.</p>
      <p>Box 30 begins with letters and census reports from the
         Department of Agriculture concerning farming operations at
         "Burlington." Materials pertaining to timber include reports,
         agreement, and accounts with lumber mills. These are followed
         by land records, mostly deeds of lease, concerning other land
         owned by JRG, including a house in Ayletts known as
         "Gwathmey's," and "Meadow Farm," the estate adjacent to
         "Burlington."</p>
      <p>John Ryland Gwathmey served as chairman of the industrial
         and Rural Utilities Committee of the Ruritan Club of King
         William County. These papers mostly concern the publication of
         a promotional pamphlet, King William Invites You, and consist
         of correspondence and drafts of the manuscript. Materials from
         JRG's tenure as a member of the county's board of supervisors
         also primarily concern industrial growth and include a
         consultant's 1970 water and sewerage report. Appraisals of
         farms in King William and surrounding counties, conducted by
         JRG, conclude box 31. Papers relating to JRG's service as
         trustee and clerk of the Beulah Baptist Church concern
         subscriptions and renovations to the building. These precede
         student composition books, clippings, and miscellany.</p>
      <p>The papers of Anna Garnett Gwathmey begin with general
         correspondence (boxes 33-36). Much of this is with her sister,
         Mary Burnley Gwathmey, from 1921-1926. Other frequent
         correspondents include family members: Alice R. Campbell,
         Jeannette O. Campbell, Joseph Hardin Gwathmey (1878-1945),
