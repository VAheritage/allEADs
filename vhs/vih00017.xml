      <p>The Wickham family of Richmond and Hanover County, known as
         the "Hickory Hill Wickhams," was founded by the celebrated
         post-Revolutionary attorney John Wickham (1763-1839). This
         collection traces the descendants of Wickham and his first
         wife, Mary Smith Fanning, through the line of his eldest son,
         William Fanning Wickham.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent>
      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection opens with materials of William Fanning
         (1728-1782) of Brunswick and Greensville counties, Va., an
         Anglican clergyman who was both an uncle of John Wickham and
         father of Wickham's first wife. Included are a certificate of
         ordination, 1754, issued to Fanning as a deacon in the Church
         of England (signed by the Bishop of Gloucester and bearing a
         seal of the Bishop of London); a 1781 letter of Fanning to
         Virginia Governor Thomas Nelson (a copy made in 1857)
         concerning John Wickham; and a will probated in Greensville
         County. Early folders also contain notes on the Fanning, Gray,
         Tazewell, and Wickham families (apparently taken from the
         family Bible of Mary (Gray) Tazewell Fanning); and
         correspondence, 1930, of Henry Taylor Wickham with George
         MacLaren Brydon concerning William and Edmund Fanning.</p>
      <p>Series 2 contains papers of Edmund Fanning (1739-1818),
         another of Wickham's uncles who took a particular interest in
         the younger man's education and career. Edmund Fanning pursued
         his own colorful career in colonial administration and
         eventually served as governor of Nova Scotia. His records in
         this collection include correspondence, 1738-ca. 1812, with
         Sir Robert Pigot, John Wickham (concerning Wickham's service
         in the King's American Regiment and as a lawyer in Richmond,
         Va.), and Mary Smith (Fanning) Wickham; letters, 1777-1778
         (copies made in 1873) of Fanning (while serving in the King's
         American Regiment) to James Fanning and Hannah Smith (Fanning)
         Wickham (concerning John Wickham); a prayer, ca. 1788, for the
         governor, council, and assembly of Prince Edward Island,
         Canada; and biographical sketches, ca. 1800-1829.</p>
      <p>Series 3 contains a limited number of John Wickham's own
         personal records survive in Box 1 of this collection. Letters,
         1806, written to Philadelphia merchant David Parish concern
         the personal and financial affairs of entrepreneur David Ross;
         while letters, 1778-1799 (copies of which were made in
         1873-1874) written to John Wickham (1734-1808) and Harriet
         Smith (Fanning) Wickham, John Wickham's parents, describe his
         travels in Europe and practice of law in Richmond, Va.</p>
      <p>John Wickham's land records, 1801-1842, primarily concern
         plantations in Henrico and Goochland counties known as "Middle
         Quarter," "Lower Quarter," and "Ellerslie" and are related to
         his acquisition of the "East Tuckahoe" plantation. These
         papers consist of proceedings, exhibits, decrees, and other
         records from the lawsuit of Wakelyn Welch, surviving partner
         of Robert Cary and Company of London v. the executors of
         Thomas Mann Randolph (a British debt case that concerns in
         part the sale of "Middle Quarter Plantation" and its Negro
         slaves to Wickham in 1800) signed by George Wythe and bearing
         a seal of the Virginia High Court of Chancery; a deed of
         trust, 1838, of Wickham to BenjaminWatkins Leigh and William
         Fanning Wickham for the benefit of John Wickham's children
         (deed covers slaves, cattle, horses, and personal property on
         the plantation); and a newspaper notice, 1842, of the public
         auction of these lands.</p>
      <p>Wickham's miscellany contains a commission, 1782, in the
         King's American Regiment of Foot (signed by George III and
         Thomas Townshend, Viscount Sydney, and bears seal); an
         argument, 1795, of John Wickham (through not in his hand) as
         counsel for the U.S. in the U.S. Circuit Court at Richmond in
         U.S. v. Daniel Lawrence Hylton (concerning the
         constitutionality of the federal carriage tax); a deed of
         trust (copy), 1800 to shares in the Bank of Baltimore for the
         benefit of Mary (Gray) Tazewell Fanning; a statement, ca.
         1820, of the case of John Ponsonby Martin concerning the
         confiscation of the Virginia estate of John Martin by the
         Commonwealth of Virginia in 1779; a student notebook, n.d.,
         used (probably by one of Wickham's children) to practice
         handwriting; lines of verse, 1835, copied from the Southern
         Literary Messenger concerning Wickham's speech before the
         Virginia House of Delegates; and drafts of a biographical
         sketch, 1887, by Williams Carter Wickham.</p>
      <p>The next three boxes (Boxes 2-4) cover the very extensive
         and complicated proceedings over the estate of John Wickham.
         Due to a number of technicalities, Wickham's estate matters
         eventually absorbed the estates of Richmond physician James
         McClurg, his father-in-law, and of several of his children who
         died young, and gave rise to an enormous amount of
         litigation.</p>
      <p>The estate records begin with two copies of Wickham's
         lengthy will, 1839, probated in Richmond. Correspondence,
         1852-1875, of William Fanning Wickham (as surviving executor
         with Benjamin Watkins Leigh) including numerous letters from
         Julia (Wickham) Leigh (concerning family affairs and the U.S.
         Customs House in Richmond), John Wickham (1825-1892) of St.
         Louis, Mo., and John Wickham (1825-1902) of "East Tuckahoe,"
         Henrico County , Va. An account book, 1856-1880, kept by
         William Fanning Wickham bears frequent notes on transactions
         and financial affairs of the estate and on his trusteeship for
         a younger Wickham daughter, Frances (Wickham) Graham. Loose
         accounts cover the period 1848-1863; bonds, 1853-1869.
         Materials concerning land of John Wickham in Kentucky and
         Missouri and of Doctor McClurg in Randolph County [W.Va.] and
         in Kentucky (Folder 5) include correspondence with Joseph
         Rogers Underwood and others and notes of William Fanning
         Wickham. Estate miscellany consists of a petition to and order
         of the Richmond Circuit Court in 1864; materials, 1858,
         concerning Amy (a Negro slave) at Eastern Lunatic Asylum
         (later Eastern State Hospital) in Williamsburg, Va., and notes
         of William Fanning Wickham.Box 4 contains records of a trust
         established by the estate for a granddaughter of John Wickham,
         Charlotte Georgiana Wickham, upon her marriage in 1859 to
         William Henry Fitzhugh Lee. William Fanning Wickham and Robert
         E. Lee served as trustees. Materials include the deed of trust
         (marriage settlement) establishing the trust, signed by all
         the above parties plus Williams Carter (grandfather of the
         bride and her guardian); notes and memoranda of William
         Fanning Wickham, 1858-1868; and an order and receipt,
         1866-1868, of William Henry Fitzhugh Lee concerning shares of
         Virginia 6% state stock (also signed by Robert E. Lee).</p>
      <p>Correspondence of William Fanning Wickham as trustee
         includes numerous communications with Doctor Charles Carter,
         Robert E. Lee, and William Henry Fitzhugh Lee (of "Arlington,"
         "Ravensworth," Fairfax County, and "White House," New Kent
         County). Two bank books and some loose accounts cover the
         period 1854-1867. Materials, 1856-1879, concern lot #502 at
         Grace and Sixth streets in Richmond and #533 at Broad and
         Sixth streets, owned respectively by Maclurg Wickham and W. H.
         F. Lee in the division of the estate of Doctor James McClurg.
         Another group of records, 1861, concern the lot and tenanment
         on Cary Street adjoining the Bank of Richmond, A deed of
         release (copy), 1867, of W. H. F. Lee conveys land in Warwick

         Foushee. Lastly, materials, 1880-1882, concern a lawsuit in
         Richmond Chancery Court of William Henry Fitzhugh Lee v.
         William Carter Wickham (executor of William Fanning Wickham)
         etal. (including correspondence of Wickham and Lee, an answer
         of Wickham, exhibits, receipts, and notes).</p>
      <p>Series 4, containing the personal records of William
         Fanning Wickham (1793-1880) commences with Box 5. A prominent
         attorney of early Richmond like his father, William Fanning
         Wickham retired early to his plantation in Hanover County,
         "Hickory Hill," and devoted the rest of his life to his family
         and to agriculture. He kept a long series of diaries (17
         volumes) beginning in 1828, in which he recorded little of a
         personal nature but much on agricultural operations. weather,
         the sale of produce, plantation life, horse breeding, and
         local affairs. Many of the diaries include lists of Negro
         slaves (with their ages) at"Hickory Hill" and adjoining
         plantations, as well as records of slave births and deaths.
         Some volumes include plats of fields (beginning with volume
         5). Volume 8 covers the Hanover County homefront during the
         Civil War, describing the treatment of slaves and noting
         runaways to the Union Army. It mentions a battle near "Hickory
         Hill" on 27 May 1862 (entry for 31 May), news of campaigns and
         Union raids during the summers of 1862 and 1863, and reports
         on the Spotsylvania Campaign, 14-31 May 1864. Volume XIV
         reports the devastating fire at "Hickory Hill" on 13 February
         1875.Wickham's general correspondence covers the period
         1817-1878 and is generally maintained with family members.
         Letters to Anne Butler (Carter) Wickham and William Carter
         Wickham mostly concern the elder Wickham's trip to Europe in
         1852 (visiting Geneva, London, Paris, and Rome). Other
         correspondents include Doctor Charles Carter of Philadelphia
         (largely concerning the estate of Williams Carter, and "North
         Wales," in Caroline County, letters dated 1865 concern the
         postwar crisis in Virginia), Edmund Fontaine (concerning train
         stops on the Virginia Central Railroad in Hanover County),
         William Cabell Rives, Judith Page (Walker) Rives (concerning
         the death of William Cabell Rives), Littleton Waller Tazewell
         (imperfect), James Maclurg Wikcham (concerning the death of
         George Wickham) and Lucy Penn (Taylor) Wickham. Letters of
         condolence, sent to William Fanning Wickham upon the death of
         Anne Butler (Carter) Wickham in 1868, also include
         acknowledgements by Wickham (especially to Robert E. Lee) and
         other members of the Carter and Wickham families, and a prayer
         by Wickham.</p>
      <p>Wickham's financial records in Box 7 include accounts,
         1828-1841, 1854-1863, and 1872-1878; a memoranda book of
         stocks, 1853-1861; bonds, 1878, of Wickham to John Henry

         plantation and adjoining acreage between 1828 and 1878 which
         totaled nearly 3500 acres by the latter date. An 1878 survey
         report, title history, and map give an overview of the gradual
         evolution of the plantation. Folder 1 contains deeds,
         1820-1828, of the heirs of George William Smith to William

      <p>One of the most interesting matters handled by William
         Fanning Wickham as an attorney concerned the estate of Samuel
         Gist (d. 1815), a London merchant. Gist lived in Virginia for
         a number of years but returned to England before the American
         Revolution. During that conflict, the Commonwealth of Virginia
         sought to confiscate his lands and goods but the General
         Assembly was prevailed upon to enact legislation in 1782
         vesting his property in the hands of a daughter Mary (Gist)
         Anderson Pearkes and her first husband, William Anderson. Gist
         continued to receive the profits from his estates after the
         war through his manager in Hanover County, Benjamin Toler, and
         by his will sought to emancipate his slaves and provide for
         their welfare through the sale of property in Goochland
         County. An act of Assembly in 1816 created a trust supervised
         by the Superior Court of Chancery in Richmond to be
         administered until all creditors of the estate were satisfied,
         when funds could be generated from the sale of land and other
         property to benefit the freed slaves, who in turn had to leave
         the Commonwealth. William Fanning Wickham acted as one of the
         trustees from 1817 until 1847 and in 1858-1859 heard from
         members of the Quaker committee devoted to the care of free
         blacks in Ohio, where Gist's slaves finally settled. The whole
         issue was raised again in 1877-1880 by E. Cumberland, one of
         the original freedmen who moved to Ohio and settled on lands
         purchased through funds from the estate but which the blacks
         had no right to alienate themselves.</p>
      <p>Materials from the Gist estate include correspondence of
         William Fanning Wickham as surviving trustee with agents,
         attorneys, former slaves, and Quakers in Ohio (especially
         David Bailey, a former resident of Petersburg, and George
         Carter) during three periods: 1845-1849 (closing the Virginia
         affairs of the trust), 1850-1858 (reports from Ohio Friends),
         and 1870-1880 (the re-establishment of extended claims by
         former Gist slaves and their descendants). General materials
         include loose accounts, 1826-1853; bonds, 1819; records,
         1832-1847, concerning the acquisition of lands in Brown and
         Highland counties, Ohio, and the maintenance of former slaves;
         and a letter (copy) of John Wickham (1763-1839) to John
         Hampden Pleasants concerning his role as one of the original
         trustees.</p>
      <p>Records from supervision of the Gist estate by the Virginia
         Superior Court of Chancery in Richmond (later the Circuit
         Superior Court of Chancery) include memorials to the court,
         decrees, orders, etc., 1845- 1847, and a long series of
         commissioner's reports, 1818-1847. Records of the case
         Archibald Anderson etal. v. Samuel Gist's executors etal.,
         heard by Chief Justice John Marshall in the Fifth U.S. Circuit
         Court for the Virginia District in Richmond (concerning claims
         under the will of William Anderson) consist of an 1824 decree
         of the court, a statement of accounts, notes of argument of
         the opposing counsel (Robert Stanard and Benjamin Watkins
         Leigh), and agreement and bond with Richard Anderson, and
         miscellany (copy of an amended bill of complaint and letter of
         William Fanning Wickham to Chancellor Creed Taylor).</p>
      <p>William Fanning Wickham also served for many years as agent
         or trustee for his younger sister Frances (Wickham) Graham
         after the death of her husband. Records include an account
         book, 1867=1880; loose accounts, 1871-1882; bonds, 1875-1879,
         of John Wickham (1825-1902), Littleton Waller Tazewell
         Wickham, and Maclurg Wickham; agreements, 1874-1878,
         concerning cash advances for her above-named brothers; a
         lease, 1868, to Grubbs and Williams of Richmond to a lot on
         Eleventh Street between Main and Bank streets; and a receipt,
         1881, for payment for buildings erected on that lot. Specific
         materials concerning the indebtedness of John and Littleton
         Waller Tazewell Wickham to Maclurg Wickham are comprised of
         deeds of trust, 1858-1877, to "East Tuckahoe" and "Woodside,"
         Henrico County; a deed of trust (copy) concerning mineral
         rights, 1874, granted to the James River Coal Company; a plat
         of "East Tuckahoe," ca. 1858; and materials of William Fanning
         Wickham concerning John Wickham's bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
      <p>Additional personal records of William Fanning Wickham
         (Boxes 9-10) include pardon materials, 1865 (provost marshal's
         certificate, petition to President Andrew Johnston,
         certificate of the Secretary of State (William Henry Seward),
         and pardon document); notes, charts, and materials collected
         by Wickham concerning the Carter, Fanning, Nelson, Randolph
         and Wickham families (see also general correspondence); and a
         commonplace book, n.d. (early nineteenth century), consisting
         primarily of descriptive and historical notes on England and
         English counties.</p>
      <p>Wickham's miscellany includes a sketch of Benjamin Watkins
         Leigh prepared by William Hamilton Macfarland; a personal

         consisting of notes on the U.S. Constitution and
         constitutional history; essay speech, n.d., probably made at
         Hanover Court House concerning reconstruction in Virginia; an
         inventory of personal papers; a letter, 1843, of Thomas Tabb
         Giles to William Daniel (concerning a book in the library at
         "Hickory Hill"); lines of verse; and miscellaneous notes.
         Estate materials consist of a will probated in Hanover County,
         accounts, a letter to the executor (Williams Carter Wickham),
         and bonds.</p>
      <p>Williams Carter Wickham (1820-1888), a son of William
         Fanning Wickham, trained as a lawyer but abandoned the law
         early to become a planter at "Hickory Hill." He served as a
         local militia officer prior to the Civil War and became a
         cavalry general in the army of Northern Virginia. After the
         war, he surprised neighbors and fellow veterans by joining the
         Republican party, a political organization in which he became
         very influential. For many years a second vice-president of
         the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company, Wickham also served
         in the Virginia Senate, where he opposed the Readjusters. His
         materials are represented in Series 5.</p>
      <p>An important group of three postwar letterbooks
         (letter-press) kept by Williams Carter Wickham survives in
         this collection. Volume I covers the years 1877 to 1880 and is
         largely devoted to personal and business affairs and
         Republican party politics. (Indexes to each of the letterbooks
         have been prepared by VHS staff members and are filed with the
         appropriate volumes.) Among the individuals to whom Wickham
         addresses letters in this volume are Robert Rufus Bridgers,
         Doctor Charles Carter (of Philadelphia, concerning the estate
         of Williams Carter and "North Wales," Caroline County, VA),

         plantation operations and agricultural production, Republican
         party activities, and St. Paul's Church in Hanover County (see

         addressees are Chester A. Arthur, James G. Blaine, Doctor
         Charles Carter, Robert Randolph Carter, John Callaghan (of
         Norfolk), Charles Meriwether Fry, Philip Haxall (as president

         of the Republican State Executive Committee, concerns
         activities of the Central Committee and the Republican State
         Convention in Lynchburg in August 1881, and includes letters
         written to Republican leaders throughout Virginia, especially

         elections in 1881. Among the addressees are John Callaghan,
         President James A. Garfield, Doctor Joseph Jorgenson, John
         Singleton Mosby, Arthur Alexander Spitzer, J. B. Work, and
         Samuel M. Yost.</p>
      <p>General Wickham's correspondence, 1862-1888, covers any of
         the same subjects as do his letterbooks, with the addition of
         letters concerning the offer of the post of Secretary of the
         Navy to Wickham in the administration of James A. Garfield in
         1880 and Wickham's own efforts to acquire information on his

         account books, 1875-1885, and an account book covering
         "household expenses at Hickory Hill." Loose accounts are
         scattered, but cover 1861, 1868-1888, and are heaviest in the
         years 1873-1879. Many of these accounts relate to farming,
         shipping of goods, construction of the mansion at "Hickory
         Hill," and furnishing the house.</p>
      <p>The "Hickory Hill" farm materials begin with 15 volumes of
         "farm books," 1866-1888, which bear records of expenditures
         and receipts, as well as accounts with individual laborers,
         managers, and timbermen. Loose materials, 1871-1888, include 2

         river in Caroline County that Williams Carter Wickham managed
         for his cousin, Doctor Charles Carter of Philadelphia. Initial
         materials include a deed of William Carter, William Fanning
         Wickham and Williams Carter Wickham (all as executors and
         trustees of the estate of Williams Carter [d. 1864]) to

         that survive include correspondence of Wickham with Mrs.
         Cumberland, Ann Carter (Wickham) Renshaw Byerly, and London

         of Randolph-Macon College, Ashland); and a joint resolution,
         1942, of the Virginia General Assembly concerning Henry Taylor
         Wickham.</p>
      <p>Many of Mr. Wickham's speeches over the year survive in his
         personal papers. Some loose items, 1935-1942, primarily
         concern Democratic party politics and historical subjects in
         Virginia (such as Patrick Henry's political career and college
         life at Washington and Lee University under Robert E. Lee).
         Many more items are bound together in three volumes of
         speeches and addresses (Box 31), including a number of items
         written by or about Williams Carter Wickham (1820-1888). For
         examply, in Volume I (1860-1926) there are remarks made by

         visitors' register, 1949, was kept on behalf of the Ashland
         Branch of the Garden Club of Virginia. Miscellany includes a
         membership certificate, 1896, in the Virginia Society of the
         Colonial Dames of America; a life membership certificate
         issued in 1909 by the Association for the Preservation of
         Virginia Antiquities; newspaper clippings concerning the
         Wickham and Barksdale families and "Hickory Hill"; and notes,
         recipes and lines of verse. Letters, cards and telegrams of
         condolence sent to Williams Carter Wickham on his mother's
         death in 1952 complete Box 48.</p>
      <p>Series 9 contains materials relating to Henry Taylor
         Wickham's brother, William Fanning Wickham (1860-1900), who
         trained to be an attorney and lived for many years at "Hickory
         Hill." His records surviving in this collection include
         materials concerning the Hanover Troop (Troop D of the 1st
         Cavalry Battalion of Virginia Volunteers) consisting of
         letters (including one from Governor Fitzhugh Lee, 19 July)
         written to Wickham in 1889, many enclosing bills of lading for
         military supplies; and oaths of allegiance subscribed to by
         officers and men of the unit. Wickham's personal miscellany
         includes two items of correspondence, 1874; loose accounts,
         1877 and 1889; notes and records concerning "Hickory Hill"
         farm, 1886-1888; and materials, 1900, concerning his
         estate.</p>
      <p>Henry and William Wickham's sister, Ann Carter (Wickham)
         Renshaw Byerly appears throughout the collection, but in
         Series 10 are gathered only a small number of letters,
         1869-1888, written to her by Eleanor Agnes Lee, Mary Anna
         Randolph (Custis) Lee, and William Henry Fitzhugh Lee.</p>
      <p>Series 11 contains the papers of Williams Carter Wickham
         (1887-1985), son of Henry Taylor and Elise Wickham and the
         last major character to appear in this collection. He attended
         the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., and served for many
         years in the U.S. Navy. During the Second World War he was
         hospitalized in Denver, Colo., and later Bethesda, Md., and
         retired on disability in 1945 after reaching the rank of
         captain.</p>
      <p>Captain Wickham's correspondence, 1897-1967, includes
         communications from Harry Flood Byrd, Richmond attorney
         Randolph Grayson Dashiell, Admiral William Frederick Halsey,
         and Wickham's wife, Credilla (Miller) Wickham. Records of his
         naval service consist of a letter (copy), 1940, of Doctor
         George Ben Johnston concerning Wickham's physical condition;
         grade records, 1907, and certificates of graduation, 1909,
         1911, from the U.S. Naval Academy; commissions (some signed by
         Claude Augustus Swanson, William Howard Taft and Woodrow
         Wilson); a Bachelor of Science degree awarded as a graduate of
         the Naval Academy in 1938; orders and reports concerning
         Wickham's naval service, 1941-1943; correspondence and records
         concerning his disability and retirement, 1944-1949 (including
         orders signed by James Forrestal); correspondence and records
         concerning military insurance with the Veterans
         Administration; commendation for services, 1942-1944, as
         Convoy Control Officer of the U.S. Tenth Fleet; and an
         address, n.d., of Wickham to the Hanover County Woman's Club
         concerning his early years of naval service.Miscellany is
         comprised of an undated teacher's recommendation signed by E.
         R. Whitlocke; correspondence and exams of Wickham in the
         LaSalle Extension University course in law, Chicago, Ill.,
         1945; lineage charts showing the descent of Williams Carter
         Wickham for the Virginia Society of Colonial Dames; wedding
         invitations; a membership certificate, 1912, in the A.P.V.A.;
         and collected newspaper clippings.</p>
      <p>Captain Wickham's younger brother, George Barksdale Wickham
         (1888-1928), attended Virginia Military Institute and later
         became a Richmond businessman. His records, in Series 12 of
         this collection, include school materials, n.d.-1903; grade
         reports while a student at V.M.I., 1904-1905, 1907; a wedding
         invitation, 1916; A.P.V.A. certificate, 1912; and obituary
         notices.</p>
      <p>In Series 13, the collection closes with family miscellany
         (materials of Lawrence Vernon Miller Wickham while service in
         the U.S. Marine Corps; and a commonplace book, 1973-1977, of
         Lois (Wingfield) Wickham, widow of Williams Carter Wickham
         [1917-1982]) and a few items of general miscellany (autograph
         album, 1877-1889, kept by Carrie Lee Colton in Annapolis and
         Jessup's Cut, Md.; and correspondence, 1877-1886, of Reverend
         Pike Powers of Richmond, Va.)</p>
