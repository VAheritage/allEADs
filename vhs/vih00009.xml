      <p>Aubrey Neblett Brown was born May 6, 1908, in Hillsboro,
         Texas. He attended Davidson College in North Carolina and
         earned a graduate degree in Union Theological Seminary in
         Richmond, Virginia. He married Sarah Dumond Hill (1910-1995)
         of Richmond and they had eight children. Brown returned to
         Richmond in 1943 and served as editor of the Presbyterian
         Outlook until his retirement in 1978. Throughout his career,
         Brown participated in several organizations that fostered
         improved race relations.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Series 1 concerns the Richmond Area Council on Human
         Relations (RACHR) from 1960 through 1967. The RACHR was an
         interracial council that was established during the mid-1950s.
         This council was one of many local councils in Virginia that
         functioned under the wing of the Virginia Council of Human
         Relations (a subsidiary of the Southern Regional Council). The
         purpose of the RACHR was to facilitate cooperation between the
         races through meetings and events. They also supported the
         efforts of activists who were agitating for racial
         equality.</p>
      <p>The portion of organizational records in this collection
         includes membership and solicitations lists; meeting minutes,
         which include attendees, progress notes, and future goals;
         correspondence; newspaper clippings about the RACHR; program
         announcements (1962-1964); newsletters about the activities of
         the RACHR; council brochures; financial records; and
         miscellany. Items are arranged chronologically (ca. 90
         items).</p>
      <p>Series 2 includes a variety of documents concerning the
         sit-ins in Richmond which occurred during March 1960. It
         includes letters from some of the participants to Aubrey
         Brown, as well as a letter by Brown to the administration at
         Union Theological Seminary in which he voices his support for
         the students' protest; magazine articles about the sit-ins in
         Richmond, as well as local newspaper clippings; and a brief
         report about the establishment of the Richmond Citizens
         Advisory Committee which was established during the sit-ins
         (ca. 15 items).</p>
      <p>Series 3 contains 4 items, 1960, which include
         correspondence about Christian students involved with the
         Civil Rights Movement and documents about the protest
         resignation of Dr. J. Robert Nelson, Dean of the Vanderbilt
         University Divinity School</p>
      <p>Series 4 concerns the Virginia Council on Human relations,
         1960-1968. The Virginia Council on Human Relations was one of
         several state councils established in the South by the
         Southern Regional Council. The purpose of the organization was
         to help to establish local councils and to provide them with
         support activities and news of events held by other councils.
         The VCHR and the local councils worked toward easing racial
         tensions by providing interracial gatherings, sponsoring
         speakers, and disseminating information about race
         relations</p>
      <p>This is one of the larger sections in the collection and is
         arranged chronologically. It contains some of the
         organizational records that include minutes from the board of
         directors meetings, membership solicitations, financial
         records, correspondence, newsletters, newspaper clippings
         about activities of and appointments to the VCHR,
         organizational brochures, and miscellany (ca. 140 items).</p>
      <p>Series 5 concerns the Southern Regional Council, 1952-1968.
         Established in 1944, the Southern Regional Council was an
         outgrowth of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation. One of
         the goals of the SRC was to collect and disseminate data bout
         issues related to race, particularly civil rights agitation
         and discriminatory policies.</p>
      <p>This section includes documents generated by the Southern
         Regional Council to disseminate information about race
         relations and civil rights agitation. This section is arranged
         topically: miscellaneous documents, news releases disseminated
         by the SRC, some issues of New South magazine (the official
         organ of the SRC), publications and pamphlets, reports and
         special reports that focus on specific struggles within the
         Civil Rights Movement. Within each folder, the documents are
         arranged chronologically (ca. 50 items). Series 6 dates from
         1943-1990 and contains articles about race that were published
         in the Presbyterian Outlook; documents pertaining to the
         history of the Presbyterian Outlook, edited by Brown; and two
         memos from Brown soliciting information about the Civil Rights
         Movement to be used for publication (ca. 40 items).</p>
      <p>Series 7 contains a collection of speeches, 1957-1963 and
         undated, made by Brown, arranged chronologically. The speeches
         reflect his thoughts about race relations. Some include the
         place and date at which the speech was given (ca. 15
         items).</p>
      <p>Series 8 contains correspondence, 1958-1963 and undated.
         Most of the letters in this section are addressed to Brown.
         The correspondence reflects the wide variety of sources from
         which Brown received information. A particular letter of
         interest is from Newman Hamblet, Vice President of Thalhimer
         Bros., Inc., and member of the RACHR, updating Brown on the
         status of an employee in 1963 (this employee was an
         African-American who was given a job at Thalhimers at the
         request of Brown) (ca. 15 items).</p>
      <p>Series 9 contains two news releases, 1960 and 1961. One
         concerns segregation at public schools in Georgia; the other
         concerns resistance to desegregation at the University of the
         South at Sewanee, Tennessee (2 items).</p>
      <p>Series 10 concern the Religious News Service, 1959-1963,
         and contains news excerpts about activities and events in the
         religious community (ca. 10 items).</p>
      <p>Series 11 contains organization newsletters, 1960-1989, and
         includes three newsletters from the Student Non-Violent
         Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which was established during
         1960 to help organize student protesters. The additional
         newsletters are from a wide variety of religious and civil
         rights organizations, 1960-1989 (ca. 15 items).</p>
      <p>Series 12 includes documents relating to the Conference on
         Integration of a Segregated Society, 1962, held at Vanderbilt
         University. Included are correspondence and planning notes for
         the conference, a press release, and a speech given at the
         conference. The folder with correspondence includes a letter
         from author Lillian Smith (1897-1966) to Brown about race
         relations and her book Killers of the Dream (ca. 30
         items).</p>
      <p>Series 13 concerns Brown's service as chairman of the
         Virginia State Advisory Committee to the United States
         Commission on Civil Rights.. The two documents in this section
         consist of a conference program and a list of organizations
         that met with the committee in March 1966 (2 items).</p>
      <p>Series 14 concerns Brown's service as the chairman of the
         planning committee for the Conference on People, Religion, and
         a Changing Virginia. The conference was held at the John
         Marshall Hotel in Richmond in November 1966; its purpose was
         to bring together Virginia' religious community to discuss the
         role of churches in social change. The documents in this
         section include conference information, such as announcements
         and a program guide; correspondence; a discussion guide used
         for groups during the conference, and several pages of
         handwritten discussion notes that summarize what each group
         concluded about race relations; expenditures; participants; a
         press release and newspaper clippings; and speeches (ca. 30
         items).</p>
      <p>Included in Series 15 are pamphlets and publications,
         1944-1967 and undated, about segregation and racial issues.
         Publications about Virginia include "When a City Closes Its
         Schools," which is about public schools in Norfolk (1960);
         "Events in Virginia," a pamphlet distributed by the Virginia
         State Chamber of Commerce in Richmond (1962); and "Danville,
         Virginia," a booklet about the violent civil rights
         demonstrations there (1963). This section is arranged
         chronologically according to the dates given on each
         publication (ca. 60 items).</p>
      <p>Series 16 is the largest section of the collection and
         contains a variety of newspaper clippings, 1951-1966 and
         undated, from several different papers, which include the
         Richmond Times Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the
         Christian Science Monitor, and the New York Times. The
         articles focus on racial issues and the Civil Rights Movement
         and are arranged chronologically (ca. 150 items).</p>
      <p>Series 17 is made up of miscellaneous documents, 1945-1980
         and undated, chiefly articles about race relations. Many were
         generated by religious organizations that were concerned with
         social action or made resolutions about race relations. This
         section contains three folders: the first contains dated
         documents; the second contains documents without dates; and
         the third includes handwritten notes (ca. 20 items).</p>
