      <p>Of Berkeley County, W. Va. Represented in the collection
         are James Faulkner (1776-1817), of Martinsburg, Va. (now W.
         Va.), merchant; lawyer Elisha Boyd (1796-1841), a friend of
         James Faulkner; lawyer Charles James Faulkner (1806-1884), who
         served in both houses of the Virginia legislature and in the
         U.S. House of Representatives for both Virginia and West
         Virginia; and Charles James Faulkner, Jr. (1847-1929) of
         "Boydville," Berkeley County, lawyer and West Virginia circuit
         judge, and U.S. Senator, 1887-1899.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Faulkner family papers cover three generations of one
         of the most influential families in Berkeley County, West
         Virginia. Merchants and lawyers in Martinsburg, the Faulkners
         have traditionally taken an active part in the social,
         economic, political and judicial affairs of their county, the
         state of Virginia, and West Virginia, and the nation.</p>
      <p>James Faulkner (1776-1817), an Irish immigrant, settled in
         Martinsburg and in 1796 formed a partnership with merchant
         Michael McKewan as James Faulkner &amp; Co. The company
         dissolved after two years, but James Faulkner continued to
         trade under his own name. His personal and business
         correspondence and financial records are mixed, however
         separate folders cover both James Faulkner &amp; Co. and James
         Faulkner's later mercantile activities. Among James Faulkner's
         correspondents are Mathew Carey, Dr. Richard McSherry of
         Martinsburg, Virginia congressman James Stephenson, and Mason
         Locke Weems; a letterbook, 1799-1800, kept by James Faulkner
         also contains mercantile accounts, 1806-1807. The mercantile
         folders include not only licences, legal notices and store
         orders, but also records, 1795-1796, of John Tabb &amp; Co. of
         Martinsburg and materials concerning the same of lottery
         tickets (especially for the Vaccine Institution Lottery in
         Baltimore, Md.).</p>
      <p>For many years James Faulkner served as an officer in the
         Virginia Militia. By the opening of the War of 1812, he had
         risen to the rank of major and commanded the Virginia
         artillery at Fort Barbour in Norfolk and at the Battle of
         Craney Island. His military records include early commissions,
         materials concerning the Martinsburg Independent Blues, 3rd
         Artillery Regiment, and must rolls and returns, an orderly
         book, letters and other items concerning James Faulkner's
         service in the War of 1812 (Box 9).</p>
      <p>Also found among James Faulkner's papers are land records
         concerning Martinsburg and Berkeley County; an account book,
         1811-1820, kept in part by James Faulkner as president of the
         Berkeley County Overseers of the Poor; an account and will of
         James Faulkner's father-in-law William Mackey; and estate
         materials, including an inventory, loose accounts, and records
         concerning a monument to James Faulkner in Martinsburg.</p>
      <p>Elisha Boyd (1769-1841), a contemporary and friend of James
         Faulkner, and eventually father-in-law to James Faulkner's
         son, Charles James Faulkner, was a prominent lawyer of
         Martinsburg, involved in politics and local economic
         development. His papers include correspondence, notably with
         Richmond lawyer John Wickham, and with Charles James Faulkner
         while both served in the Virginia legislature; land records in
         Berkeley County and Martinsburg; and legal materials from
         Elisha Boyd's law practice in the Berkeley County Court and
         the Virginia Superior Count of Chancery at Winchester. Also,
         Elisha Boyd's papers contain records of Andrew Waggener,
         father of Elisha Boyd's first wife, including records,
         1795-1800, of the mercantile firm of Waggener &amp; Warner in
         Berkeley County; records concerning Elisha Boyd's service as
         commander of the 4th Regiment and 10th Brigade of Virginia
         Militia; estate materials including a will, deed, notes, etc.;
         and miscellany. There are also a few items for Elisha Boyd's
         third wife, Elizabeth Hill (Byrd) Boyd, and his son, Rev.
         Andrew Hunter Holmes Boyd.</p>
      <p>Charles James Faulkner (1806-1884) is certainly the key
         figure in this collection. There is some internal evidence
         that Charles James Faulkner was born "James F. Faulkner" (see
         James Faulkner's accounts, especially 1815, inventory of
         estate, and the will of William Mackey), but changed his name
         sometime before 1825. He attended Georgetown College and then
         read law at the prestigious school of Henry St. George Tucker
         at Winchester. He began to practice in Martinsburg about 1827.
         He entered politics shortly thereafter and remained active
         throughout the rest of his life, as the following paragraphs
         will indicate.</p>

         He entered politics shortly thereafter and remained active
         throughout the rest of his life, as the following paragraphs
         will indicate.</p>
      <p>Among Charles James Faulkner's other papers (for a full
         list see guide) are records kept by John Weller, a fellow
         attorney who acted as Charles James Faulkner's agent during
         the latter's mission to France (see below). The records
         primarily concern the maintenance of the "Boydville" estate in
         Martinsburg, built by Elisha Boyd and inherited by Charles
         James Faulkner's wife. Boxes 45-46 contain additional records
         concerning "Boydville," particularly the acquisition of
         adjoining lands and contracts with laborers and tenants; and
         records of Charles James Faulkner's purchases and sales of
         land in Frederick County, Va. (the "Glengary" farm obtained
         from John Rogers Cooke in partnership with Philip Clayton
         Pendleton), Berkeley County, and Martinsburg.</p>
      <p>Charles James Faulkner's law practice comprises the largest
         portion of his papers. Box 47 contains notes kept as a student
         at the Winchester Law School, 1825-1826, and general
         miscellany of his practice such as licences, accounts, notes
         on law, etc. The papers involving actual litigation or other
         services for clients are divided into several groups: by
         court, into case files (records of four or more items,
         including writs, summonses, proceedings, bills, notes, etc.,
         relating to specific cases) and suit papers (three or less
         items per lawsuit basically arranged chronologically); by
         client (records of legal services provided over time not
         necessarily involving litigation); And by estate (including
         estate settlements in which Charles James Faulkner served as
         court-appointed administrator and settlements involving
         pension claims for service in the Revolutionary War). Box 65
         contains records kept by Charles James Faulkner and Edmund
         Pendleton as trustees for the Martinsburg mercantile firm of
         Lauck &amp; Stephen. Charles James Faulkner practiced chiefly
         in the Berkeley County Court, Circuit Superior Court, and
         Circuit Court; the Jefferson County Circuit Court; Morgan
         County Circuit Court; and West Virginia Supreme Court of
         Appeals. One interesting folder (Box 59) concerns Charles
         James Faulkner's appearance as counsel for W. Va. in the U.S.
         Supreme Court in an action by Virginia to recover the counties
         of Berkeley and Jefferson in 1870.</p>
      <p>Among the more important clients for whom Charles James
         Faulkner maintained files were the Baltimore &amp; Ohio
         Railroad Company (see also correspondence with J. W. Garrett,
         Louis McLane and Thomas Swann); Bank of the Valley in Virginia
         (see also correspondence with Henry M. Brent, Hamilton G. Fant
         and Charles Webb); and the Hagerstown Bank, Hagerstown, Md. A
         complete list of case files, client files, and estate
         settlements is filed in Box 47.</p>
      <p>Charles James Faulkner entered politics early in his
         career. The folders covering his first service in the Virginia
         House of Delegates and State Senate include campaign
         materials, speeches, resolutions and printed documents. While
         serving in the House, Charles James Faulkner was appointed
         commissioner to settle Virginia's boundary with Maryland. His
         records of that mission include documents signed by William
         Byrd II and reports Charles James Faulkner issued as
         commissioner. His Whig party activities were wide ranging; his
         papers contain materials from the 1840 and 1844 Whig
         presidential campaigns in Virginia, an unsuccessful campaign
         for Congress in 1843, and various political speeches (Box
         69).</p>
      <p>Charles James Faulkner entered Congress in 1851. His
         congressional files contain campaign materials, election
         certificates, records as chairman of the House Committee on
         Military Affairs (he took particular interest in the armories
         at Springfield, Mass., and Harpers Ferry, W. Va., and in
         bolstering the U.S. Army), printed items and news clippings,
         and a large file of miscellany (Box 70). While serving in
         Congress, Charles James Faulkner switched to the Democratic
         party. He accepted the post of chairman of the National
         Democratic Resident Committee in Washington, D.C., which was
         charged with organizing "grassroots" support in the summer of
         1856 for the election of James Buchanan as president (Boxes
         71-72). The materials, arranged chronologically, include
         circulars, committee correspondence and financial
         accounts.</p>
      <p>A grateful President Buchanan appointed Charles James
         Faulkner Envoy Extraordinary to France in 1860 upon the death
         of fellow Virginian John Young Mason. The records kept as
         minister to France include correspondence (primarily letters
         of introduction and American claims against French citizens,
         but with some official dispatches), credentials, invitations,
         biographical sketches of Charles James Faulkner (in French)
         and news clippings (Box 73). Charles James Faulkner served a
         full year, returned to Washington, and was arrested for
         several months in 1861, in effect as a political prisoner held
         for the exchange of a prominent northern congressman.</p>
      <p>After his release, Charles James Faulkner remained
         primarily in Virginia and served for a time on the staff of
         Confederate General Thomas J. ("Stonewall") Jackson. A lengthy
         broadside in the collection served to explain Charles James
         Faulkner's activities in those years, but brought forth howls
         of protest from former Confederates and pro-Union West
         Virginians alike (Box 73).</p>
      <p>With the close of the war, Charles James Faulkner struggled
         to regain a position of standing in West Virginia politics. He
         served in the 1872 Constitutional Convention as chairman of
         the committees on the judiciary and on revision. Boxes 74-75
         contain speeches, documents, resolutions, judiciary plans
         (printed) and news clippings.</p>
      <p>Charles James Faulkner returned to Congress in 1875. His
         records contain election materials, materials concerning his
         service on a three-man Committee to Investigate the Affairs of
         the Red Cloud Indian Agency (July-November 1875), papers kept
         as chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Relations,
         petitions and applications, constituent requests, lists of
         voters, clippings and miscellany. After his retirement from
         Congress, Charles James Faulkner unsuccessfully ran for the
         U.S. Senate and the office of governor of West Virginia (Boxes
         76-77).</p>
      <p>The few remaining boxes cover Charles James Faulkner's
         personal life and economic activities. He served as president
         and chief counsel of the Martinsburg &amp; Potomac Railroad
         Co., president of the Berkeley County Agricultural &amp;
         Mechanical Association, president of the West Virginia
         Historical Society, and regent of the West Virginia University
         at Morgantown (Box 78). Miscellany includes papers concerning
         a former servant at "Boydville," Mary McGuire; letters
         concerning Charles James Faulkner's visit to Great Britain in
         1846; schools and education (including addresses); news
         clippings; freemason materials; and estate records.</p>
      <p>Charles James Faulkner's wife, Mary Wagner (Boyd) Faulkner
         (d. 1894) lived at "Boydville" most of her life. Her papers
         include correspondence; an account book and loose accounts; a
         commonplace book kept in France, 1860; records concerning a
         claim against the U.S. government for damages at "Boydville,"
         1863-1865; and personal miscellany (Box 81).</p>
      <p>Elisha Boyd Faulkner (b. 1841) lawyer, W. Va. legislator
         and judge, was the Faulkner's eldest son. He practiced law in
         Hopkinsville, Ky., after the Civil War, but returned to
         Martinsville in the 1870s to practice in partnership with his
         younger brother. Box 82 contains his correspondence, a few
         case files, and personal miscellany.</p>
      <p>Charles James Faulkner (1847-1929) inherited "Boydville"
         from his mother. He practiced law, served as a West Virginia
         circuit judge, and entered the U.S. Senate in 1887. His
         records as a senator (arranged chronologically) include
         letters from constituents, petitioners, fellow Democrats and
         senators concerning congressional activities and Democratic
         politics; speeches and printed items; and news clippings
         (Boxes 87-88).</p>
      <p>Several small folders of papers concern Charles James
         Faulkner's first wife, Sallie Winn (d.1891) of
         Charlottesville, Va., her mother Mary Jane (Garrett) Winn
         (1818-1869), and her brother John Winn (b. 1838?). Mrs.
         Faulkner's sister, Elizabeth Garrett Winn (b. 1840?) lived in
         Martinsburg for many years. She was a popular belle in
         Charlottesville in the immediate postwar years, and later
         became a teacher in West Virginia. Her papers include
         correspondence, accounts, a commonplace book, ca.1867, records
         of her teaching career, 1873-1880, at the Martinsburg Grammar
         School, and personal miscellany (Boxes 90-93). Another sister,
         Ellen Watson Winn (1842?-1893) cared for the children at
         "Boydville" after Mrs. Faulkner's death. Papers of the second
         Mrs. Faulkner, Virginia Fairfax Whiting (1867-1938), are
         entirely financial in nature (Box 93).</p>
      <p>Box 94 contains a few items each for Charles James
         Faulkner's sisters and their husbands, and his children.
         Miscellaneous Berkeley and Jefferson county records and some
         unclassified miscellany round out the collection.</p>
      <p>Lastly, volumes transferred to this collection in April
         1986, including account books for James Faulkner (1779-1817),
         Elisha Boyd (1769-1841), Andrew Waggener, Charles James
         Faulkner (1806-1884), Lauck &amp; Stephen, Martinsburg, Va.
         (now W. Va.), Isaac S. Lauck &amp; Co., Winchester, Va., Isaac
         S. Lauck &amp; Co., Martinsburg, Va. (now W. Va.), and Charles
         James Faulkner (1847-1929) are filed on the open shelves at
         the end of the collection.</p>
