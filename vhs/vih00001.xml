         County, Va., who maintained a large household made up of her
         immediate family, her husband's sister, children who attended

         John Edwin Roller of Harrisonburg, Va., and had an active
         domestic and social life; and Margaret Etta (Cabell) Matthews,
         who married an Anglican missionary and lived with him for
         several years in Liberia; and Elizabeth Henry (Roller)
         Bottimore, of Richmond, Va., and Glens Falls, N.Y., daughter
         of Lucy Brown (Cabell) Roller, who maintained an extensive
         social correspondence with friends, many of whom lived in or
         frequently travelled to foreign countries. 
         <!-- <lb />
         <lb /> -->In general the correspondence concerns domestic
         activities, including courtship and marriage, the births of
         children, illnesses and deaths, problems with servants, and
         the procurement of clothing and other household articles; the
         running of the Inglewood school and the work of other family
         members, split between teaching and the law; and social
         activities in Nelson County, Harrisonburg, and Richmond, Va.,
         among the Cabell and Roller families and a wide network of
         friends and relations. 
         <!-- <lb />
         <lb /> -->Also included are the papers of John Edwin Roller, a
         Harrisonburg, Va., lawyer and active member of the Republican
         Party, largely concerning his plans to run for the Virginia
         House of Delegates in 1872 and his relationships with his
         wife, her daughters, and his daughters from his first
         marriage.

            <p>Correspondence of Gen. John Edwin "Ned" Roller,
                  chiefly falling into two periods, 1870-1872,
                  concerning Roller's plans to run for election to the
                  Virginia House of Delegates, and 1895-1916,
                  concerning his marriage in 1896 to Lucy Brown Cabell,
                  and after, concerning his family life. Many
                  correspondents from the earlier period give details
                  of political sentiment on the local level (see
                  William Withers Adams, William B. W. Brooking, Henry
                  B. Harnsberger, Henry Marcellus Keyser, John Marshall
                  McCue, William Merry Perkins, E. D. Pettit, Charles
                  Summerville Rohr, Lawrence Royster, Ezra Eugenius
                  Stickley, William Harrison Triplett, John Richard
                  Wingfield, Charles Junius Woodson, and others).
                  Non-family letters from the later period are
                  typically letters of congratulations on his marriage.
                  <lb/>Letters to Lucy Brown Cabell during their
                  courtship discuss the objections of Roller's teenage
                  daughters to their marriage, the age difference
                  between Roller and Lucy, and Lucy's father's
                  objections to the proposed marriage settlement.
                  Letters after their marriage are chiefly exchanged
                  while Roller is traveling on business and during
                  Lucy's annual visits to her family at Inglewood,
                  Nelson co., and discuss their children and domestic
                  issues. 
                  <lb/>Letters to Roller from daughters Frances Lewis
                  (Roller) Grattan and Margaret Stuart (Roller) Cannady
                  Ogilvie Merryman concern their attendance at Woman's
                  College, Frederick, Md. (now Hood College), in
                  particular social activities and financial needs.
                  Letters from Roller to daughters Elizabeth Henry
                  (Roller) Bottimore, Anne Woolston (Roller) Pyle, and
                  Lucy Cabell Roller contain family news and fatherly
                  advice while they are away visiting Cabell relatives.
                  <lb/>Also included is scattered correspondence with
                  Roller's brothers, Oliver Brown Roller, Peter Samuel
                  Roller, Robert Douglas Roller, and William Wirt
                  Roller, largely concerning the financing of their
                  respective educations. Oliver attended the Virginia
                  Military Institute, Lexington, Va. Peter attended
                  Augusta Military Academy. Robert attended the
                  Episcopal Theological Seminary of Virginia.</p>
