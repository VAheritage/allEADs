         <p>James Lindsay Almond, Jr., was born June 15, 1898, in
         Charlottesville, Va., the son of Lindsay and Eddie Nicholas
         (Burgess) Almond. At an early age his family moved to a farm
         in rural Orange County, Va. Almond entered the University of
         Virginia in 1917 as a member of the Student Army Training
         Corps but withdrew a year later and consequently served for a
         year as principal of the Zoar High School near Roanoke, Va.,
         1921- 1922. He then entered the University of Virginia School
         of Law and earned his law degree in 1923. He had been admitted
         to the Virginia Bar in 1921. He was in private practice as a
         lawyer in Roanoke, Va., 1923- 1932, and quickly became known
         for his handling of criminal cases.</p>
         <p>A Democrat, Almond's interest in politics began in his
         teens. His involvement with Democrat Harry Flood Byrd began in
         1925, when Almond made several speeches in support of Byrd's
         gubernatorial campaign. With Byrd's help, Almond was appointed
         assistant Commonwealth's attorney for the city of Roanoke,
         1930-1933, and a judge of the Roanoke Hustings court,
         1933-1945. He was later appointed to the 79th U.S. Congress
         and elected a member of the 80th U.S. Congress. The Virginia
         Democratic Party, led by Harry F. Byrd, asked Almond to step
         down from his Congressional seat and run for attorney general
         of Virginia, to which position he was elected in 1948. He
         served in this office until 1957, at which time he resigned to
         run for governor of Virginia.</p>
         <p>Both Almond's campaign for and service as governor were
         dominated by Virginia's response to the Supreme Court's school
         desegregation edict. As governor, he inherited a program of
         "massive resistance" designed to halt school integration by
         erecting a series of defensive obstacles. Realizing the
         movement was doomed and if continued would potentially destroy
         the Commonwealth's educational system, in January 1959 Almond
         admitted defeat and established a commission to develop a plan
         for the integration of Virginia's public schools. Almond's
         reversal on this issue cost him the support of the Harry F.
         Byrd and his many supporters.</p>
         <p>Following Almond's term as governor, he was appointed by
         President John F. Kennedy as an interim judge of the U.S.
         Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, Washington, D.C. With
         U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd on the Senate Judicial Committee,
         it took much campaigning on the part of Almond's friends and
         supporters to secure his official appointment to this post in
         1963. He served as a member of this court until his retirement
         in 1986.</p>
         <p>J. Lindsay Almond married Josephine Katherine Minter
         (1901-1992) in 1925. A native of Roanoke, Va., Mrs. Almond
         attended Elizabeth College in Salem, Va., and received her
         bachelor's degree in 1923 from Wittenberg University in Ohio.
         The Almond's had no children, but raised Mrs. Almond's orphan
         nephew, Lewis S. Minter, from infancy. Mr. Almond died April
         14, 1986, and is buried in Evergreen Cemetery, Roanoke,
         Va.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>Series 1 contains the non-official correspondence of J.
         Lindsay Almond, Jr., 1925-1983, chiefly as governor and while
         he was seeking a federal judgeship. Subjects mentioned include
         concerns of constituents; recommendations of persons for
         appointments by various state and local officials; the attempt
         on Almond's life in April 1959; Almond's stand on school
         desegregation (see the correspondence of Alburtis S. Harrison,
         Jr., Charles L. Lady, and Sydney F. Small); and the efforts of
         Almond's supporters to get him a position on the U.S. Court of
         Patent Appeals (see the correspondence of George Edward Allen
         (1885-1972), Miner Carl Andrews, Lester R. Bachner, Harry
         Flood Byrd (1887-1966), James O. Eastland, Charles Rogers
         Fenwick, Eppa Hunton IV, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Robert
         Francis Kennedy, Marvin E. Nuckols, Jr., and A. Willis
         Robertson). This appointment was blocked for almost a year by
         U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd, a member of the Senate Judicial
         Committee, who had broken with Almond over the latter's
         apparent reversal of his support of school desegregation and
         the policy of "massive resistance." Also included is scattered
         family correspondence, chiefly concerning the health of
         Almond's mother, Edmonia Nicholas (Burgess) Almond (d.
         1966).</p>
         <p>Series 2 contains speeches given on various occasions.
         Subseries 2.1, Speeches by J. Lindsay Almond, are arranged
         chronologically. See 1958-1960 for the bulk of speeches
         concerning school desegregation. Subseries 2.2, Speeches by
         Others, is arranged alphabetically by author.</p>
         <p>Series 3 includes scattered financial and legal records,
         1948-1978, of J. Lindsay Almond, Jr., consisting of records of
         sale and purchase of residential real estate in Roanoke and
         Richmond, Va., loose accounts and papers including forms
         relating to his employment as a federal judge, canceled
         checks, an account book for his expenses relating to the last
         illness and death of his mother, Edmonia Nicholas (Burgess)
         Almond (d. 1966) of Locust Grove, Va., and miscellaneous items
         including an affidavit concerning the Virginia Senatorial
         campaign of 1946 and its connection with the C.I.O. Political
         Action Committee and a list of firearms owned by Mr.
         Almond.</p>
         <p>Series 4 includes scrapbooks, 1934-1963, containing chiefly
         newspaper clippings from Richmond and Roanoke, Va., newspapers
         documenting the various careers of J. Lindsay Almond, Jr. The
         volumes are arranged in four subseries as follows: Subseries
         4.1 documents Almond's career as a judge of the Roanoke City
         Hustings Court and as a member of the U.S. House of
         Representatives. Series 4.2 documents Almond's return to
         Virginia to serve as Attorney General. Subseries 4.3 documents
         Almond's campaign for, election as, and service as governor of
         Virginia. Prominently mentioned is his fight against
         court-ordered desegregation of public schools. Subseries 4.4
         in many ways overlaps previous subseries but also includes a
         scrapbook concerning the Roanoke Racing Homer Club, Roanoke,
         Va., of which Almond was a member, and a 1963 barbecue given
         in Almond's honor.</p>
         <p>Series 5 consists of newspaper clippings, 1931-1987,
         arranged chronologically, chiefly from Roanoke and Richmond,
         Va., papers. Subjects include Almond's service as Attorney
         General of Virginia, campaign for and election as Governor of
         Virginia, the "massive resistance" movement, and the Almonds'
         life after leaving office. See also: Oversize.</p>
         <p>Series 6 contains brief biographical statements,
         occasionally in resolution form. Some items were evidently

         consists of Almond's appointment registers, 1951-1961 (90 v.)
         kept while he was Attorney General and Governor of Virginia.
         Entries are short, often containing only the name of the
         person visiting. Occasionally mention is made of subject
         matter to be discussed. Almond's attendance at official
         functions (including receptions, luncheons, conferences) is
         also noted. Subseries 7.2 consists of miscellaneous volumes,
         including a letterbook, 1919 April 30-May 9, containing drafts
         of letters from J. Lindsay Almond to Josephine Katherine
         (Minter) Almond; student notebook, 1923 March 4-June 1, kept

         qualification to appear before various courts, masonic
         materials, and miscellaneous items received during Almond's
         careers. Of special interest are his diploma from the
         University of Virginia, 1923; his law license, 1921; a
         certificate of appointment to the U.S. Court of Customs and
         Patent Appeals, 1962, signed by John F. Kennedy and Robert P.
