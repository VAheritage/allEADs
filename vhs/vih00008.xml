         of Robert's son-in-law Richard Baylor (1803-1862) of
         "Kinloch," Essex County, Va. The collection contains letters
         amounts of material concerning other family members, including

      <p>Baylor and Waring families of Essex County, Va. Represented
         are Robert Payne Waring (1775-1844) of "Edenetta" and
         "Kinloch," planter and merchant; his son-in-law, Richard
         Baylor (1803-1862); Richard's sons, Robert Payne Baylor
         (1840-1872), Richard Baylor (1849-1914), and Henry
         Latan&amp;#38914;aylor (1853-1930); and grandson Richard
         (1883-1953).</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection is devoted almost entirely to records of
         the acquisition of land by the Baylor and Waring families of
         Essex County, Virginia, and the subsequent development and use
         of these lands for agricultural purposes. The land and farming
         records span several generations over three centuries, but
         have been divided by generation where appropriate.
         Consequently, records concerning "Kinloch" in Essex County, or
         "Sandy Point" in Charles City County, for instance, will
         appear under several different headings. Researchers should
         read this description and the guide which follows thoroughly
         before embarking on an examination of these papers in order to
         be aware of the several locations of related records. The
         summary description highlights some of the most important
         aspects of the collection, while the guide provides a
         thorough, though not exhaustive, listing of materials.</p>
      <p>The earliest records in the collection are primarily land
         records of the Baylor, Payne and Waring families, including an
         opinion of the celebrated attorney Benjamin Watkins Leigh
         (1781-1849) concerning the estate of Robert Payne Waring
         (1746-1799). For a full listing, see guide. Also of interest
         is a larger ledger kept by merchant Mordecai Booth
         (ca.1703-1775) in Yorktown, 1746-1752, which includes
         information on the ship "Mermaid". Other early family members
         for whom a few records are available in this collection
         include Robert Baylor, father of Richard Baylor (1803-1862),
         and William Waring, a Revolutionary War officer and uncle of
         Robert Payne Waring (1775-1844).</p>
      <p>Robert Payne Waring (1775-1844) is the first major figure
         for whom substantial material exists in this collection.
         Waring's diaries generally concern planting, harvesting, and
         weather, although random references are found to religion and
         his church activities. The diaries are bound with copies of
         David Richardson's Virginia &amp; Carolina Almanac for the
         appropriate years. Among his correspondence is one
         particularly interesting letter from Episcopal clergyman
         Stephen Higginson Tyng (1800-1855). Waring's accounts cover
         personal expenses and plantation operations; one account book,
         1815-1818, appears to concern the operation of a mercantile
         firm with Bevin Dandridge Pitts (d.1860?). Among the collected
         land records are materials tracing the title to "Port Micou,"
         (including legal opinions of Benjamin Watkins Leigh and John
         Tyler [folder 3] and a tract called simply "William Taylor's
         Place" (later "Cavanaugh's"), a part of the Port Micou-Kinloch
         consolidated tract in later years. For a summary of the title
         histories to Call Number Waring's various tracts see the notes
         of Richard Baylor in the folder marked "estate materials" (Box
         3)</p>
      <p>Robert Payne Waring (d.1838), son of the above, died young,
         and his father handled many matters regarding his estate. For
         "Glencairn," the younger Waring's residence in Essex County,
         see the deed in Box 3 filed with the father's miscellaneous
         land records.</p>
      <p>Richard Baylor (1803-1862) purchased the "Kinloch" estate
         and built his mansion there in the 1840s. For the design and
         construction of the home see his correspondence with Robert
         Cary Long (1810-1849), Baltimore architect, and the folder on
         "Kinloch" in Box 6, which includes architectural drawings.
         Baylor purchased the "Sandy Point" estate in Charles City
         County from Robert Buckner Bolling (1805-1881) in the 1850s
         and his cousin Thomas Gregory Baylor (1815-1864) served there
         several years as manager. Again, see correspondence and the
         appropriate folders in Box 6. Other important correspondents
         include Thomas Gregory Baylor (1837-1890), U. S. ordnance
         officer at Fortress Monroe, Va., and Robert Selden Garnett
         (1789-1840), sending a printed message concerning Bevin
         Dandridge Pitts and Robert Mercer Taliaferro Hunter (1809-
         1887). Many letters from neighbors and acquaintances concern
         the purchase and welfare of Negro slaves; these are
         supplemented by a folder in Box 6 covering slave
         purchases.</p>
      <p>Materials of the Old Dominion Steamboat Company, in which
         Baylor was a stockholder, include correspondence of officers
         with Baylor, stock certificates, reports, and other records.
         Materials concerning agricultural societies include an address
         by Richard Baylor as president of one such local unit (the
         Agricultural Society of Essex County?) and membership
         certificates for himself and family in the Virginia State
         Agricultural Society. Box 6 also includes a photocopy of the
         St. Anne's Parish vestry minute book, 1787-1857, kept in part
         by Baylor as secretary. Estate materials include legal
         opinions of Arthur Alexander Morson (1801-1864), records
         concerning "Sandy Point," Charles City County, and guardian
         accounts for minor children of Richard Baylor kept by Robert
         Payne Baylor (1840-1872).</p>
      <p>Materials relating to William Balor (1805-1895) consist of
         diplomas.</p>
      <p>Robert Payne Baylor's correspondence includes lengthy
         exchanges with Robert William Baylor (b.1841) concerning saw
         mill operations at "Sandy Point," and Richard Walke
         (1840-1901) concerning the estate of Richard Baylor. Most of
         Robert Payne Baylor's correspondence, accounts, bonds and
         miscellany concern farming operations at "Greenfield,"
         "Kinloch," "Marl Bank," "Port Tobago" ("Port Tobacco") in
         Essex County, and "Sandy Point" in Charles City County. They
         include records of the sale to or confiscation by Confederate
         Officials of agricultural produce.</p>
      <p>Richard Baylor (1849-1914), brother of the above, had
         extensive correspondence with his younger brother Henry
         Latan&amp;#39392;Baylor (1853-1930) as farm manager at
         "Kinloch" and owner of "Edenetta" in Essex County, his son
         Richard Baylor (1883-1953), lawyer Richard Walke, and Henry
         Waring, as farm manager at "Sandy Point," Charles City County.
         Most of his papers also relate to farm operations and
         management, including laborers contracts, wage records,
         blacksmiths' accounts and account books kept by Alexander
         Tunstall Brooke (1855-1927) at "Marl Bank," Essex County.</p>
      <p>In 1920 "Kinloch" was sold. Materials concerning the sale
         may be found in the "estate" folder of Isabella Thorburn
         (McIntosh) Baylor, wife of Richard Baylor (1849-1914), in Box
         21. Among Henry Latan&amp;#39392;Baylor's papers are records
         of a lawsuit instituted in Essex County Circuit Court in 1921
         to establish title to the "Kinloch" estate. Then follow
         folders of a few items each for Richard Baylor's sisters.</p>
      <p>Richard Baylor (1883-1953) is the last major figure
         represented in the collection. After the sale of "Kinloch," he
         continued agricultural operations at Marl Bank Farms, near
         Iraville. His account books include payroll information for
         workers at "Kinloch," "Marl Bank," and "Port Micou."</p>
      <p>Also included are miscellaneous family materials, including
         correspondence, legal records, newspaper clippings,
         genealogical materials, and printed materials.</p>
