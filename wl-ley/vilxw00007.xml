      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Robert E. Lee, 1807-1870</p>
      <p>The sixteen R.E. Lee items (11 of them ALS) cover a date
         span of 22 years - from 1847 through 1869. A number are
         perfunctory, but two letters seemed to me extremely
         interesting. The first, written aboard the Ship Massachusetts
         off Lobos, Mexico, on 28 February 1847, during the Mexican War
         to "My dear Major," contains a beautiful description of
         Tampico and the natural riches Lee saw there. He is
         enthusiastic about the fruit, vegetables, and fish in the
         market and about having seen chocolate growing. "In fact I was
         charmed with Tampico, &amp; if it depends upon my vote, it
         will never fall back to Mexico." He also describes Lobos
         Island, the coral reef around it, and the rubber tree he has
         been. "It is the most remarkable growth I have even seen."</p>
      <p>His letter of 8 September 1865 to Matthew Fontaine Maury
         who was in Mexico attempting to establish a settlement there
         after the Confederate defeat, is beautifully expressed. In it
         he makes very clear that he feels it is best for
         ex-Confederates to stay in the United States and attempt to
         heal wounds and build, rather than to leave in despair. Yet he
         writes to Maury (and in an earlier letter to Richard Maury,
         Matthew's son) without judgment for the step Maury has taken.
         Again he expresses his admiration for Mexico. "The salubrity
         of its climate, the fertility of its soil, &amp; the
         magnificence of its scenery, possess for me great charms, but
         I look with delight upon the mountains &amp; rivers of my
         native State still." He realizes that those ex-Confederates in
         Mexico are profiting from Maury's presence, "but I shall be
         very sorry if your presence be lost to Virginia." She has now
         need for all her sons, and can ill afford to spare you."</p>
      <p>Mary Randolph Custis Lee, 1808-1873</p>
      <p>There are 10 ALS of Mrs. Lee ranging from the early 1850s
         in Baltimore to shortly before her death in Lexington in 1873.
         Although Mrs. Lee's handwriting is extremely hard to decipher
         and most of her letters are undated, I found her letters the
         most interesting group in the collection with the possible
         exception of those of her father, George Washington Parke
         Custis. One reason for this is that Mrs. Lee's personality
         shines through clearly ' and it is not always as charming as
         her father's. Yet one feels she is very real, very human.</p>
      <p>In one of several letters to Benson Lossing who helped her
         publish G.W.P. Custis's book on Washington, she vents her
         anger at former slaves in what would now be regarded as very
         racist remarks. She expresses bitterness over the loss of
         Arlington, over Grant's being on the presidential ticket, and
         about the fact that her poor health prevents her from going
         out into the green spring or on a trip to Europe. In a letter
         appended to an affectionate note from Rooney (about 15 at the
         time) to Custis at West Point, she needles her eldest son
         about his backwardness with women and worries over the state
         of his studies. She reminds him to read his Bible - and quotes
         "Aunt Lewis" as saying "she can give you no better advice than
         to follow in your Father's footsteps."</p>
      <p>Mrs. Lee has lively details about the various spas she went
         to and gossip about the flirtations of the young. She also
         mentions her painting, a talent she apparently inherited from
         her father.</p>
      <p>George Washington Parke Custis, 1781-1857</p>
      <p>The Seven ALS of Mrs. Lee's father (and George Washington's
         step-grandson) were a delightful surprise. A man of many
         interests (farming, theatre, painting), his charm emerges in
         most of his communications. An especially enlightening and
         colorful letter is that of 16 September 1839 to his wife and
         daughter who were away on a visit. In it he describes the
         activities at Arlington, the crops, the animals, the repairs
         to the house, the servants, and reports that "I have an
         increase of piggy wiggys..." He speaks of partridges and
         poachers, peaches and quince. The quality of his wool is good
         - and he has seen fit to send "two Beets, one squash to the
         Horticultural Exhibition."</p>
      <p>Another interesting letter is to the Honorable Henry Wise
         who was apparently exploring the possibility of establishing a
         bathing facility. Custis, who had inherited Smith's Island,
         tries to persuade Wise to consider that island, where there
         would not only be good bathing but good wild mutton, fishing,
         shooting, "egging," and lots of timber. He thinks that a
         Southern resort would have various advantages over Cape May,
         Saratoga, and Newport.</p>
      <p>His letter to Benson Lossing, 2 December 1855, discusses
         his plays and the large battle scenes he loved to paint.</p>
      <p>The Lee Girls</p>
      <p>There is only one letter from Agnes (1841-1873), but it is
         affecting in its hints about her feeling of loneliness and
         isolation in Lexington (14 January 1867).</p>
      <p>Four letters from Mildred (1846-1905), all expressive of
         her personality, are in the collection. To Matthew Maury (M.
         F. Maury's grandson who was Mildred's godson), she wrote on 4
         January 1874 a poignant note thanking him for a cross he had
         sent which she has placed on Agnes' grave. An undated early
         letter to Preston Cocke has a flirtatious tone. Although she
         turns him down for a ride (it is too hot), she praises his
         poetic bent. In another undated letter from London to "Mary,"
         she says she hates the city and longs for trees and grass.</p>
      <p>The Lee Boys</p>
      <p>One of the letters I liked most from a Lee Boy was a R.E.
         Lee, Jr.'s to Capt. Edmund R. Cocke (14 January 1866) in which
         he says if any woman will build him a house he'll marry her.
         Also: "I came within an inch of having a chill, but a kind
         friend took me in to the bar (concerned you know) &amp; we
         both took the 'bath' hot strong &amp; some sugar &amp; emon in
         it which turned my liver from its vile intentions." After
         signing his name he adds: "formerly Lt. C.S.A. (&amp; so
         called at large) &amp; now an Esquire dwelling in the wildest
         wilds of the loneliest corner of King William Co. said co.
         being the loneliest of the lonely."</p>
      <p>William Henry Fitzhugh Lee's boyhood letter to his brother
         Custis from Baltimore on February 15 , 1852 has been
         mentioned. William Henry Fitzhugh or "Rooney" was 15 at the
         time. In an affectionate, lively letter, perhaps intended to
         cheer up his sober elder brother, Rooney does his best to
         cover the important news. Washington Lewis, who has been
         visiting, is to be married to a woman Rooney "beleave[s]" to
         be not very pretty though very good. He himself is going to go
         to dancing school "to learn to trip it." Uncle Smith is off to
         sea; Rooney is beginning Horace and reading Xenephon in Greek.
         If Custis's spirits were raised by Rooney's note, they were
         soon to be dampened by his mother's which was appended (see
         above).</p>
      <p>Custis's own letters which display the best handwriting of
         all the Lees are nevertheless probably the dullest in the
         collection (though Fitzhugh Lee's run them a close second).
         And Fitzhugh's handwriting was terrible! After the war,
         Fitzhugh, Lee's nephew, was obsessed with land deals and
         taxes; and his correspondence bears witness to this. Most of
         the letters here are to his cousin and attorney, Charlie Kerr,
         in Baltimore.</p>
      <p>Dates for the Lee Boys are as follows: 
         <lb/>George Washington Custis 1832-1913 
         <lb/>William Henry Fitzhugh (Rooney): 1837-1891 
         <lb/>Robert Edward Jr. 1843-1914 
         <lb/><lb/>Fitzhugh (nephew of General Lee): 1835- 1905</p>
      <p>The Older Lees</p>
      <p>Francis Lightfoot Lee (1734-97), Richard Henry Lee's
         brother (see Lee Family tree) and like him prominent at the
         time of the Revolution, is represented in the collection by a
         loving letter to "My dearest," no doubt hi wife, Rebecca
         Tayloe.</p>
      <p>Richard Henry (1733-94) reports in a letter of 2 August
         1781 to "your excellency" two deserters from the Continental
         army, the McKenny brothers. "They have twice deserted and are
         bad men." Another letter (21 October 1778) is addressed to
         Patrick Henry, governor of Virginia, and concerns the means of
         "paying the arrears due to the Continental Soldiers in
         Virginia and to the Militia of that State..."</p>
      <p>Robert E. Lee's brother, Charles Carter Lee (1798-1871), in
         two letters to his cousin Nat Burwell, expresses his anxiety
         about his brother Robert's impending return from the Mexican
         War. "The Officers returned from Mexico all say that Robert's
         is the most enviable reputation in the army..." And "I have
         attended the arrival of the Southern cars for the last three
         mornings in hopes to see Robert get out of them, but have been
         disappointed, &amp; now fear he has taken the route up the
         Mississippi. However, it is a great gratification to see that
         he has arrived safely in the country."</p>
      <p>The Lee Associates</p>
      <p>General Beauregard's and General J. E. Johnston's letters
         were interesting to me because of their letterheads which gave
         an indication of how some Confederates got involved in
         post-war businesses.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most interesting letter in the "associates"
         group is from Benjamin Hallowell (1799-1877), who was Robert
         E. Lee's tutor in Alexandria in 1824. This letter, written
         from Sandy Spring, Md. In 1873 to his cousin Robert Miller,
         gives a detailed account of the history of Alexandria's water
         supply and the establishment of a waterworks there in the
         1850's. Beautifully expressed in an old-fashioned style, he
         outlines how one can move men forward towards a worthy
         project. When taking up a subscription for the waterworks, he
         prompted the wealthy citizens to give large amounts by giving
         generously himself. "The effect was Electric. I, a poor man,
         going so far beyond the wealthy ones, gave Ã©clat to
         the subject." In graphic and interesting detail, he discusses
         the choosing of Frederick Erdman, an engineer who had
         successfully completed waterworks for Harrisburg, Pa. And
         Frederick, Md., for the job in Alexandria, and also relates
         how many of the problems in the project were overcome.</p>
      <p>Another charming letter is that of 30 January 1873 from the
         Staunton, Va. Cartographer, Jed Hotchkiss, to his wife, from
         London. Besides telling her what he has bought for her, he
         gives instructions about the work his men should do while he
         is away, and explains why he has been delayed. "I feel quite
         confident of the financial result of my trip and that I shall
         soon be able to do better for you my dear, dear one than I
         have ever had it in my power to do before."</p>
      <p>Final mention will be made of Margaret Junkin Preston
         (1820-1897). Two letters in the collection that were written
         before her marriage are to Mr. Sartain, a magazine publisher
         whom she wants to persuade to accept her writings. For a
         mid-19th century young Lexington woman, she shows a
         surprisingly practical, business-like approach and
         assertiveness.</p>
