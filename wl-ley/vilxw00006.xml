         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The collection covers nearly all phases of Hodges' career
         as economist and public official, from 1908 until 1942, when
         he retired from the Army Ordnance office. Early materials
         include reports on Southern agriculture and immigration for
         various agencies. Hodges' first efforts to reform and
         streamline Virginia state government may be seen in the
         minutes and papers of the Virginia Commission on Economy and
         Efficiency. There is considerable correspondence from his
         service as aide and director of the Budget under Governors
         Davis and Trinkle. In 1924, Hodges became the first managing
         director of the Virginia State Chamber of Commerce; his
         activities reflected in the official and unofficial
         correspondence, included development of trade relations with
         Great Britain and other countries and the creation of the
         "Five-Five" (later "All Virginia") program designed to enhance
         the state's internal economy, efficiency, and sense of civic
         pride. Also included are the Chamber of Commerce's
         publications and numerous addresses by Hodges on trade and
         economic issues. During this period Hodges continued to
         participate in the State Prison Board (he served as the
         president) and as Colonel in the Virginia National Guard; the
         collection contains his "Ordnance Notes" and other papers
         relating to aspects of ordnance and defense preparation in the
         period between the wars. Hodges' office files as Comptroller
         include reports, addresses, proposals, and organizations
         requesting him to speak. A small amount of material concerns
         his brief service during World War II with the War Department,
         which was cut short by illness.</p>
         <p>Col. Hodges' correspondents include economists, government
         officials, businessmen, and other prominent figures in
         Petersburg and Richmond. Among the names represented are W.
         Jett Lauck, James H. Price, Gordon Bohannon, Junius P.
         Fishburn, Francis P. Miller, Robert H. Tucker (Prof. Of
         Economics at Washington and Lee), members of the "Virginia
         Musketeers" (a group of businessmen and officials in the
         Richmond area), John W. Davis and Lady Astor.</p>
         <p>The collection is of interest to students of reform and
         government efficiency movements in Virginia politics as well
         as students of Virginia economic history and army
         ordnance.</p>

         <head>Organization</head>
         <p>The collection was processed before 1981, but was still in
         disorder when cataloged in 1984. It was clear that the
         original organizational principle reflected the stages of
         Hodges' career, and the revised order of series reflected
         this. Ignore original file folder numbering.</p>
