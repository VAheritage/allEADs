      <p>George W. owens was born on January 21, 1875 on a farm near
         Alma, Kansas. He attended the local district schools near
         Alma, where at times he, his brothers,and his siters were the
         only African American pupils in school. After finishing school
         he then took the local examination for a teachers certificate.
         After receiving his certificate,with high grades, he moved to
         Manhattan in 1896 to attended Kansas State agricultural
         College where he became the first African American to graduate
         in the year of 1899.</p>
      <p>In September of 1899 he went to Tuskegee Institute where he
         took over the management of the Dairy Herd and the production
         of all dairy products. He continued there until 1907. In 1908
         Professor George Washington Owens was invited to Virginia
         State where he would also be put in charge of all operations
         concerning the school's dairy.</p>
      <p>In 1926 Owens and others formed "The New Farmers of
         Virginia" which was later renamed " The New Farmers of
         America". The overall purpose of this organization was to
         encourage the young men to improve their vocational skills at
         work, on the farm,other educational activities, and also their
         social life as connected to work. He is considered to be the
         founder of the Department of Agriculture and was honored
         having the Agriculture building named for him.</p>
