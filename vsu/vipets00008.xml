      <head>History of the Reformed Zion Union Apostolic
Church</head>
      <p>James Richard Howell established the Reformed Zion Union
Apostolic Church in 1869, although the beginnings of its
foundation can be traced back to 1865. James Howell was a
native of New York City where he was an elder of the African
Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. Elder Howell, who was an abolitionist, envisioned a church to evangelize the
Southern "Negro." </p>
      <p>Elder Howell left his home in New York City and boarded a
train heading south. Several hours later he had arrived in the town of LaCrosse in Mechlenburg, Virginia. This is where he began to form
the Reformed Zion Union Apostolic Church. Howell began to talk
with individuals concerning the church he envisioned. These
individuals appeared to have been interested in his idea. On on April
1, 1869, a delegation including ministers from various
denominations, assembled in Boydton, Virginia to consider
Howell's plan of union.</p>
      <p>The plan of union was accepted by the delegation with
exception of some matters relating to the episcopate
government. Elder Howell won suggestion of his new
denomination, the Zion Union Apostolic Church. The name came
from many of the scriptures that Howell read. Zion was the stronghold
of ancient days, therefore, Zion would be the stronghold of
God's people in this age. As Christ taught oneness of himself
and the heavenly father and his oneness with his followers,
so, too, shall his church dwell as a union. </p>
      <p>During October 1869, a second meeting was held at the          Zion Society to complete the work of a Zion Union Society. At
this meeting guidelines for the general rules were adopted and
Elder Howell was elected to a four-year term as President of
the "Zion Union Apostolic Church of America."</p>
      <p>The denomination was divided into three major factions, the
liberals, who had withdrawn from the Episcopalian communion,
the conservatives, who had been in the white Methodist church,
and the fundamentalists who had come from the Baptist churches
or were new converts to Christianity. The three factions made
almost unceasing war on each other. The liberals were perhaps
a decade ahead of their time in plans and ideas. The
fundamentalists were determined to fight for local church
sovereignty and the immunity of the pastors from any authority
except local congregations. The conservatives hued strictly to
the Methodist line, in doctrines and in practices. Bishop
Howell was almost a faction within himself. He used his powers
of appointment, silencing and expulsion of ministers as a
sledgehammer to drive the stakes of Zion according to his own
designs.</p>
      <p>Controversy became rampant and even bitter. The
struggle the between the bishops and the elders became more divisive to the church when
a movement grew to merge the Zion Union Church with the
Episcopal Church. Bishop Howell fought with an abrasive
tenacity and the division was so sharpened that some Elders
and churches withdrew from Zion.</p>
      <p>Bishop James Howell released himself from his duties of
bishop from 1880-1881. Bishop William Howell was a man
considered agreeable to conservatives, liberals and the 
fundamentalist. Bishop Howell immediately approved ineffective
with the opening of the conference of 1880. His first order of
business was the merger of the Episcopalian government. After
four days of meetings on the matter, a motion prevailed that
the Common Book of Prayer would be adopted. The conference
ended with the Zion Union Apostolic Church being organized into   thirty-eight Episcopalian churches and missions.
and purposes.</p>
      <p>The merger, however, was as a yet one-sided affair. James
R. Howell came out of the Conference more determined than ever
to save his beloved Zion. When the Annual Conference of 1881
was called to order, Howell had done little on the merger
except the rather astringent efforts of opposition. Once
returned to office of Bishop, James R. Howell used his powers
to batter his opponents. The shock of his fury tore the church
asunder. The Conservatives found it necessary to go to the
Bishop and once again point out the grave situation. Howell
acceded. He set to work to hear the breach in Zion. He
successfully arranged a Conference in 1882 to put Zion Union
on one accord. The Conservative leadership took over once the
Conference was called to order and set in motion plans, which
would free Zion Union of discord. The Conference ended with
differences worked out, a return to presidential government
and complete rejection of the merger. From this conference,
the church was known as the Reformed Zion Union Apostolic
Church. However in the Conference of 1884, the Episcopacy
government was restored with the ruling that is shall never be
eliminated.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Reformed Zion Union Church papers (1876-1974) are vital
papers about the formation of a denomination after the Civil
War. These papers give a detailed account about the beginnings
of this denomination and its founder James Richard Howell.</p>
      <p>Howell, a former member of the African Methodist Episcopal
Zion Church, envisioned a church where all could go to worship
regardless of race, creed, or color. Howell determined to see
his vision come true, set out to find a place for this church.
He boarded a train and found himself in LaCrosse, Virginia and
this is where the Reformed Zion Union Apostolic Church
denomination began.</p>
      <p>These papers document the origins, purposes and functions
of a uniquely African American Christian church. They
represent a church that was not in existence until 1869. These
papers have a distinct worth because it gives you an
understanding of how a church was established after the Civil
War.</p>
      <p>These papers include minutes from Annual Conferences,
Sunday School Conventions, Home Missions and Educational
Convention, Women's Home Mission and Educational Society, the
Reformed Zion Union Sabbath Schools, and Rising Zion Young
Peoples Society.</p>
      <p>The papers are useful not only to members of this
denomination but anybody who is interested in how black
churches were formed after the Civil War. These materials also
help to inform us of the structure of the African American
community after the Civil War. These materials document some
of the activities in Virginia's black belt. Also, these papers
may also be useful for genealogical work because quite a few
names are used.</p>
