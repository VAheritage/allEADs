         <p>Luther Hilton Foster was born May 26, 1888 in Clover,
         Halifax County, Virginia. He was the son of Oliver S. and Mary
         Elizabeth Foster. His early childhood schooling was at the
         public school of Halifax County and the Saint Paul's
         Polytechnic institute in Lawrenceville, Virginia. Here he
         completed his studies, and was awarded his Normal Degree in
         1907. Upon his completion from Saint Paul's Polytechnic
         Institute, he then studied at the University of Chicago School
         of Commerce and Business Administration.</p>
         <p>He began his career as a public school teacher and later
         was a bookeeper for several years at the Saint Paul's
         Polytechnic Institute. In 1913, at the age of twenty-four, he
         became Treasurer-Business Manager of Virginia Normal and
         Industrial Institute, a position which he held for
         twenty-nine-years.</p>
         <p>In addition to joining the administration, Luther Hilton
         Foster married Miss Daisy Octavia Poole of Surry County
         Virginia in September of 1913. Three children were born to
         this union, a son Luther Hilton Foster Jr., and two daughters
         Virginia S. Foster (Hendricks), and Mary Allen Foster (
         Burleigh II).</p>
         <p>In 1912, upon the retirement of Dr. John Gandy, Mr. Foster
         served as acting president of the Virginia Normal and
         Industrial Institute. He was then named the fourth president
         of the college in 1943, serving in that capacity until his
         death in 1949.</p>
         <p>Foster was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D by Morris
         Brown College, Atlanta University in 1940, and by Virginia
         Union University in 1943. He was named to the Honor Roll of
         the Richmond Times-Dispatch for the year of 1942. An article
         in the Virginia Teachers Association Bulletin gave recognition
         to Foster in March 1943. He also received special mention by
         the General Education Board because of his business ability.
         Foster was founder of the Association of Business officers in
         schools for Negroes as it was called in 1929 when first
         established. He was the first president of the organization,
         now the American Association of College Business Managers.</p>
         <p>Foster was a member of the executive board of the
         Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia, a trustee
         and member of the board of Bishop Payne Divinity School in
         Petersburg, Virginia and of the board of Saint Paul's
         Polytechnic Institute, Lawrenceville, Virginia. He was a
         member of the executive committee of the Negro Land Grant
         College Association and a member of the executive committee of
         the Virginia Association for Education, chairman of the
         association's Special BuildingFund.</p>
         <p>He was a member of the General Improvement Commission of
         the Virginia State Planning Board. Dr. Foster was also
         administrator of the Virginia Graduate Aid Fund for Negro
         Students. He served as executive scout advisor to the J.B.
         Brown division of Boy Scouts of America. He was a member of
         Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, the Protestant Episcopal Church,
         and of the A.F. and A. Order of Masons.</p>
         <p>He died July 6, 1949, and was buried in Blanford Cemetery
         in Petersburg, Virginia. Funeral services were held Friday
         afternoon July 8, at 12:30 from the Virginia Hall
         Auditorium.</p>
         <p>June 6, 1950, Nottoway County of Virginia named its new
         high school, in honor of Dr. Luther H. Foster. Foster High
         School is an 18-classroom building located four miles west of
         Blackstone. Dr. Foster, for six years in the presidential
         chair, served to bring additional prestige and worth to the
         school, which he had already helped develop to a noted degree
         in thirty years of proceeding service. He was an expert
         Administrator, but he will be remembered longest as
         counselor.</p>
         <p>Luther Hilton Foster Hall, the student activities building
         is dedicated to the memory of the fourth president of Virginia
         State University, 1942 to 1949, and its Treasurer-Business
         Manager from 1913-1942.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The Luther Hilton Foster papers, which are founded in this
         manuscript group do not begin to reflect the prosperous and
         varied life of the man who was the Treasurer Business Manager
         of Virginia State University for twenty-nine years, and the
         fourth president of the university for six years. These papers
         do however touch some of the highlights of his life away from
         official campus duties.</p>
         <p>During the time span of these papers, (1928-1931), Foster
         was active with various organizations. This manuscript group
         is interesting in dealing with some of his activities with
         several Petersburg social and civic organizations. Of prime
         interest is his correspondence detailing the attempts of the
         African American Community to establish a local Boy Scout
         chapter.</p>
         <p>In addition to his role with the Boy Scouts, he was also
         active with the Petersburg Civic Association, and the Negro
         Land Grant College Conference.</p>
         <p>Luther Hilton Foster was a very active man known throughout
         Petersburg, and on Virginia State's campus. These papers will
         reflect on Foster's personal life, and on some of his social
         and civic activities throughout the City of Petersburg.</p>
         <p>Additional information about him may be found in Virginia
         State University Archives in VSU.RG 4F and VSU.RG 5.</p>
