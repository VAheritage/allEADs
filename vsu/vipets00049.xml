      <p>The Ettrick Mill Cemetery began in the 1800's when the
         Hartley Company designated an area as a burial ground for
         their workers. Many of their employees were from North
         Carolina and various places in Virginia, Which made it
         difficult to ship their bodies home after they died. The
         cotton mill owned the property but the cemetery was operated
         as a public cemetery,however, cotton mill workers recieved
         burials there free of charge.</p>
      <p>After the factory closed, the cemetery was not maintained
         well. Mrs. Sadie Archer Bowman became interested in restoring
         the cemetery in conjunction with her work with the Home
         Demonstration Club. In 1949 Virginia State University acquired
         several acres of the plat which did not contain graves. The
         money from that was turned over to Mrs. Bowman and was used to
         restore the cemetery.</p>
      <p>In addition to the mill workers Forty-five confederate
         veterans and one Union soldier are buried in the cemetery. On
         October 17, 1951, the Chesterfield Chapter of The United
         Daughters of The Confederacy dedicated a marker in memory of
         the confederate soldiers.</p>
