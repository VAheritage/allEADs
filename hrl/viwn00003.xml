<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Dr. Robert Macky (1737 - 1814) was a Scotsman by birth and is thought to have been a Quaker. He came to Virginia from Pennsylvania. He was the surgeon in the 11th VA Regiment of Foot during the Revolutionary War and at one point served with Colonel Daniel Morgan. He was also personal physician to Lord Fairfax.</p>
<p>Dr. Macky was active in business and politics and became both weathly and influential. On January 31, 1778, he received a land grant of 430 acres in Hampshire County from Lord Fairfax. In 1779, he purchased the James Dowdall Lot #60 on the north side of Piccadilly Street and the east side of Drury Lane (present day Braddock Street), where he built his home. Dr. Macky also purchased Lot #77 from the estate of George Washington in 1804. </p>
<p>Dr. Macky died March 10, 1814 at his residence on the corner of Braddock and Piccadilly Street (where the current Old Post Office building now stands). He and his wife Catherine were both buried in the garden of their home. When the home was razed the Post Office and adjacent parking lot were built over the garden. The graves were never moved.</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection holds a ledger belonging to Dr. Robert Macky, a physician who practiced medicine in the Winchester-Frederick County area. The ledger contains records of treatment and the sale of medicines to patients between the years 1796 to 1808. The ledger records the names of a number of individuals who lived in the area as patietns, and often includes information about locations of dwellings and occupations. The names of other doctors consulted in the course of treatment are also included.</p><p>Entries for each account may show family members, guests, hired workers, and enslaved persons receiving treatment. African Americans are sometimes listed by name under each account, making this book a potentially valuable resource for researchers looking for materials on enslaved persons. Additionally, Macky served as a physician for the Overseers of the Poor of Frederick County and his records names a number of individuals who were supported by the county because of infirmity of poverty. Last, the ledger provides valuable insight into the state of medical treatment in this period.
