               <p>"The collection was not brought together by writing big checks to leading dealers.

            <p>Alexander Mackay-Smith's "working library" today forms the nucleus of the University of Virginia's Music Library. The Mackay-Smith Collection, presented to the University in 1946, includes complete runs of what at that time constituted virtually all the major musicological journals, an impressive array of major reference works, bibliographies, printed library catalogues, monographs, and, above all, scores.</p>
            <p>The collection's greatest strength is in contemporary editions of 18th-century instrumental music, particularly trio sonatas. An accomplished amateur violinist, Mackay-Smith acquired much of his chamber music for purely practical purposes. His chamber music partners included his brother, Carleton Sprague Smith, flutist and chief of the New York Public Library's Music Division from 1931 to 1943 and again from 1946 to 1959; Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, pianist, composer, and patroness of music; and Constance Darden, violinist and violist, wife of the University of Virginia's President, Colgate Darden.</p>
            <p>The majority of the works represented in this catalogue were purchased in Paris and London between 1928 and 1934. After graduating from Harvard in 1924, Mackay-Smith spent several years in Europe:<blockquote>
                  <p>I bought my first early music from Harold Reeves in London in the summer of 1928 when I was able to acquire virtually all the 18th century editions, particularly of trio music, which he then had in stock, going back not only through his current but also through earlier catalogues, picking out numbers which remained unsold. It is almost a shame today to think of the prices at which such things were then available, one or two pounds apiece.<ref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="r2" target="n2">2</ref>
                  </p>
               </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>Otto Haas, in Berlin and then later in London, was another source for much of the music described here. Following World War II, Mackay-Smith deposited his entire music collection with the University of Virginia Library:<blockquote>
                  <p>The University seemed like a logical place to deposit [it], since my children are descended from Thomas Jefferson; since, as you well know, Jefferson played the violin almost every day of his life...<ref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="r3" target="n3">3</ref>
                  </p>
               </blockquote>
               <blockquote>
                  <p>It is particularly fitting, I think, that the chamber music for violin which Thomas Jefferson so enjoyed playing should now be fully represented at the University which he founded.<ref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="r4" target="n4">4</ref>
                  </p>
               </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>The Mackay-Smith Collection in fact shows similarity to the music section of Jefferson's own catalogue of 1783. It is scarcely coincidental that the trio sonatas of Carlo Antonio Campioni (1720-1788), one of Jefferson's favorite composers, are especially well represented. Jefferson had at one point taken the trouble to transcribe some 38 incipits of works by Campioni already in his library, with a note in the margin to a London dealer asking for any other works he had also composed, "Solos, Duets, or Trios. Printed copies would be preferred..."<ref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="r5" target="n5">5</ref>
            </p>
            <p>It was in much the same systematic fashion that Alexander Mackay-Smith developed his own collection of instrumental chamber music, with special emphasis on the trio sonata. A lawyer by profession, Mackay-Smith might also confess, as had Jefferson, that "music is the favorite passion of my soul."<ref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="r6" target="n6">6</ref>Jefferson, however, had been forced to concede that "fortune has cast my lot in a country where it is in a state of deplorable barbarism." That these circumstances no longer obtain is due in no small measure to the efforts of Alexander Mackay-Smith and other collectors like him.</p>

            <head>Editorial Method</head>
            <p>The form of entry for each composer's name follows that in the Library of Congress authority file, where such an entry exists, or<ref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" target="NewGrove2">The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd ed.</ref>. In the case of composers whose works were first published during both the 18th and 19th centuries, only composers born before 1770 have been included. This is approximately the same criterion for inclusion in RISM Series A/I.</p>
            <p>A brief filing title is provided to facilitate browsing and ensure a logical and consistent sequence among entries. The form is essentially that established by the second edition of the<bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
                  <title>Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules</title>

               </bibref>. A few minor exceptions have been adopted for the sake of both brevity and clarity.</p>
            <p>Unless otherwise indicated, all individual parts within a set have identical title-pages. The format (folio, quarto, etc.) is based on the number of times the original sheets of paper have been folded to make individual leaves.<ref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="r7" target="n7">7</ref>The terminology for the oblong formats is that suggested by D. W. Krummel.<ref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="r8" target="n8">8</ref>Two sets of dimensions are given for all engraved title-pages: the first represents the imaginary rectangle that would enclose all elements of the engraved surface; the second measurement, in parentheses, represents the plate mark. The names of individual parts are transcribed exactly as they appear on the parts themselves, usually as running heads. The system used for describing pagination has been taken from Cecil Hopkinson's various bibliographies of Berlioz, Gluck, Puccini, etc., and is self-explanatory. No attemp has been made to collate gatherings.<ref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="r9" target="n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The title of each work and its sequence of movements and keys are transcribed as they appear on the first part listed in the work's contents. Any exceptions to this, the primary source of information, are specifically noted in square brackets.</p>
            <p>For dates, the terminology used is that recommended by the<bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
                  <title>International Association of Music Libraries' Guide for Dating Early Published Music</title>
               </bibref>.<ref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="r10" target="n10">10</ref>Whenever possible, dates of issue are provided; for lack of sufficient evidence, however, most dates in this catalogue must be considered dates of editions.</p>
            <p>All citation to the Répertoire international des sources musicales, unless otherwise noted, are to<bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Series A/I, Einzeldrucke vor 1801, edited by Karl-Heinz Schlager (Kassel: Bärenreiter, 1971-1981)</bibref>. If the Mackay-Smith exemplar differs significantly from the entry appearing in RISM, discrepancies are noted in parentheses following the RISM number.</p>
            <p>The dates that appear at the end of many of the call numbers derive from the original cataloguing of the collection at the University of Virginia in the late 1940s. Although an integral part of the call number, they have no significance in and of themselves.</p>

               <p>Title-page transcription taken from keyboard part. Title-pages of string parts differ slightly: "CONCERTS" in place of "CONCERTI"; no ampersand before "Composés..."; period after "LONDRES". The title-pages of the keyboard and string parts are otherwise identical and appear to have been produced from the same original plate, with the alterations noted here.</p>

               <p>Hummel used at least three different opus numbers for this set at different times. The original title-page (represented in this exemplar) reads "OEUVRE V". The set was listed in Hummel's catalogues as op. 6. Johansson/Hummel, v. 1, p. 19, states that "some copies have the opus number V, which has been changed to IV by the addition of "I" in ink." Hummel later re-issued the set with a new title-page and the opus number VI.</p>

               <p>RISM questions the attribution of this set to Alberto Gallo, presumably on the grounds that it may be by Domenico Gallo, another composer of trio sonatas. Le Clerc, however, published Alberto Gallo's opera 1 and 2, and no works by Domenico Gallo. The attribution to Alberto Gallo thus seems the more likely of the two.</p>

               <p>Hummel's edition was already listed in his first catalogue, that of 1762 (<ref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" target="Johansson-Hummel">Johansson/Hummel</ref>, v. 2, F. 1). This is perhaps a pirated edition. The plates, in any case, are unquestionably Hummel's.</p>

               <p>Sonata III had been published by Neil Stewart in Edinburgh in 1761 under Sammartini's name, but Bathia Churgin and Newell Jenkins ("Sammartini, Giovanni Battista," The New Grove, v. 16, p. 456) consider it to be of doubtful authenticity . Churgin (Sammartini/Sonate, p.8) does not include it among the composer's authentic trio sonatas. A later Walsh issue of this set (no.174) attributes all six sonatas to Lampugnani.</p>

BUCEM dates this as ca. 1765, but Brotonne was not at this address after 1757 (<ref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" target="Devriès-Lesure">Devriès-Lesure</ref>, v.1, p. 162).</p>
