<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The letters in this collection were written because former President of Radford University, John P. McConnell wrote to a number of what he called outstanding Virginians in 1933 to write a return letter containing any comment they had about Virginia, its history, its resources and its problems in the future. Dr. McConnell wanted to create this collection and donate it to the Radford University Archives in order to preserve all of the facts, ideals and ambitions of Virginia.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection contains correspondence from distinguished citizens of Virginia in response to a request by Radford College President John Preston McConnell in 1933. Responses to McConnell's request are collected here, and include letters, pamphlets, memoirs, reports, news articles, newsletters, and various documents about Virginia.</p>
<p> This is the letter that describes how the collection was organized by J. P. McConnell. Original order has been preserved.</p>
<p> <blockquote><p>November 8, 1935</p></blockquote>
<title render="doublequote">The replies received from distinguished citizens are enclosed in twenty-one booklets or volumes, numbered from I to XXI. In each booklet or volume are included as many replies as there was sufficient space on the outside of the booklet for the name of the writer of the communication inclosed. This simplifies the whole matter of consulting at any time the contents of the series of booklets or volumes. As stated elsewhere any additional communications from distinguished citizens will be inclosed in the proper booklet.
