<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>M'Ledge Moffett was born in 1892, the only child of William Ledgerwood Moffett and Mary Stoops Moffett. The name M'Ledge was formed from shortened versions of her parents names, Mary and Ledgerwood. Moffett's came to what is now called Radford University as a faculty member in 1913 as the youngest faculty member and the only member of the Household Arts Department. For the first several years after the college opened, Moffett taught all of the Household Arts courses (Elementary Sewing, Elementary Cooking and Household Management) which met five times a week. In 1920, the Radford Normal School was reorganized and President J.P McConnell appointed Moffett as the new Dean of Women, a year before she received her Master of Arts degree. She was the first person to hold that post at any of the Virginia institutions of higher education. She held the Dean's post until her retirement in 1962. She died in 1969.</p>
<p> The Home Management House (or Cottage) provided Home Economics majors at Radford to live together in a house situation and actively practice skills such as home budget planning, cleaning, cooking, meal planning, housekeeping, and other tasks. Living in the Home Management Cottage carried credit, and was listed as Home Economics 46: Home Management Cottage in the 1934 Radford State Teachers College Bulletin. From the 1934 Bulletin: Home Economics 46: Home Management Cottage: This unit of work is an experiment in co-operative living, giving ample opportunity for each student to put into practice the knowledge gained previously and to develop responsibility. Each of the housekeeping activities - cooking, table setting and serving, cleaning, acting as hostess and manager, budget-making and buying - is done in the home atmosphere rather than in a laboratory. Here classroom theory and laboratory experimentation are converted into real home-making knowledge. Emphasis is placed on development of appreciations, ideals and standards rather than skill. Required of all seniors one quarter. Credit, one session hour.
