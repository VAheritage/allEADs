<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The photographs in this collection were housed in a file cabinet that was delivered to Archives and Special Collections by Lora Gordon, University Photographer, in Spring 2009, and contains photographs taken by the Radford University Public Relations photographs and contract photographers from approximately 1980-2001. The photographs consist primarily of promotional photos taken to accompany press release or to meet special photography requests. Examples include scenes of campus or events that were requested by regional newspapers. Other photographs were taken of groups, ensembles, performers, dignitaries, or guest artists who came to campus. The photographs were in housed in labeled file folders (Academics), and have retained the original file order and folder labeling.
