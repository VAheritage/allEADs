<abstract label="Abstract">M'Ledge Moffett served Radford primarily as Dean of Students and Professor of Health Education, and was on the faculty from 1913 until her retirement in 1962. Beginning in 1915, Moffett began collecting newspaper articles related to Radford and its students, faculty, and staff, pasting them into scrapbooks in chronological order. Newspapers are not specificially identified, but the clippings appear to come from various papers from Radford, the New River Valley, and Virginia. Researchers should note that the individual newspaper clippings rarely contain information about what specific newspaper a clipping is from, and sometimes do not have specific dates for individual clippings.

<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>M'Ledge Moffett was born in 1892, the only child of William Ledgerwood Moffett and Mary Stoops Moffett. The name M'Ledge was formed from shortened versions of her parents names, Mary and Ledgerwood. M'Ledge came to teach at what is now Radford University in 1913 as the youngest faculty member and the only member of the Household Arts Department. For the first several years after the college opened, Moffett taught all of the Household Arts courses (Elementary Sewing, Elementary Cooking and Household Management) which met five times a week.In 1920, the Radford Normal School was reorganized and McConnell appointed Moffett as the new Dean of Women, a year before she received her Master of Arts degree. She was the first person to hold that post at any of the Virginia institutions of higher education. She held the Dean's post until her retirement in 1962.She died in 1969.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1915, Moffett began collecting newspaper articles related to Radford and its students, faculty, and staff, pasting them into scrapbooks in chronological order.
