<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The Edmondson Electric Company was formed by the Edmondson brothers and was located in Meadowview, VA. The Virginia State Corporation Commission issued the company's charter, 11482, on January 6, 1914. The first company president was E.H. Edmondson and S.W. Edmondson served as company secretary. Shortly after being issued its charter the company began construction of the Edmondson Dam on the Middle Fork of the Holston River, not far from Emory, VA. Upon completion the dam was 30 feet tall, 36 feet wide at its base, and 200 feet long. The dam served as the company's hydroelectric facilty starting in 1921, with a maximum capacity of 2000 horsepower and a minumum of 1000 horsepower. The Edmondson's hydroelectric operation supplied the towns of Chilhowie, Meadowview, Emory, Glade Spring, and Abingdon with electricity. The dam formed a small lake that served as a swimming and fishing hole for locals. Lake Pocahontas Camp was built on the lake's edge and offered a mountain retreat to young boys and girls in the mid 1920's. The dam and hydroelectric plant operated until 1963, when it was closed due to maintenance issues. It remained unused until it was partially demolished in 1982. Today the dam still spans the Middle Fork of the Holston River at a height of approximately 14 feet.
