<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The Iron Worker was a company publication of The Lynchburg Foundry, which had plants in Radford and Lynchburg, Virginia. Lynchburg Foundry Company was founded in 1896 in Lynchburg, Virginia, and spent its first several years consolidating stock and building capital. In 1903 it constructed a plant in Lynchburg to produce iron pipe. In 1905 it purchased the Radford Pipe Works, which was originally developed by a group of Cincinnati investors that included J. N. Gamble of the Proctor &amp; Gamble Company. The Radford plant went into receivership for a while, and was idle before being purchased by the Virginia Iron, Coal, and Coke Company, which operated it as the Radford Pipe Works for about a year, when VICC then leased the plant to Glamorgan Pipe and Foundry until 1905, when it was sold to Lynchburg Foundry.
