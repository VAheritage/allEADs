<head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
<p>In 1841, the William Wirt encountered a whaling boat, the Acushnet,which counted Herman Melville as a crewman. Melville scholars have
used early logbooks of the William Wirt (part of Harvard Library's
collections) to help reconstruct Melville's life on a whaling ship. The
research of these scholars is documented in Herman Melville's Whaling
Years, written by Wilson Lumpkin Heflin, Mary K. Bercaw Edwards, and
Thomas Farel Hefferman (Vanderbilt University Press, 2004).

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>McConnell Library's collection of William Wirt material includes a logbook of the William Wirt beginning in 1850-1851, while the ship was under the
command of Captain Owen Fisher. In addition to the voyages of the
William Wirt, this logbook also logs the voyages of the Anadie from
1851-1852. These nautical logbook entries take up the first half of this
volume (a number of pages have been removed from the center of the
book.) The second half of this volume consists of a diary starting in March 1858, documenting daily life, the arrival and departure of ships, letters
from ships' captains, and other incidents surrounding sea life. The diary
continues through 1861 and picks up again in the period from 1864-1893.
Following the diary entries are a number of recipes and a few home
remedies, along with some accounts (possibly from a sailing ship). The
author(s) of the diary entries is unknown. Several of the pages toward the
end of the book are written in pencil and are very faded.
