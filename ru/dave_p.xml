<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Dr. David Wilbur Peters was president of Radford College from 1938 to 1951. He was born in Franklin County, VA, and obtained his undergraduate degree at Roanoke College, then received M.A. and P.h.D degrees from Columbia University. Dr. Peters visited Radford on several occasions before his appointment as president in 1938 due to his membership of the State Department of Education. His professional career also included various administrative and teaching positions in Campbell County and Richmond. During his years as president, Dr. Peters oversaw the transition of Radford to the Women's Division of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and guided the school through vast post-World War II growth.
