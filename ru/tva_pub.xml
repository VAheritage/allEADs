<head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
<p>The Tennessee Valley Authority was created in 1933 by the Tennessee Valley Authority Act (TVA Act) as a part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. The goal of the TVA was to address issues in the Valley such as energy, environmental stewardship and economic development. In the 1940's during World War II, TVA created one of the largest hydropower programs undertaken in the US. In the 1960's the TVA began building nuclear plants and through the 1990's TVA kept wholesale electric power affordable and reliable. The TVA is perhaps best known for it's construction of dams throughout its history. The Authority is still in operation today.
