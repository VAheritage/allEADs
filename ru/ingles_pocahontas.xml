<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p> The Ingles and Pocahonatas Literary Societies were founded in 1913 as the first extracirricular activities on what is now the Radford University campus. The societies were named to honor outstanding women. The Pocahontas Literary Society,often referred to as Pocas, was named in honor of the daughter of Virginia Indian Chief Powahatan. The Ingles Society was named in honor of Mary Draper Ingles, who was captured by Indians and later made her way back to her home. </p>
<p> Literary societies were often the forerunners of fraternities and sororities. Activity of such societies could include formal debates on issues of the day such as religion or politics. Activities could also include orginial essays, poems or music being presented. In addition, such societies could have a hand in intamural sports and social gatherings. Usually two literary societies existed on each college campus and would compete for members and acknowledgement. Literary Societies began to decline as Greek chapter and organizations of the modern day fraternities and sororities began to be established.
