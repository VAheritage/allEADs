<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Southwest Virginia was among the last part of the state of Virginia to be settled by Europeans with settlers consisting mainly of English, Germans and Scots-Irish. The first major industry for Southwest Virginia was salt. The region incorporates the towns and cities of Blacksburg, Bristol, Buena Vista, Christiansburg, Covington, Galax, Lexington, Martinsville, Norton, Radford, Roanoke, Salem and Wytheville. In the late 1800's and early 1900's, industries such as coal mining and the cutting of timber became important in the region. Since the early 2000's natural gas extraction has grown into an important industry. Tourism has also taken off as an industry in the region due to it's history in the Civil War and American Revolution.
