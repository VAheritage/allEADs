<head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
<p>This ledger book was used at Brook(e) Hall in Washington County on the Lee Highway, rather in between Emory and Henry College and Glade Spring. It contains transactions from the 1830s. Brooke Hall was owned by Colonel Alexander Biers, According to John Preston McConnell, Brooke Hall was a very imposing palace or residence on the Lee Highway. Alexander Biers was a great farmer, slave-owner, and business man. He owned and operated a mill at his place for all kinds of grain, a carving machine, saw mill and general store, a distillery and tannery and participated in about everything that an old-time Virginia farmer of the very highest order carried on. His house, Brooke Hall, was the stopping place for many distinguished men from Tennessee, and the Southwest on the way to Washington, Richmond, Baltimore, and the eastern sections of population and influence. - notes from John Preston McConnell's letter of provenance. Brooke is the spelling Dr. McConnell uses, but Brook is found in the ledgers.
