<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Dr. James Lewis Early was a son of William K. Early and Miss Mary Louisa Belo. Dr. Early's father was a Veteran Confederate Soldier and served as a Private to Colonel A. C. Dunn and General W. E. Jones for about four years before being honorable discharged from Service. William K. Early also appears to be a close relative to General Jubal Early, Robert E Lee's "Bad Old Man." - information came from Ancestry.com and from the materials in this collection.
</p>
<p> James Lewis Early was born about 1877 in Virginia. He Resided in Saltville, Smyth, Virginia and worked for Mathieson Alkali Works as an Assistant Surgeon. On the evening of June 30, 1910 at 8:00 PM Dr. J. L. Early and Miss Melita Rorer Wilson were married in Radford. The Couple soon moved back to Saltville where they had a home established. Mrs. Dr. James Lewis Early was the daughter of William A. Wilson and Miss Mary Miller Wilson.</p>
<p> James Lewis Early was not only a prominent physician in Saltville, but he was also a prominent shooter. He loved the sport and even held onto newspaper clippings that recorded how well he did. He was also a member of the Elk's Lodge and received a postcard from the Elk House in Jacksonville, Florida. </p>
<p> In 1922 at the annual convocation of the Grand Lodge of Virginia he was elected deputy grand master of the Free and Accepted Masons - information came from Virginia Medical Monthly volumes 47-48 page 727.</p>
