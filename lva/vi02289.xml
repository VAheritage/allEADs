      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Essex County was named probably for the English county or perhaps for Algernon Capell, second earl of Essex. It was formed from Old Rappahannock County in 1692. The county seat is Tappahannock.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Essex County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1728-1914, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.
</p>
      <p>Commonly found surnames among the plaintiffs and defendants include Andrews, Atkins, Banks, Baylor, Beazley, Bird, Bohannan (also spelled Bohannon), Boughan, Boughton, Bray, Brizendine, Brockenbrough, Broocke, Brooke, Brooks, Brown, Burke, Campbell, Carter, Cauthorn, Clarke, Clements, Covington, Cox, Crow, Croxton, Daingerfield, Davis, Dillard, Dishman, Dobyns, Dunn, Durham, Dyke, Edmundson, Eubank, Evans, Fauntleroy, Fisher, Games, Garnett, Gatewood, Gordon, Gouldman, Gray, Greenwood, Haile, Hawkins, Henley, Hill, Howerton, Hundley, Hunter, Jeffries, Johnson, Jones, Latane, Lewis, Lumpkin, Mann, Matthews, Micou, Miller, Mitchell, Montague, Moody, Motley, Munday, Muse, Newbill, Noel, Owen, Parker, Pitts, Purkins, Rennolds, Richards, Richardson, Roane, Robinson, Rowzee (also spelled Rowzie), Sale, Saunders, Scott, Shackelford, Smith, Spindle, Taylor, Thomas, Trible, Upshaw, Walker, Waring, Webb, Wright, and Young.
</p>
<p>These records also contain 1 folder of “Orphan Chancery,” which has been processed but not indexed. These records contain parts, often single items, of chancery causes that could not be further identified as belonging to a certain case.</p>

</p>
