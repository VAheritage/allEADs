      <p>Joseph (b. 1730) and Phebe Sexton (b. 1734) settled in
         Wythe County, Virginia. Their son Joseph Sexton (1772-1829)
         established a tannery and saddling business in the town of
         Evensham, later Wytheville, Virginia. His sons David
         (1809-1882) and John Sexton (1811-1868) continued the
         business. John Sexton and his wife Priscilla Sexton's son John
         M. Sexton was mortally wounded at the battle of Monocacy
         Bridge, Maryland, and died at Frederick, Maryland, 6 August
         1864, and was reinterred in Wytheville in April 1866. Another
         son, Joseph Campbell Sexton (b. 1833) served as an officer on
         the staffs of Stonewall Jackson and John B. Gordon, and took
         over the tannery after his father's death.</p>
