      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Organizational Records, both volumes and loose records, are in some cases transferred to the Library of Virginia as components of court record transfers. These business records in some cases were simply stored in the local court building for safe keeping by officers/ leaders in the organization. In other cases, Organizational records (particularly ledgers, account books, etc.) may have been filed in a court case as an exhibit. This organizational records appeared both in chancery causes and in judgments, these records serving as exhibits for debut suits, and contract disputes.

<p> <emph render="bold">Historical Information:</emph>Cumberland Baptist Church was founded in 1810 by Joseph Jenkins. The church first met in a log building. Members of Cumberland Baptist church met alternately at Booker's Meeting House and Tar Wallet Meeting House between 1836 and 1843 when the congregation divided. The members living near Tar Wallet formed a separate church and the remaining members constituted Cumberland Baptist Church. The congregation met at Booker's Meeting House from 1856 until 1858 when the congregation began meeting at Jenkins' Meeting House.</p>


<p><emph render="bold">Scope and Content:</emph> Cumberland Baptist Church Record Book, 1856-1896, kept by various members of the church, consists of 286 pages and largely records the church's monthly and quarterly meetings and additional church business. 
</p>
<p>Church business activities documented in the volume includes: date and location of meetings; names of members attending meetings; election of church officers; reports of church officers; reports to James River Association providing the number of both white and Black members; resolutions passed by church membership; and decisions made by the church membership related to the activities of the church such as excommunication of members, reconciliation of church members, and baptism of new church members. </p>
<p>The church's membership included Black and multiracial individuals, most of whom were enslaved by white church members. The record book lists the names of enslaved individuals baptized and their enslaver. The volume also records the withdrawal of Black and multiracial members from the church in 1866 for the purpose of forming a Baptist church for the Black community.</p>
<p>The record book includes an index that lists in alphabetical order the names of church members. The index includes additional information such as the year the individual joined the church, the year they were removed from the membership roll, and the reason for their removal (excommunication, death, transfer of membership, etc.)</p>
<p>Families indicated as members of Cumberland Baptist Church include: Jenkins family, Anderson family, Reynolds family, Dowdy family, Dunkum family, Meador family, Nunnally family, Parker family, Sanderson family, and Talley family.</p>
