      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph>Greensville County was named either for Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene, commanding general of the Continental army in the South during part of the Revolutionary War, or for Sir Richard Grenville, leader of the Roanoke Island settlement of 1585. The county was formed from Brunswick County on 28 November 1780. The county court first met on 22 February 1781. Subsequent additions were made from Brunswick (1787) and Sussex (1802) Counties. The county courthouse is in the city of Emporia.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>

Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.</p>

          <p> Mr. Avery was a co-partner in a business to buy "blood horses" in England with A. T. Merritt and William H. E. Merritt. The partners hoped to raise horses to compete in races.

Condis was sold for 4500 dollars in Richmond, VA. Lewis was not sold, but retained by the parties.

          <p>Mr. Farley and his wife agreed to lease the Cato Hotel in Hicksford from Benjamin D. Tillar. The parties did not have a written lease. Mr. Tillar tricked Mrs. Farley into signing an agreement with him. The Farleys were sued by Mr. Tillar because they refused to pay more rent and he wanted them to move out of the hotel. During the time Mr. Farley rented the hotel, Mr. Tillar had an addition built to the existing Hotel building. The workmen building the new addition greatly damaged the roof of the existing building. The leaks from the holes in the roof caused damage to the building and the Farley's furniture. The leaks caused damage in the eight rooms that were used as hotel room. In the deposition of W. E. Bailey, he detailed the construction problems of the "Cato Hotel" (which was also called the "Central Hotel.") He statesdwhich rooms had plaster damage, parts missing from the building, problems with the window sashes, etc. Additional depositions were given concerning the problems in the building. Copies of the floor plan and the buildings front elevation are exhibits in this suit.
