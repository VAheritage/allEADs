      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph>Greensville County was named either for Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene, commanding general of the Continental army in the South during part of the Revolutionary War, or for Sir Richard Grenville, leader of the Roanoke Island settlement of 1585. The county was formed from Brunswick County on 28 November 1780. The county court first met on 22 February 1781. Subsequent additions were made from Brunswick (1787) and Sussex (1802) Counties. The county courthouse is in the city of Emporia.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Greensville County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1782-1912, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.</p>
<p>Chancery causes before 1870 contain a large amount of estate suits concerning enslaved Black men, women, and children. While there are several suits concerning the freedom of enslaved individuals, these cases largely represent the perspective of white enslavers and their disputes involving the sale, hiring, financial responsibilities, and legality of ownership of Black individuals. </p>
<p>Chancery causes from the years between 1860-1867 contain a substantial number of instances where enslaved people fled to the Union Army. There are a few cases which reference the successful escape of enslaved individuals, but the majority of cases were brought to court after their capture. The cases are largely concerned with the perspective of the fears of white enslavers, they also provide information about the effect the Civil War had upon the everyday lives of enslaved people. </p>
<p>Chancery causes from the 1830s-1850s contain several instances of disputes over military pensions and bounty land warrants. As veterans of the early wars of the United States began to pass, their families sought the chancery court for either an equitable division or  the rights to the pensions and land warrants given to their deceased ancestors.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>John Avery was a co-partner with A.T. Merritt and William H.E. Merritt in a business to buy "blood horses" [horses of good descent] in England. The partners intended to raise horses to compete in races. On one occasion, Avery went to England, bought one horse and three mares and then had them shipped to the United States. He failed to insure the horses completely.  Unfortunately, the horses were lost at sea and the business suffered. Avery was a co-partner in other ventures to buy horses in England. The answers of William H. D. Merritt, A. T. B. Merritt, and William and Edward Townes provide information about all the ventures involving John Avery. This suit was an attempt to determine the value of Avery's partnership in these ventures so that the money from his part could be used to pay his bills.

After the Transatlantic Slave Trade was legally abolished in 1808, New Orleans became a prominent site for the buying and selling of enslaved individuals.

In the suit, Bailey sought the court's permission to sell Davy, on his children's behalf, to the executor of Nancy Cain's estate. The executor was willing to buy Davy and send him and his family to Africa.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>In his will, Henry Hill left his wife Elizabeth the enslaved people he claimed ownership to at the time, with the order that those enslaved people be emancipated at the time of her death. Crucially, the wording of his will described his wishes for only the enslaved people he was "now in possession of," which left the futures of those enslaved people's descendants uncertain. Henry Hill's heirs fought over the right of legal ownership of those descendants and what followed was a intense deliberation over the legal status (emancipated or enslaved) over the children born of those enslaved by Henry Hill between his death and his wife's death. </p>

          <p>Hubbard Vick was granted a land warrant for his service in the War of 1812. After his death, his land warrant was passed to his minor children, Edmund and Atalanta.

As a result, he asked permission of the court to sell the land warrant on behalf of Vick's children.

The Farleys were sued by Tillar because they refused to pay more rent and he wanted them to move out of the hotel. During the time Pierece Farley rented the hotel, Tillar had an addition built to the existing hotel building. The workmen building the new addition greatly damaged the roof of the existing building and causing leaks. The leaks from the holes in the roof caused damage to the eight rooms used as hotel rooms in the building and the Farley's furniture.  In the deposition of W. E. Bailey, he detailed the construction problems of the "Cato Hotel" (which was also called the "Central Hotel."), providing an extensive report of the damage done during the renovation. Copies of the floor plan and the buildings front elevation are exhibits in this suit.
