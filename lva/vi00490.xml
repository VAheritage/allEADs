         <p>Tredegar Iron Works was chartered in 1837 in Richmond,
         Virginia, to produce high-quality iron products. In 1848
         Joseph R. Anderson purchased the company and developed it into
         one of the most important and largest iron making factories in
         Virginia and the Confederacy. The company produced horseshoes,
         munitions, and railroad products, along with owning several
         furnaces and timber lots. During the Civil War, Tredegar
         produced artillery pieces, cannons, shot, and weapons for the
         Confederacy, including the iron plates for the CSS Virginia
         (Merrimac). After the war the company continued to grow and
         supplied iron bridges, rails, and spikes to rebuild the
         southern railroads.</p>
         <p>As iron gave way to steel in the 1870s and 1880s, Tredegar
         found it did not have the capital necessary to make the
         production conversion. Tredegar continued to make iron
         products, producing munition for the Spanish American War,
         World War I, and World War II. Spikes, horseshoes, rail
         fastenings, and car wheels were constant sellers and led to
         expanded facilities. In 1957 the company sold its Richmond
         plant to the Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company, and moved
         some of its rolling mill equipment to Chesterfield County,
         Virginia. In 1986 operation of the rolling mill in
         Chesterfield County was discontinued and the machinery was
         sold to the Cleveland Track Material in Cleveland, Ohio. In
         2003 the Tredegar National Civil War Center Foundation was
         created to operate a museum on the original site of the
         foundry in Richmond, Virginia.</p>
         <p>Joseph Reid Anderson (1813-1892), was the youngest of nine
         children of William and Anna Thomas Anderson of Botetourt
         County, Virginia. He graduated West Point in 1836 and worked
         as an engineer in Virginia. He married Sally Archer in 1837,
         daughter of Dr. Robert and Frances Williamson Archer. By 1841,
         he had acquired an interest in the Tredegar Iron Works in
         Richmond which supplied iron products to railroads and the
         U.S. government, and he became owner of the company in 1848.
         When the South seceded, Anderson offered his services to the
         Confederate Government as an infantry officer and was
         commissioned a brigadier-general in September 1861, serving
         meritoriously in North Carolina and Virginia. After being
         wounded at the battle of Frazier's Farm in 1862, Anderson
         resigned in mid-July to return to Tredegar Iron Works where
         his talent was needed more than on the battlefield. The
         company operated throughout the war, but after the surrender
         of Richmond, the U.S. government confiscated Tredegar Iron
         Works. Upon Anderson's request to President Johnson for a
         pardon in the fall of 1865, the Works were returned to him.
         Anderson continued to head Tredegar Iron Works and remained
         active in state, city, and local affairs until his death in
         1892.</p>
