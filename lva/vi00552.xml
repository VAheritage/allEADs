      <p>William Fanning Wickham was born 23 November 1793 in
         Richmond, Virginia, to John Wickham (1763-1839) and Mary Smith
         Fanning (1775-1799). A lawyer and planter, he resided at
         Hickory Hill in Hanover County, Virginia. William F. Wickham
         married Anne Butler Carter (1797-1868) 9 December 1819, and
         they had five children. William F. Wickham died 31 July 1880
         in Hanover County and was buried at Hickory Hill. His son
         Williams Carter Wickham was born 21 September 1820 in
         Richmond, Virginia. He attended the University of Virginia.
         After graduation, he became a lawyer. Williams C. Wickham
         represented Hanover County in the House of Delegates in
         1849-1850 and in 1859-1861. Wickham also served in the
         Virginia secession convention of 1861 as a Unionist until
         Abraham Lincoln's call for volunteers and the beginning of the
         Civil War. Wickham enlisted and eventually became colonel of
         the 4th Virginia cavalry and then a brigadier-general in the
         Confederate army. He also served in the Confederate House of
         Representatives from 1864 to 1865. After the war, Wickham
         represented Hanover and Caroline Counties in the state Senate
         from 1885 to 1888. He also was president of the Virginia
         Central Railroad and of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad.
         Wickham married Lucy Penn Taylor (1830-1913) 11 January 1848
         and they had four children. Wickham died in Richmond 23 July
         1888 and was buried at Hickory Hill. Edmund Fanning Wickham
         was born 30 July 1796 in Richmond to John and Mary Smith
         Fanning Wickham, and therefore was William Fanning Wickham's
         brother. Edmund lived at "Rocky Mills" in Hanover County. He
         married Lucy Carter (1799-1835) 28 November 1822 and they had
         six children. Edmund Fanning Wickham died 25 September 1843
         and was buried at Rocky Mills.</p>
