<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>William Fanning Wickham was born 23 November 1793 in Richmond, Virginia, to John Wickham (1763-1839) and Mary Smith Fanning (1775-1799). A lawyer and planter, he resided at Hickory Hill in Hanover County, Virginia. William F. Wickham married Anne Butler Carter (1797-1868) 9 December 1819, and they had five children. William F. Wickham died 31 July 1880 in Hanover County and was buried at Hickory Hill. His son Williams Carter Wickham was born 21 September 1820 in Richmond, Virginia. He attended the University of Virginia. After graduation, he became a lawyer. Williams C. Wickham represented Hanover County in the House of Delegates in 1849-1850 and in 1859-1861. Wickham also served in the Virginia secession convention of 1861 as a Unionist until Abraham Lincoln's call for volunteers and the beginning of the Civil War. Wickham enlisted and eventually became colonel of the 4th Virginia cavalry and then a brigadier-general in the Confederate army. He also served in the Confederate House of Representatives from 1864 to 1865. After the war, Wickham represented Hanover and Caroline Counties in the state Senate from 1885 to 1888. He also was president of the Virginia Central Railroad and of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. Wickham married Lucy Penn Taylor (1830-1913) 11 January 1848 and they had four children. Wickham died in Richmond 23 July 1888 and was buried at Hickory Hill. Edmund Fanning Wickham was born 30 July 1796 in Richmond to John and Mary Smith Fanning Wickham, and therefore was William Fanning Wickham's brother. Edmund lived at "Rocky Mills" in Hanover County. He married Lucy Carter (1799-1835) 28 November 1822 and they had six children. Edmund Fanning Wickham died 25 September 1843 and was buried at Rocky Mills.
