<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The position of Solicitor General was created by an act passed by the General Assembly during its session begun in October 1780.  The solicitor settled accounts for all debts due the commonwealth, examined the auditor's accounts, and composed lists of taxes raised and the manner of their expenditure.  He was authorized to sue for the recovery of delinquent taxes.  On 25 November 1791 the General Assembly passed an act terminating the office and the auditor of public accounts assumed its duties on 1 January 1792.  Leighton Wood served as Solictor General.</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Solicitor General records, 1764-1794, include accounts, correspondence, ledgers, letterbooks, returns and settlements.</p>



<p>The records are arranged into 5 series. This collection consists of several Auditor of Public Accounts (APA) accessions that, while identified separately, all pertain to the same category of records. Since the specific APA accession numbers have been used and referenced over the years it was decided that each series would reference it's specific APA number, but one finding aid would describe the entire collection.</p>

<p>This volume records the dates of payment of the duties on rum and other alcoholic beverages imported by individuals and companies through the Norfolk Customhouse before the revolutionary war.  The ledger also seemed to have been used after the war by the commission appointed to settle the claims of British merchants against American citizens.  Later notations in the hand of Leighton Wood, solicitor general, indicate the current residence of the person or company that had paid duties.  Indexed.</p>

<p>Peter Penet records, 1781-1782 contain letters to and from Penet regarding his activities as agent, copies of bills of lading and exchange, and correspondence concerning his dismissal and the collection of the debt due the state.  Peter Penet served as agent for Virginia in France during the revolutionary war.  He was dismissed from the position when a bill of exchange for ten thousand livres was returned for nonpayment.  Because the state had already paid this bill, the matter was turned over to the solicitor general for settlement and collection.</p>
