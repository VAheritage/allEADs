<head>Biographical Information
</head>

The solicitor settled accounts for all debts due the commonwealth, examined the auditor's accounts, and composed lists of taxes raised and the manner of their expenditure.  He wa authorized to sue for the recovery of delinquent taxes.  On 25 November 1791 the General Assembly passed an act terminating the office and the auditor of public accounts assumed its duties on 1 January 1792.</p>

<head>Scope and Content

<p>The Solicitor General records, 1764-1794, include accounts, correspondence, ledgers, letterbooks, returns and settlements.</p>

<p>XX</p>

<p>The records are arranged into 3 series. This collection consists of several Auditor of Public Accounts (APA) accessions that, while identified separately, all pertain to the same category of records. Since the specific APA accession numbers have been used and referenced over the years it was decided that each series would reference it's specific APA number, but one finding aid would describe the entire collection.</p>

<p>Peter Penet records, 1781-1782 contain letters to and from Penet regarding his activities as agent, copies of bills of lading and exchange, and correspondence concerning his dismissal and the collection of the debt due the state.  Peter Penet served as agent for Virginia in France during the revolutionary war.  He was dismissed from the position when a bill of exchange for ten thousand livres was returned for nonpayment.  Because the state had already paid this bill, the matter was turned over to the solicitor general for settlement and collection.</p>
