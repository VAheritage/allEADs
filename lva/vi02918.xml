      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Cumberland County was named for William Augustus, duke of Cumberland, third son of King George II. It was formed from Goochland County in 1749. The county seat is Cumberland.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Cumberland County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1750-1912, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.
</p>
      <p>Commonly found surnames among the plaintiffs and defendants include Allen, Amos, Anderson, Armistead, Austin, Ballow, Barker, Baskerville, Blanton, Boatwright (also spelled Boatright), Booker, Bosher, Bradley, Brown, Bryant, Carrington, Carter, Clarke, Coleman, Cox, Crenshaw, Crowder, Cunningham, Daniel, Davenport, Davis, Deane, Dowdy, Eggleston, Flippen (also spelled Flippin), Ford, Fuqua, Gibson, Gilliam, Glover, Goodman, Gray, Harris, Harrison, Haskins, Hatcher, Hill, Hobson, Holman, Hudgens (also spelled Hudgins), Hughes, Isbell, Johns, Johnson, Jones, Langhorne, Lee, Ligon, Lipscomb (also spelled Lipscombe), Martin, Mayo, McLaurine, Meador, Meredith, Miller, Montague, Page, Palmore, Parker, Parrish, Phillips, Powell, Powers, Price, Raine, Ransone (also spelled Ranson), Reynolds, Richardson, Robertson, Robinson, Sanderson, Scott, Scruggs, Sims, Smith, Spears, Spencer, Stegar (also spelled Steger), Stratton, Swann (also spelled Swan), Talley, Taylor, Thompson, Thornton, Trent, Walker, Walton, Watkins, Wilkinson, Williams, Wilson, Womack, Woodson, and Wright.
