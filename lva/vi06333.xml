<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories. </p>
<p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Clarke County was named for Lieutenant Colonel George Rogers Clark, who commanded the Virginia forces that secured control of the Northwest Territory for Virginia during the Revolution. He spelled his name without the terminal e. The county was formed from Frederick County in 1836. The county seat is Berryville.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Clarke County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1838-1912, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint, decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics. </p>
<p>Clarke Chancery causes, contain a large number of cases concerning debts and estates where property is central to the activity of the case. Many of these cases prior to 1865 contain a substantial amount of information concerning enslaved Black men, women, and children. These cases largely represent the perspective of white enslavers and their disputes involving the sale, hiring, financial responsibilities, and legality of ownership of Black individuals. </p>

Consists of subcontractors of the Central Improvement Company who contracted for the construction and completion of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad extending from the Potomac River at or near Sheperdstown to the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad at or near the Big Lick Station. Whole of said Railroad to be completed on or before 10 August 1872, 2 years from original contract. Road work was suspended in September 1873 and never resumed.

Cause was originally filed in Warren County Circuit Court and removed to Clarke County in Oct. 1878. In further causes, individual stockholders on behalf of the Central Improvement Company are suing the law firm that they employed to settle the debts and selling of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad Company. Related causes are found in the circuit courts of Roanoke, Virginia. Jefferson County, West Virginia and Washington County, Maryland. The Shenandoah Valley Railroad was to be built by the Central Improvement Company in the states of Virginia, West Virginia &amp; Maryland [SEE ALSO: 1900-021, 1900-022, 1900-023, 1910-019].

        <scopecontent>
          <p>Plaintiff is the holder of seven bonds executed by the County of Clarke for the extension of the railroad into the county. Plaintiff seeks payment. Originally, the defendant was known as the Alexandria, Loudoun &amp; Hampshire Rail Road Company which then became the Washington &amp; Ohio Rail Road. After a lawsuit in Richmond City, Henry Lewis, etc. v. Washington &amp; Ohio Rail Road, the railroad's name became the Washington, Ohio &amp; Western Rail Road Co. The railroad was supposed to extend from Alexandria to Clarke County by way of the town of Berryville (the county seat). The railroad, however, never extended beyond Loudoun County, as a portion was destroyed during the Civil War. The crossbill filed by the County of Clarke in the Richmond City suit is included with this cause. Eventually, the plaintiff transferred her bonds to Charles J. Philbin of Baltimore City.
