</head>
	<p>The office of the state agent and commissary of stores was created by an ordinance passed by the third revolutionary convention on August 21, 1775. In 1777 the office was divided, and different persons were appointed state agent and commissary of stores. Initially the Public Stores were directed by the Commissary of Stores whose duties were closely related to those of the State Agent. Working under the authorizations from the Board of War and later the Commissioner of the War Office, the Commissary distributed all stores under his charge.  The office also received supplies imported from abroad or purchased by the State Agent.  William Aylett held the double position of State Agent and Commissary of Stores between 1775 and 1777.  Upon his resignation, two offices were created, with William Armistead being appointed to the latter in 1777.  He served as Commissary of Stores until the office was abolished in February 1782, and was responsible for the storage and distribution of supplies acquired by the state agent's office for the troops in the Illinois country, Pennsylvania, and in Virginia. After February 1782, the commissary's functions were assumed first by the Commercial Agent, being served at the time by David Ross, and taken over by William Hay in May 1782.  The Public Stores wer placed under the State Quartermaster General, Henry Young, in Oct 1782, when the office of the Commercial Agent was discontinued.</p>
