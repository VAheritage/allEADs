<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>John William Jones was born 25 September 1836 in Louisa County, Virginia, to Francis Willian Jones and Ann Pendleton Ashby Jones. Jones attended the University of Virginia, graduating in 1859, then attended the
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Greenville, South Carolina. Ordained in 1860, he returned to Louisa County to preach at Little River Baptist Church. When the Civil War began, he enlisted as a private in
the 13th Virginia Regiment, then became regimental chaplain, then a missionary chaplain to the army. Jones conducted revivals in the army throughout the war. After the Civil War ended, he preached at the Baptist
Church in Lexington, Virginia, and was chaplain at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University). He served churches in Ashland, Virginia, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina, as well as serving as chaplain
at the University of Virginia and the University of North Carolina. He was the secretary of the Southern Historical Society from 1875 to 1887, and he edited and wrote several works on the war and on Robert E. Lee.
Jones was chaplain-general of the United Confederate Veterans from 1890 to 1909. Jones married Judith Page Helm in December 1860, and they had five children. Jones died in Columbus, Georgia, 17 March 1909.
