<head>Processing Information
</head>
<p>Amherst County Apprenticeship indentures of Black and multiracial individuals were removed from the Amherst (Va.) Deeds [under accession 53740] by Ed Jordan in 2023. Lydia Neuroth later indexed the indentures pertaining to Black and multiracial individuals for the purposes of digitizing them for the digital project Virginia Untold: The African American Narrative.

<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type</emph>: In 1765, the General Assembly established that illegitimate children of "woman servants, Negroes, white women by Negroes were to be bound out" until the age of 21 for males and 18 for females. In the late eighteenth century, the General Assembly established the Overseers of the Poor, an appointed body that provided food, clothing, shelter, and medical treatment for people who were too poor to support themselves or too ill to provide for their basic needs. They also bound out children whose parents could not support them and those who were orphaned through apprenticeship contracts. These agreements arranged for white children to be taught a trade or domestic skills as well as educated in reading, writing, and arithmetic. In 1805, the General Assembly amended the previous act to no longer require the master of "black or mulatto orphans" to teach reading, writing, or arithmetic, with the intent that this would prevent Black children from learning these skills.
</p>
<p><emph render="bold">Locality History Note:</emph> Amherst County was named for Major General Jeffery Amherst, British commander in North America during the latter part of the French and Indian War and governor of Virginia from 1759 to 1768. It was formed from Albemarle County in 1761. Islands in the Fluvanna (now the James) River were added in 1770.</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Amherst (Va.) Apprenticeship Indentures, 1806, consists of contracts or agreements binding out white, Black, or multiracial children, sometimes those who were orphaned, to learn a particular trade or craft. These indentures may be written agreements between the family of the apprentice and those responsible for the indentured. In many cases this includes the direct involvement of the Overseers of the Poor. They typically contain the name of the person or institution binding out, the person to whom bound, the name of the person being indentured, the length of the apprenticeship, and the responsibilities of the person taking on the indenture.
</p>
<p>This record set includes only two indentures. These indentures are both dated 21 July 1806 and bind out Moses Smith and Rueben Smith, both young Free Black children, to John Hawkins, a white man, to learn the trade of carpentry. </p>
