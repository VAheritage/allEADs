      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>The following is a brief outline of the Mutual Assurance Society's history. The history 
of the company has been the subject of several publications, which should be consulted for 
more in-depth presentations: John B. Danforth and Herbert A. Claiborne, "Historical Sketch 
of the Mutual Assurance Society of Virginia, From its Organization in 1794 to 1879," (W.E. 
Jones, 1879); and Richard Love, "Founded Upon Benevolence: A Bicentennial History of the 
Mutual Assurance Society of Virginia," (The Valentine: 1994).
</p>
      <p>The Mutual Assurance Society against Fire on Buildings, of the State of Virginia, was 
incorporated by the General Assembly on 22 December 1794. The plan of the society was 
suggested by William Frederick Ast, a Prussian then residing in Richmond, and is alleged to 
have been modeled after a system of mutual guarantee introduced by Frederick the Great.</p>
      <p>As required by the act of incorporation, a subscription of three million dollars was 
necessary before the charter could be carried into effect. As a result, the organizational 
meeting of the society was not held until 24 December 1795. At that meeting, a 
constitution, rules, and regulations were adopted and officers selected. The general office 
of the society was to be in Richmond, Virginia. Management was to be by the president and 
directors, while the principal agent and cashier-general were charged with administrative 
duties. The following officers were selected: William Foushee, President; James Bradder, 
James Brown, Jacob J. Cohen, Andrew Dunscomb, William Duval, Robert Mitchell, George 
Pickett, and Bushrod Washington, Directors for Richmond and vicinity; Robert Bolling, 
Director for Petersburg; George French, Director for Fredericksburg; Alexander S. Clair, 
Director for Staunton; Jonah Thompson, Director for Alexandria; John Petyon, Director for 
Winchester, Thomas Newton, Director for Norfolk; Jacquelin Ambler, Cashier-General; and 
William F. Ast, Principal agent. The society eventually insured property in Virginia, West 
Virginia (until 1868), and the District of Columbia. Policies began to be written March 
1796. One of the first policies was for John Marshall, the first chief justice of the U.S. 
Supreme Court; other early clients included Thomas Jefferson, "Light-Horse" Harry Lee, 
James Monroe, and Bushrod Washington.</p>
      <p>Insurance offered by the society was against all losses and damages occasioned 
accidentally by fire. Rates of hazard were determined by the material composition of the 
buildings, by the users to which the buildings were put, and by what may be kept in them. 
Mills, playhouses, liveries, and buildings containing machinery propelled by steam or in 
which combustible articles were stored could be insured only by special contract. 
Revaluations of insured property were required every seven years or whenever additions were 
made to a policy.</p>
      <p>Until 1819, the society returned to policy holders the interest accumulated on its 
reserve fund in excess of the amount deemed necessary to pay annual claims for losses and 
damages. When costs exceeded income, the society was authorized to require members to pay 
quotas, the amount depending on the sum insured and the rate of the hazard. Insured 
property was considered security and could be sold to obtain the quotas. Annual quotas were 
not regularly required until 1809.</p>
      <p>During its history, the society made numerous revisions in its constitution. In 1805, 
the number of directors was reduced, and in 1809 the offices of president, cashier-general, 
and the directors were abolished. In their place a committee was to be appointed by the 
annual general meeting. While property located in towns and rural areas was initially 
insured alike, a constitutional change in 1805 established town and country branches. Funds 
were divided between the two branches and the premiums, quotas, and claims were kept 
separately. Because of the heavy losses sustained by the country branch, no new insurance 
of rural property was issued after 15 August 1818. The country branch was eventually 
abolished in March 1822.</p>
      <p>Up to the Civil War, the society was financially secure and prosperous. Although war 
risks were not taken by the society and any damage caused by invasion was not covered by 
the assurance, the financial crisis caused by inflation, currency depreciation, and the 
lost of investments with the fall of the Confederacy left the society without a dollar in 
money. However, the society reserve fund, required by law, enabled it to recover rapidly 
from the effects of the war.</p>
      <p>In May 1905 work was completed on a new nine story office building for the Mutual 
Assurance Society, located in downtown Richmond. The company survived World War I and World 
War II intact, even abating quotas for its members in 1945. During the tenure of G. Moffett 
King Sr. and Jr., the society made several changes in the types of policies it wrote. 
Coverage was extended and homeowner's insurance was offered, which eventually became the 
society's primary insurance product. The articles of incorporation were amended in 1982 to 
change the name from The Mutual Assurance Society Against Fire on Buildings of the State of 
Virginia, to its present name, Mutual Assurance Society of Virginia. In 1991 the offices in 
downtown Richmond were sold and the company relocated to the west end of Richmond. After 
210 years the company continues to prosper in Virginia, remaining the oldest incorporated 
business in Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The Mutual Assurance Society Records are organized into two distinct groupings, General 
Business Records (Accession 28135) and Declarations and Revaluations of Assurance 
(Accession 30177). This finding aid is for the Declarations and Revaluations of Assurance 
only. </p>
      <p>The records consist of 259 volumes of individual applications- called declarations and 
revaluations of assurance- dating from 1796 to 1966. Each printed form is numbered and is 
designated as a new policy or a revaluation. Policies include the name of the insured, 
place of residence, location of the insured property (with references to contiguous 
property), the name of the occupant of the property, a description and estimated value of 
each structure insured, and the date and the signature of the insured. An appraiser's 
statement regarding the value of the property is also included on each policy. At the 
bottom of each policy appears a sketch of the insured property. In most instances the 
sketches are rough outlines of the buildings as if viewed from above. The roofing material 
and distance from streets and from other structures are also noted. Agents sketched and 
compiled structural details about many of the great houses owned by Virginia's wealthy 
planters and entrepreneurs, but they also documented modest cottages, urban slave-quarters, 
and a variety of rural and urban outbuildings. Revaluations of insured property were 
required every seven years (or whenever additions were made to a policy), so succeeding 
declarations often showed additions to the original building, new outbuildings, and new 
uses for old buildings.</p>
      <p>In the earlier volumes, up until Volume 61, there is much overlap between the years and the policy numbers are not truly sequential. For example Volume 1 includes Declarations 1-130, Volume 2 Declarations 131-186, but Volume 3 includes Declarations 1-137. Also there is much overlap with the years, for example Volume 60 includes the years 1854 to 1866, while Volume 61 contains policies for the year 1805. It is unknown why these discrepencies occurred.</p>
      <p>Of note is a policy book, 1796-1803, containing copies of insurance 
policies issued in Chesterfield and Henrico Counties and Richmond, Virginia. Each policy 
contains the name of the insurer, brief description of the property, and the sum for which 
insured. Declaration numbers also appear. All policies are signed by William Foushee, 
president, and William F. Ast, principal agent. Also included is a policy book, 1798-1803, 
containing declarations for insuring goods and implements.</p>

      </p>
      <p>An index done by the Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission is available for policies, 1796-1867 (Misc. reels 776-780, Accession 30790). The index is arranged alphabetically by city and county, 
plantations, estates, taverns, hotels, and other buildings. Additionally, a database was created by the Center for Historic Preservation at Mary Washington College for the policies, 1796-1867. This database is available on the Library's web site. <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/mutual.asp">Click here</extref> to access database as well as the Mutual Assurance Society Research Notes Number 24.
</p>







      <p>Another index is available for the policies, 1796-1821 (Misc. reel 433, Accession 26199). This index is arranged alphabetically by surname. The index is available on either microfilm or bound photocopies. </p>
      <p>For policies dated after 1867, an index is not available. Researchers must consult the city and county Sanborn maps located in the collection and find the corresponding declaration number. Included are Sanborn maps for: Alexandria (1931); Charlottesville (1929-1959); Fredericksburg (1927); Harrisonburg, Leesburg, Smithfield, and Warrenton (1907-1926); Lexington (1930); Norfolk (1928-1960); Petersburg (1915-1955); 
Richmond (1952); South Richmond (1952); Staunton (1929); Suffolk (1920, 1926-1960); Williamsburg (1933); and Winchester (1927).</p>
      <p>The finding aid includes more descriptive information for Volumes 1-138 (1796-1867), 
including lists of cities and counties insured for each volume. These earlier volumes were 
indexed, while the remaining volumes (Volumes 139-259) were not. The finding aid lists only 
the years and policy number for Volumes 139-259 (1867-1966).</p>
