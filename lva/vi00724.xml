      <p>Henry Alexander Wise was born 3 December 1806 in Accomack
         County, Virginia, to Major John Wise (d. 1812) and Sallie
         Cropper Wise (d. 1813). Wise attended Washington College in
         Pennsylvania, graduating in 1825. He then studied law under
         Henry St. George Tucker in Winchester, Virginia. Admitted to
         the Virginia bar in 1828, Wise followed his future wife and
         family to Nashville, Tennessee. He practiced law in Nashville
         for two years before returning to Accomack in 1830. Elected to
         the United States House of Representatives in 1833, Wise
         served until 1844. Wise was appointed Minister to Brazil in
         1844, and served in that position until 1847. He represented
         the Eastern Shore counties of Accomack and Northampton in the
         Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850-1851, and
         represented Princess Anne County in the Virginia Secession
         Convention of 1861. Wise was elected governor of Virginia in
         1855 and served from 1856 to 1860, during which time he met
         with John Brown (1800-1859) after the latter's failed raid in
         Harper's Ferry, (West) Virginia. During the Civil War, Wise
         raised troops and was appointed a brigadier general. After the
         war, he practiced law in Richmond, Virginia. Wise married
         three times: first, to Ann Elizabeth Jennings (1808-1837) of
         Nashville, Tennessee, 8 October 1828; second, to Sarah
         Sergeant (d. 1850) of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, November
         1840; and third, to Mary Elizabeth Lyons (1817-1901) of
         Richmond, Virginia, 1 November 1853. He fathered fourteen
         children, only seven of whom reached maturity. Wise died 12
         September 1876, and was buried in Hollywood Cemetery in
         Richmond.</p>
