</head>
	<p>When it abolished the Board of War in 1780, the General Assembly established the position of Commissioner of the War Office at its May 1780 session to replace it. The position was to be appointed by the governor, with advice of council (Chapter XXIV). The War Office was created to oversee recruits' vouchers, officers' commissions, returns from county lieutenants, military claims to land warrants, and pension certificates during the Revolutionary War.</p>

	<p>A year later the powers of the Commissioner were extended (Chapter XV, May 1781).</p>

	<p>The office was abolished in Oct 1782 in an attempt at economy at the close of hostilities and the duties appertaining thereto were transferred to the executive or his designee (Chapter XIV).</p>

<p>Colonel George Muter, the first commissioner, resigned his position on March 22, 1781, and was replaced by Colonel William Davies.</p>
