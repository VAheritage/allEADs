<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Caroline County was formed in 1728 from Essex, King and Queen and King William counties. Additional parts of King and Queen county were added in 1742 and 1762. It was named for Caroline of Anspach, consort of George II.
</p>
<p>Most loose records and deed books prior to 1836 and will books prior to 1853 were stolen, mutilated, and/or destroyed by Union troops who ransacked the courthouse in May 1864. A near-complete run of order books exists.
</p>
<p>Prior to 1853, when the Commonwealth began recording vital statistics, Virginia marriages were recorded at the county or city level. Beginning in 1661, in order to be married by license, the groom was required to go before the county clerk and give bond with security that there was no lawful reason to prevent the marriage. The license, issued then by the clerk, was given to the minister who performed the service.  Written consent from a parent or guardian was needed for individuals younger than twenty-one years.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Marriage Records, 1786-1853, are comprised of two major record categories--marriage registers and marriage bonds--found in four volumes (Parts 1-4.) The first volume (Part 1) covering pages 1-165, 1786-1853, is divided into three separate sections with marriage registers and marriage bonds. Pages 1-39, 1795-1844, record the date of the marriage bond, the names of both parties, the names of the parents or guardians present and the names of the security or witnesses in attendance. Pages 41-53, 1852-1853, record the same information as found in the first forty pages but also includes the name of the minister who performed the
marriage ceremony. Pages 53-54 record the same information found in the first forty pages and note additonal register entries for 1819. Pages 55- 58, 1797- 1851, record the date of the marriage, the names of both parties, the minister's name and the religious denomination of the minister. Another section of this volume, covering pages 59-107, is an alphabetized (A-Y) and chronological (by month and year) register of all parties married and by whom they were married from 1786-1853. The last section of this volume, covering pages 108-165, records marriage bonds from 1821-1824.
</p>
<p>The second volume (Part 2) covering pages 166-330, 1824-1835, records mainly marriage bonds. The third volume (Part 3) covering pages 331-559, 1835-1844, records mainly marriage bonds as well. The fourth volume (Part 4) covering pages 560-786, 1844-1851, is an exclusive collection of marriage bonds.
</p>
<p>An Index to Marriage Records, 1786-1853, is a separate volume. This index contains the first and last names of both parties. It is arranged alphabetically from A-Y and in addition, lists alternate spellings of last names.
