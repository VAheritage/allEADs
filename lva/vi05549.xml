      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>The Virginia Commission on Youth was established by the 1989 General Assembly (statutes §30-174 and §30-175). The formation of the Commission was a legislative response to a two-year study examining the issues related to services to chronic status offenders. Virginia code mandates the Commission "to study and provide recommendations addressing the needs of and services to the Commonwealth's youth and families." Enacted in 1989, the Commission began operations in 1991.
</p>

<p>The Commission on Youth is a standing legislative commission of the Virginia General Assembly. It is comprised of twelve members: six Delegates appointed by the Speaker of the House, three Senators appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and three citizens appointed by the Governor.</p>

<p>The Commission on Youth provides a legislative forum in which complex issues related to Virginia youth and their families may be explored and resolved. The Commission provides a bipartisan forum for complex issues related to youth and their families. It is responsible for monitoring developments in federal, state and local policies and laws which impact youth and their families, while also contributing to the General Assembly's ability to make sound policy decisions based on well-studied and reasoned recommendations. The Commission assists General Assembly members in developing bills on study issues which reflect consensus among key agencies, organizations and special interests. The Commission also conducts legislative studies on issues related to youth and their families, and serves as a resource for constituent concerns and the general public. Members of the Commission often speak to professional associations, civic and community groups about the legislative process, state and national policy issues impacting youth, and specific topical areas, as well as educate interested groups on Commission studies. Members may also serve on varied private and governmental task forces convened on children's issues.</p>

<p>Each year the Virginia Commission on Youth compiles a summary of legislative action impacting youth and their families across the Commonwealth. The Commission also produces a yearly newsletter, the General Assembly Overview, which outlines the year's legislative and gubernatorial actions affecting children and their families.</p>
