      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Amherst County was formed in 1761 from Albemarle County. The county was named for Major General Jeffery Amherst, British commander in North America during the latter part of the French and Indian War and governor of Virginia from 1759-1768.
</p>
      <p>Prior to 1853, when the Commonwealth began recording vital statistics, Virginia marriages were recorded at the county or city level. Beginning in 1661, in order to be married by license, the groom was required to go before the county clerk and give bond with security that there was no lawful reason to prevent the marriage. The license, issued then by the clerk, was given to the minister who performed the service.  Written consent from a parent or guardian was needed for individuals younger than twenty-one years. Ministers' returns were required by law beginning in 1780, so all marriages from that date would be of record in the county court clerk's office.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Marriage Register, 1763-1854, is divided into a number of sections. The first section covering pages 1-429, 1763-1853, records the date of the marriage bond, the names of both parties, the names of the parents or guardians present, the names of the security or witnesses in attendance and occasionally the name of the minister performing the ceremony. The next section, covering pages 430-431, lists undated miscellaneous consents that were found in the marriage bond papers. These consents record the names of both parties, the names of the parents or guardians present and the names of the security or witnesses in attendance.
Another section covering pages 432-434, 1795-1816, deals with marriage bonds. This section records the date of the bond, the minister who performed the ceremony, the religious denomination of the minister and the security or witnesses in attendance. An additional section covering pages 436-447, 1795-1854, deals with ministers' returns. These returns record the date of the marriage bond, the names of both parties, the religious denomination of the minister and the minister's name.
</p>
      <p>The last section covering pages 450-497, 1792-1853 is actually a photostatic copy of a manuscript book containing a register of marriage returns. This book is also divided into a number of sections. The first section covering pages 450-456, 1792-1797, contains lists of marriages returned by officials (ministers or court clerks). Another section pages 457-464, 1798-late 1820s, records the names of both parties, by whom the marriage was celebrated and the date of the marriage. The last section pages 465-497, 1828-1853, records the names of both parties, the date of the marriage license, the date of the marriage and the minister who performed the ceremony.
</p>
      <p>An Index to Marriage Register, 1763-1854, is a separate volume. This typescript index contains the first and last names of both parties. It is arranged alphabetically from A-Z.  Alternate spellings of last names are included with a "see also" reference following the standard spelling.  Occasionally, this volume also lists alternate names of individuals (aliases) in parentheses.
