<head>Processing Information
</head>
<p>Orange County (Va.) Certificates of Importation were previously described with the Orange County (Va.) Free and Enslaved Records but were removed to the present Orange County (Va.) Certificates of Importation, 1812-1815 for discoverability purposes.</p>
<p>These records have been scanned and indexed by LVA staff for the purposes of digitizing them for the digital project Virginia Untold: The African American Narrative.</p>
<p> It is believed the ceritificates of importations currently in this collection were removed from the Orange County (Va.) Judgments and processed by Jim Watkins around 2009. </p>

<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Context of Record Type: </emph>In 1778, Governor Patrick Henry enacted legislation preventing importation of enslaved people into the commonwealth. Those that did bring their enslaved people were required to register them with the county court and sign a certificate of importation agreeing that they were not bringing enslaved people into the commonwealth with the intent to sell. The enslaved person is sometimes named, but not always, and occasionally information is given as to age, birthdate, and the state from which the individuals were moving. According to Section 3 of the act "every slave imported into this commonwealth contrary to the true intent and meaning of this act, shall upon such importation become free." By this clause, those enslaved people who were brought into Virginia illegally could pursue their freedom in the local courts.
</p>
<p><title render="bold">Locality History Note: </title>Orange County, according to most accounts, was named for William of Orange, the Dutch prince who became King William III of England in 1688. It is more probable, however, that it was named for William IV, prince of Orange-Nassau, who married Anne, eldest daughter of King George II, in 1734-the year that Orange County was formed from Spotsylvania County. </p>
