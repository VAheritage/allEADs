         <head>Historical Information</head>
         <p>On April 25, 1898, the United States declared war on Spain.
         Immediately, the Secretary of War telegraphed J. Hodge Tyler,
         the Governor of Virginia, stating that three regiments of
         twelve companies of infantry were required for the war effort.
         The three regiments consisted of four companies from the 1st
         Regiment Infantry, eight companies from the 2nd Regiment
         Infantry, nine companies from the 3rd Regiment Infantry, eight
         companies from the 4th Regiment Infantry, two companies of the
         3rd Battalion Infantry, and two companies of the 4th Battalion
         Infantry. With the addition of three new companies organized
         in Fairfax, Wytheville, and Lynchburg, these thirty-six
         companies comprised the three regiments which were designated
         the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Virginia Infantry. Later, another
         regiment, designated the 6th Virginia Infantry, was created to
         fulfill the President's additional call for volunteers. The
         1st and 2nd Battalions Infantry, consisting of colored
         soldiers, were mustered into this regiment.</p>
         <p>A peace agreement was reached between the United States and
         Spain in August 1898 before any Virginia regiment made it
         overseas. The 4th Infantry, however, took part in occupation
         duties in Cuba and mustered out of service on April 27, 1899.
         The 2nd Infantry mustered out of service in Richmond in
         December 1898, the 3rd Infantry mustered out in November, and
         the 6th Infantry mustered out at Macon, Georgia, in January
         1899.</p>
