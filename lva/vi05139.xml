<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Hampton was located in Elizabeth City County, which is now extinct. It takes its name from Hampton Creek, earlier called Southampton River in honor of the earl of Southampton, an important figure in the Virginia Company of London. An Indian town stood on the site in 1607, when Captain John Smith visited the area. The colonists established a village there in 1610 and a trading post in 1630. Hampton was established by an act of assembly in 1680 and was designated as a port of entry in 1705. It was first incorporated as a town in March 1849, but the act was repealed the following December. It was incorporated again in 1852, but the act of incorporation was repealed in 1860. The General Assembly incorporated the town of Hampton in 1887 for a third time, and it became a city by court order on 4 March 1908. It was greatly enlarged on 1 July 1952 by a merger with Elizabeth City County and the town of Phoebus; the county and town thereby became extinct.
</p>
<p>Elizabeth City County was named for Elizabeth, daughter of King James I, and was one of the original shires, or counties, first enumerated in 1634.It became extinct on 1 July 1952 when it was incorporated into the city of Hampton, which was the county seat. </p>

<p>Records were burned and/or destroyed during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Additional records were burned on April 3, 1865, in Richmond, where they had been moved for safekeeping during the Civil War. A few pre-Civil War volumes such as deed books, will books, and order books exist.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Hampton (Va.) Health and Medical Records 1899, consists of one folder of Smallpox Epidemic Records containing a record of smallpox vaccinations performed in Elizabeth City County and the city of Hampton by  Dr. D.H. Worthington due to an 1899 outbreak of smallpox in the Tidewater area. The epidemic resulted in controversial compulsory vaccinations and a travel quarantine, as a printed article pasted within the record indicates some reluctance on the part of Black persons to trust the motive behind a government-mandated vaccine.
