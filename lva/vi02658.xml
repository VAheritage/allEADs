      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
      <p>Northampton County was named probably for the English county, of which Obedience Robins, a prominent early resident of the Eastern Shore, was a native. The county, which originally included all of the peninsula south of Maryland and which was one of the eight shires, or counties, first enumerated in 1634, was first called Accomack. The General Assembly changed the name to Northampton County in 1643. Accomack County was created from Northampton County about 1663, but in October 1670, the General Assembly temporarily reunited the two counties as Northampton County. In November 1673, Accomack County was again separated from Northampton. The county seat is Eastville.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Northampton County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1721-1912, are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
      <p>Chancery cases are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>  John Carpenter, Sr. wrote his will on 18 December 1803. He left a widow Lucy, and children Dicke (Dickie), Azel G., Samuel, Betsy and Leah F. Carpenter.  Azel died without writing a will. Dicke wrote a will before he died and left his share of his father's slaves to his sisters Leah and Elizabeth, wife of Arthur B. Upshur. This cause concerns the division of Azel and Dicke's share of their father John Carpenter, Sr.'s slaves among their mother and brother and sisters. The ownership of the slaves was divided in fractions, for example one share equaled 1/5th of 4/5th of a slave.

          <p>  John Christian died on March 7, 1821, without issue. He died leaving brothers and sisters of the whole and half blood and the children of his deceased brothers and sisters.

John Christian had a sister named Sally Ames who was his only sibling of the whole blood. John had a paternal brother named William Christian. He had two paternal sisters who were named Betsy Milby and Rosey Fisher. He had two maternal sisters who were named Ann Ames and Catherine Johnson.

In the letter, he tells his stepchildren, who lived in Northampton County, about the death of their mother. The letter is very religious in nature.

          <p>   Edmund James sold Thomas James a schooner named "Schooner Susan" or "Schooner Sukey". Thomas James claims the schooner had rotten boards and when he bought it and Edmund James was to pay for its repairs. The deposition of Thomas Dowty talks about how the schooner was blown on shore and he offered to get the boat off the shore. He describes the boat as being a pretty good boat that some timbers were good and some timbers were rotten.  Stephen Kellam said he heard the schooner leaked. Victor Ewing was paid to make repairs on the vessel by Edmund James said unseaworthy and gives a description of the vessel after it was blown ashore by the gale.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>George is suing to prevent Mr. Kellam from selling him for life as a slave in the Southern Market. George's grandmother Sabra (Sabrah) was freed according to the 1800 Will of Walter Hatton when she became age 31 and her heirs were to be freed at age 31 also. George is not yet 31 years old. The decree said that George could not be sold, but he could be hired out in any part of the Commonwealth until he became 31 years old and freed. According to the bill of complaint, Thomas C. Bunting and William J. Goffigon were "engaged in supplying the Southern market in part, with persons of Color in the character of slaves." George was in the custody of the Jailor of Northampton County "awaiting as he is informed and believes transportation to some slave market beyond the limits of the County of Accomac and the Commonwealth of Virginia."

The witnesses were questioned about his conduct when he returned home and Mrs. Winder's conduct when he was away.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>Ibby Jane Smith died in 1880 age 16 or 17. She was a pensioner of the United States as the heir of her father Seth Smith, alias Scott, who served in the Civil War in Company C, 10th Regiment, United States Colored Troops. Seth died at Point of Rocks, May 22, 1865. Since Seth and Ibby's mother Leah lived together while they were slaves, Leah's family claims that Ibby was illegitimate and Seth's family claims that she was legitimate. Leah's family wanted to be the sole heirs of Ibby's estate and Seth's family claimed they are heirs also. There is a lot of information about both sides of Ibby Jane's family. The deposition of Jacob Fitchett tells how Leah brought Ibby Jane to the Freedman's Bureau at Town Fields, to report her birth and that she was the daughter of Seth Smith, alias Scott. The final item in this suit is a Supersedeas Bond that cites the Laws used to determine that Ibby was the legitimate child of Seth Scott and Leah Jacobs.
