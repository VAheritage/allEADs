      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories. 
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Northampton County was named probably for the English county, of which Obedience Robins, a prominent early resident of the Eastern Shore, was a native. The county, which originally included all of the peninsula south of Maryland and which was one of the eight shires, or counties, first enumerated in 1634, was first called Accomack. The General Assembly changed the name to Northampton County in 1643. Accomack County was created from Northampton County about 1663, but in October 1670, the General Assembly temporarily reunited the two counties as Northampton County. In November 1673, Accomack County was again separated from Northampton. The county seat is Eastville.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Northampton County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1721-1912, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.
</p>
<p>Due to Northampton County's location on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, a recurrent theme across several chancery causes is naval warfare's impact upon citizens of Northampton. Examples include men impressed into the British Navy during the Revolutionary War and War of 1812, as well as enslaved men fleeing to the British Navy during the Revolutionary War. </p>

<p> These records also contain a fairly substantial amount of information concerning enslaved Black men, women, and children. While there are several suits concerning the freedom of enslaved individuals, these cases largely represent the perspective of white enslavers and their disputes involving the sale, hiring, financial responsibilities, and legality of ownership of Black individuals. </p>

<p> There are several cases 1831-1832, that relate to members of the Gingaskin Indian Tribe [Accomac Indian Tribe] and specifically document attempts to hold on to their land after white officials and inhabitants terminated their reservation and later took Gingaskin land after the Southampton Rebellion [Nat Turner's Rebellion]</p>

          <p>These suits concerned plots of land in Indian Town, Va., which belonged to the Gingaskin Indian Tribe. The Gingaskin Indian Tribe formerly held reservation land in Northampton County, however the General Assembly passed a law in 1813 to eliminate the reservation and divided the land between official members of the Gingaskin Indian Tribe. While three-fourths of individual Gingaskin owners held onto their land after 1813, most of those people were forced out after Nat Turner's insurrection in 1831 due to the fears of white inhabitants of further uprisings.

          <p>George seeks to prevent Thomas Hatton Kellam from selling him in the Southern Market. Sabra (or Sabrah), George's grandmother, was freed according to the 1800 will of Walter Hatton upon reaching the age of 31. Saraba' heirs were to be freed at age 31 as well. George wass not yet 31 years old at the time of the court case. The decree said that George could not be sold, but he could be hired out in any part of the Commonwealth until he became 31 years old and freed. According to the bill of complaint, Thomas C. Bunting and William J. Goffigon were "engaged in supplying the Southern market in part, with persons of Color in the character of slaves." George was in the custody of the Jailor of Northampton County "awaiting as he is informed and believes transportation to some slave market beyond the limits of the County of Accomac and the Commonwealth of Virginia."

Sallie stated that the Federal Forces were "making an invasion of the County of Accomack" when he left in 1861. Richard left her at home with two young children, a large farm and a population of enslaved people. She also accused her husband of adultery. Richard wanted a divorce because he believed his wife committed adultery, allegedly occuring during the Civil War. Richard was posted at Anderson Prison in Georgia and appears to have been a resident of Libby Prison until March 1865. The witnesses were questioned about his conduct when he returned home and Sallie's conduct when he was away.

The will starts with instructions of how he wants to be buried and instructions of how and where to build the vault for his body.   Smith wanted to be buried in a metallic coffin, in a vault built entirely above ground on the highest point of land he owned. He had other instructions about his burial plot.</p>

          <p>Ibby Jane Smith died in 1880 at the age of either 16 or 17. She was a pensioner of the United States as the heir of her father Seth Smith, alias Scott. Smith served in the Civil War as a member of the "Colored Troops," but died in May of 1865. Since Seth and Leah, Ibby's mother, lived together while they were enslaved, Leah's family claimed that Ibby was illegitimate while Seth's family claimed that she was legitimate. The deposition of Jacob Fitchett tells how Leah brought Ibby Jane to the Freedman's Bureau at Town Fields in order to report her birth, making her his legitimate daughter.

          <p>The suit examines the difficulties of both previously enslaved people and their free children in post-War Virginia, especially in regards to "legitimacy." As only "legitimate" children and spouses could inherit property, this case reveals the legal gray area many people of color inhabited due to the laws surrounding slavery and the family. Laws enacted to preserve control over Black bodies by the white population continued to inhibit people of color even after slavery had long since ended.

          <p>In a deposition included in this divorce suit, Henry Cypress was asked if he remembered when the couple had separated. He stated that "they separated about Irish Potato planting time, February or March, of 1898. I remember only by the time Shelly Banks was frozen to death during the bid February Blizzard." Cypress also stated he "was a member of an investigating committee of my church when Severn Spady was disciplined on account of the separation."

        <scopecontent>
          <p> The Capeville District's former school building was on one-fourth acre of land which was too small for the students, so the School Board bought a two and a half acre lot. The first petition asked to have the title of the land certified and recorded. The second petition was a request to sell the one-fourth acre of land they no longer needed. The land the School Board purchased was to be used for a new High School for white students.
