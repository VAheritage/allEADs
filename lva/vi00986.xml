<p>The Records of the Press Secretary (Kevin Hall, January 2006-October 2007) are housed in five (5) boxes.  Original order was impossible to ascertain.  The records have been put in chronological order by the processing archivist.  These records consist primarily of documents related to the 2006 budget/transportation plan, 2007 budget/transportation plan, and press releases.  Kevin Hall also served as Governor Mark Warner's deputy press secretary and press secretary.  A few records in this series date from that service.  These records include correspondence, talking points, presentations, memorandum, e-mail, reports, schedules, speeches, and notes.
