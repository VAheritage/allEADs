         <head>Biographical Information</head>
         <p>Francis Walker Gilmer was born 9 October 1790 at "Pen Park"
         in Albemarle County, Virginia, to George Gilmer (1742-1795)
         and Lucy Walker Gilmer (1751-1800). He received some of his
         education at Monticello from Martha Jefferson Randolph
         (1772-1836) and at a school run by James Ogilvie (1760-1820).
         Gilmer attended the College of William and Mary in 1809-1810,
         then studied law under William Wirt (1772-1834) in Richmond,
         Virginia. Upon the completion of his legal studies, he
         travelled extensively along the eastern seaboard with the Abbe
         Joseph Francisco Correa de Serra (1750-1823) before beginning
         the practice of law in Winchester, Virginia, in 1816. A year
         later, Gilmer returned to Richmond to continue practicing law.
         In 1824, he was chosen by Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) to
         travel to Europe to hire professors for the newly established
         University of Virginia. Gilmer himself was appointed professor
         of law, but he died before he could assume his position on 25
         February 1826 at "Farmington" in Albemarle County.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>Letters, 1812-1825, of Francis Walker Gilmer (1790-1826) of
         Richmond and Winchester, Virginia, to William Wirt (1772-1834)
         of Richmond and Washington D.C. discussing Gilmer's and Wirt's
         legal careers; their health; family and acquaintances;
         Gilmer's travels; education and literature; Virginia and
         United States politics. Gilmer writes about his reading law
         under Wirt and the education of Wirt's children; Gilmer's law
         practice in Winchester and Richmond and the possibility of
         settling in Baltimore, Maryland; Wirt's legal career,
         including arguing before the Supreme Court, appointment as
         United States attorney for the Richmond District, and his
         service as United States Attorney General; and his and Wirt's
         health. Gilmer writes about authors and literature, including
         Wirt's biography of Patrick Henry (1736-1799). He comments on
         the British burning of Hampton, Virginia, during the War of
         1812. Gilmer discusses the bar in Winchester, Richmond and
         Maryland, commenting on the legal abilities of William Pinkney
         (1764-1822), Littleton Waller Tazewell (1774-1860), John
         Wickham (1763-1839), and Wirt. Gilmer also mentions the
         adverse effects of his journey to Europe to hire professors
         for the University of Virginia upon his health. Gilmer
         discusses mutual friends and acquaintances like William H.
         Cabell (1772-1853), Dabney Carr (1773-1837), Thomas Jefferson
         (1743-1826), John Randolph (1773-1833), the Abbe Correa de
         Serra (1750-1823), and Abel P. Upshur (1790-1844).</p>
