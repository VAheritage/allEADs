<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The West and Adam daybook and ledger consist of a daybook and a ledger.
</p>
<p>Daybook records transactions as they occurred on a daily basis from March 1806 - June 1807. Information found in each entry includes name of customer, items purchased, quantity of items purchased, cost per
item, amount owed, and amount paid. Merchandise sold include clothing, brandy, spices, dry-goods, scissors, knives, pipes, and almanacs. Payments made predominantly by cash and credit. Information in daybook was
transferred to the customer's individual account in corresponding ledger.
</p>
<p>Ledger, 1804-1809, records the accounts of individual customers and West and Adam's controlling accounts. Each account lists transactions in chronological order. Information found in each entry includes date of
transaction, form of transaction, page number of transaction found in corresponding daybooks, amount owed, form of payment, and amount paid. Volume does not contain detailed information regarding items sold by the
merchant. Rather, it uses the general terms "sundries" and "merchandise." For more detailed information regarding items sold see corresponding daybook. The merchant's controlling accounts include merchandise
account, bonds payable, bonds receivable, tobacco, corn, and cash account.
