<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The National Association of Alcoholism Counselors and Trainers (NAACT) held its first organizational meeting in Washington DC, in June, 1974, during a period when the alcoholism field was experiencing rapid growth as a result of a new federal program of grants for treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention of alcohol abuse and alcoholism. Matthew J. Rose, a retired government official and resident of Arlington, VA, led the effort to establish a national organization, and became Executive Director of the new association. Counselors sought recognition of their profession in the expanding field through nationally recognized certification standards and procedures. Advocacy through a national organization was perceived as necessary to advance the profession. Coinciding with efforts to organize a national association of counselors, the Virginia Association of Alcoholism Counselors (VAAC) was being formed. Individuals active at the national level were prominent in the Virginia association, including Virginia residents Edward Riordan and Mel Schulstad. The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Rehabilitation Program (ADERP) at Virginia Commonwealth University, under Marcia Lawton, Ph.D., and the Greater Richmond Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (GRCADA) also contributed to the organizational effort. The National Association of Alcoholism Counsleors and Trainers in June, 1976, changed its name to National Association of Alcoholism Counselors (NAAC), in a move to provide a sole focus on counselors.
</p>
<p>In August 1982, the board of directors changed the name to the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors (NAADAC), then adopted new by-laws providing for individual membership in addition to affiliation by state associations. Membership grew to 14,000 with affiliates in all 50 states. The Association played an integral role in the effort to establish a nationally recognized set of standards and procedures for the credentialing of counselors, culminating in 1990 when the NAADAC Certification Commission was established to administer the credential of National Certified Addiction Counselor. Some 8,000 counselors qualified initially for the certification.
