      <head>Historical Information</head>
      <p>On 7 January 1919, Governor Westmoreland Davis created the
         Virginia War History Commission whose goal was "to complete an
         accurate and complete history of Virginia's military, economic
         and political participation in the World War." The Commission
         consisted of sixteen leading citizens appointed by the
         governor including: Reverend Collins Denny, Brigadier General
         Jo Lane Stern, Adjutant General of Virginia, Douglas Southall
         Freeman, editor of the Richmond News-Leader, State Librarian
         Henry R. McIlwaine, and Colonel Charles R. Keiley, Executive
         Secretary of the Second Virginia Council of Defense. Arthur
         Kyle Davis, president of Southern Female College in
         Petersburg, was named chairman of the commission. The
         commission served without compensation and from January to
         September 1919 relied on the Second Virginia Council of
         Defense for financial support. Subsequently, on the governor's
         recommendation, the General Assembly appropriated $10,000 on
         10 September 1919 to enable the commission to discharge its
         duties. Financial support was continued from 1919 to 1927 by
         annual appropriations.</p>
      <p>Upon his appointment as chairman, Arthur Kyle Davis
         immediately implemented his plan for preserving Virginia's war
         records. On 6 August 1918, during the presentation of a
         service flag by the United Daughters of the Confederacy at the
         Sussex County Court House, Davis proposed that the people of
         each community in Virginia preserve the records and activities
         of their activities. Local branches of the Commission,
         consisting of a chairman and two associates, were established
         in Virginia's 100 counties and 21 cities, to collect records
         of their community's military and civilian activities. The
         Commission created a fifteen topic outline of subjects to be
         included in the statewide history. Some of the topics included
         Virginians of Distinguished Service, Virginia Churches,
         Economic Conditions, Red Cross and War Letters and Diaries. An
         editor assigned to each topic would then write the narrative.
         This material would then form the basis of the Commission's
         proposed four volume history of Virginia during the World
         War.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, poor or non-existent leadership by the local
         branches, apathy, and a lack of time and money hampered the
         Commission's collection of war records. The quantity and
         quality of records collected varied widely. In 1921 the
         Commission published four War History Supplements in the
         Virginia Magazine of History and Biography listing the source
         material collected by the local branches. Very few records
         were collected after 1921 and interest in the Commission's
         work quickly waned.</p>
      <p>In addition to the magazine supplements, the Virginia War
         History Commission published seven volumes. Volumes I-IV were
         summaries of source material compiled by the commission. These
         volumes included lists of distinguished soldiers, newspaper
         clippings chronicling the war, a guide to war letters, diaries
         and editorials, and a series of sketches of civilian war
         agencies. Volumes V-VII were specific chronicles of Virginia
         wartime activities. Volumes include military unit histories
         and locality histories that describe the location of the
         communities, their resources, pre-war conditions, economic
         conditions, relief and institutional war work. Preliminary
         manuscripts for a narrative history of Virginia's role in the
         war were prepared as well. By June 1928 all of the source
         materials and manuscripts were transferred to the Virginia
         State Library, but, because of various difficulties, the
         narrative history was never published. The War History
         Commission submitted their last annual report to the Governor
         and General Assembly on 18 January 1928 and had ceased all
         operations by July 1928.</p>

These records document Virginia's participation in World War I and its attempt to preserve records of that participation.</p>
      <p>Following is a brief overview of the collection. A more in-depth description of the collection can be found in the Series and Subseries level descriptions. It is recommended that the researcher read the Series level scope and content notes thoroughly before accessing the collection.</p>
      <p>The experiences of Virginians in the military during the war are well documented throughout the collection.  Information on the background and experiences of individual soldiers (and a few nurses) is recorded in the questionnaires (Series I and Series II).  Additional information concerning soldiers' views of the war may be found in letters and diaries (Series VI, Series VII, Series IX and Series X).</p>
      <p>Of note to the military historian, the collection includes histories of Virginia units including Home Guards and the history of Virginia military cantonments including Camp Humphreys and Camp Lee (Series III, Series IV and Series VIII).</p>
      <p>For researchers interested in home front activities, there are some noteworthy records.  Propaganda, food and fuel conservation, health and morality issues are highlighted in the records of the First Virginia Council of Defense (Series XII), Virginia Agricultural Council of Safety (Series XIII) and Second Virginia Council of Defense (Series XIV).  Additional records of note include material on churches and schools (Series V, Series VI and Series VII).</p>
      <p>The collection contains extensive information on the activities of the Virginia War History Commission including personnel, local branches and publications. (Series XI).</p>
      <p>Volumes were housed in boxes for better protection.  Oversized items are filed in 5 boxes.  Oversize items, which were part of a regular sized filing unit, were removed from their respective folders. In their place, separation notices list the item(s) removed and the oversize box and folder number to which they have been removed. For location and content list of oversize folders see list at the end of the finding aid.</p>

          <p>The Individual Service Records (Questionnaires) series is housed in 20 boxes and is arranged into two (2) subseries.  Subseries have been designated for Counties and Cities.  Each subseries is arranged alphabetically by locality and there under alphabetically by name of soldier (with white and non-white questionnaires further segregated).  This series consists of questionnaires completed by soldiers who served from Virginia during World War I or their next-of-kin.  The four page questionnaire records personal and military data.  The first page records personal information including the full name of the soldier, date and place of birth, name of mother and father (and their places of birth), race, religious affiliation, names of wife and children, fraternal orders and college fraternities, education, occupation prior to entering the service, name of employer, residence before and after time in service, and present home address.  The second and third pages records military information including, date of induction, rank, military branch and ID number, military company, regiment and division; where trained or stationed, port of embarkation and debarkation, experiences in action, citations for and details of distinguished services, details of any injuries (or death), and occupation after the war.  The fourth page contains several questions designed to elicit information about how the war affected the serviceman and how he perceived his experiences during the war.  The questions deal with the effect of disabilities upon occupation and employment, the serviceman's attitude toward military service, the mental and physical effects of United States camp experiences and of overseas experiences, how the experience affected his religious beliefs, and the effects of all of these experiences as contrasted with his state of mind before the war.  Nurses submitted a two page questionnaire asking similar questions.  Photographs often accompany the questionnaires.</p>

          <p>The Virginians of Distinguished Service series is housed in 14 boxes and arranged into five (5) subseries.  Subseries have been designated for Reference Files, Correspondence, Reference Cards, Rough Drafts and Miscellaneous Materials.   This series documents the Commission's efforts to gather information for its first source volume, Virginians of Distinguished Service of the World War (Richmond:  1923), edited by Arthur Kyle Davis.  This series includes Individual Service Records (Questionnaires) that are not included in Series I.</p>
          <p>The Reference Files subseries is housed in 4 boxes and is arranged alphabetically by name of soldier.  This subseries has been microfilmed.  See Miscellaneous Reels 4694-4701.  In preparation for its first source volume, Virginians of Distinguished Service of the World War, the Commission reviewed its own files and removed all questionnaires for soldiers receiving citations, decorations or other honors. The Commission then created an alphabetical reference file consisting largely of questionnaires but also including photographs, letters from the soldier, family member or next-of-kin, newspaper clippings and certified copies of citations. Questionnaires do not exist for every soldier in the file and in a few cases the only record is a copy of soldier's citation. In addition to soldiers who received honors, the reference file includes records for soldiers who did not receive an official citation or whose citations could not be verified. Noteworthy files include Thomas Bolling Byrd, brother of Virginia Governor and Senator Harry F. Byrd, Arthur H. Kelly, who died in Poland fighting the Bolsheviks and Richard Fuller Woodward, whose widow submitted letters about her visit to her husband's grave in France.</p>
          <p>The Correspondence subseries is housed in 3 boxes and is arranged into three distinct groupings of correspondence. The first, spanning May 1922 to February 1923, documents attempts by the Commission to get copies of citations from soldiers. Correspondence is both incoming and outgoing and is arranged alphabetically by recipient. There is extensive correspondence from Colonel Joseph R. Anderson, author of  Record of Service In the World War of V.M.I. Alumni, describing his assistance in acquiring citations from V.M.I. soldiers and from John S. Patton, Librarian at the University of Virginia, documenting his efforts to acquire citations from UVA students. Additional correspondence from Newton D. Mereness and Lewis H. Machen chronicles their efforts to obtain list of Virginians of Distinguished Service for the Commission in Washington, D.C. The second group of correspondence, covering 1923-1925, relates to the publication and promotion of Virginians of Distinguished Service. Subjects covered include: errors and omissions, ordering/selling, book reviews, requests for additional information and complimentary copies. The third group is unclaimed form letters sent to soldiers in 1922 requesting copies of their citations.</p>
          <p>The Reference Cards subseries is housed in 2 boxes and is arranged alphabetically.  Each index card contains the text of each soldier's citation as well as the source of information.</p>
          <p>The Rough Drafts subseries is housed in 3 boxes and is arranged alphabetically by name of soldier. The information on the Reference Cards (subseries C) was used to write the rough drafts of each soldier's entry in the book. </p>
          <p>The Miscellaneous Materials subseries is housed in 2 boxes and contains miscellaneous lists and unidentified miscellaneous materials.</p>

          <p>The Virginia Military Organizations series is housed in 8 boxes with oversized material separated and is arranged into five (5) subseries.  Subseries have been designated for 29th Division, 42nd Division, 80th Division, Miscellaneous Units and Miscellaneous and Correspondence.  This series consists primarily of unit histories written by unit members.  Many of these records are described in Virginia War History Commission, Supplement No. 3, Calendar of Military Histories, Narratives and Reports (July 1921 issue of Virginia Magazine of History and Biography) and Supplement No. 4, Lists and Calendars of Source Material (October 1921 issue of Virginia Magazine of History and Biography.  In addition many of these unit histories were published by Arthur Kyle Davis, editor, in Virginia Military Organizations in the World War (Source Volume 5) (Richmond:  1925).</p>
          <p>The 29th Division subseries is housed in 3 boxes and one oversized folder.  Records of the 29th Division include a "History of the 'Blue and Gray,' 29th Division" by Lt. Col. John A Cutchins, a description of operations of the 29th Division, East of the Meuse River, in October 1918, histories of the 116th Infantry (by company) and histories of the 111th Field Artillery (by company).</p>
          <p>The 42nd Division subseries is housed in 1 box.  The records of the 42nd Division include a brief history of the unit and a copy of the Journal of Private G.W. Reed, 117th Train Headquarters and Military Police, describing his activities between 1917 April 8 and 1919 April 5.</p>
          <p>The 80th Division subseries is housed in 3 boxes.  The records of the 80th Division includes histories of the 317th, 318th and 320th Infantry regiments, 314th Machine Gun Battalion, 315th Field Artillery, 305th Engineers and a copy of Captain Josiah C. Peck's book, History of the 319th Infantry.  Notable documents include "My Service with the A.E.F. in France," by Captain Melville Oakham, 320th Infantry and copies of  The Service Magazine, published by the Eightieth Division Veterans Association, from 1921-1927.</p>
          <p>The Miscellaneous Units subseries is housed in 1 box.  Miscellaneous Units include histories of the Virginia Coast Artillery, Medical Units (Base Hospital 41 and 45 and Sanitation Units 516, 517 and 534), and Engineer Units (28th Engineering Division and 510th and 511th Engineers' Service Battalions).  The most significant item in this sub-series is the collection of photographs of the nursing staff of Base Hospital 45.  Photographs of 104 of the 106 staff members are included.</p>
          <p>The Miscellaneous and Correspondence subseries is housed in 1 box and one oversized folder.  Noteworthy is the statement of Private John Leedy of the 116th Infantry in which Leedy describes a gas attack in the Meuse-Argonne Valley in October 1918.  Also included are statements of service by Major John Izaard, 60th Artillery, Alexander W. Weddell, War Trade Board Delegate to Greece and A.B. Cooke of the American Consulate, Pantros, Greece.  There are two groupings of correspondence. The first, spanning 1919 to 1922, documents attempts by Commission member Adjutant General Jo Lane Stern to obtain unit histories from soldiers. Correspondence is both incoming and outgoing and is arranged alphabetically by recipient.  There is extensive correspondence from Captain Greenlee D. Letcher, 111th Field Artillery, 29th Division, describing his difficulty in obtaining records for his history of the 111th and Major Hierome L. Opie, commenting on his inability to find time to write a history of the 116th Infantry.  The second group of correspondence, covering 1925, contains follow-up requests for unit information by Stern in preparation for Source Volume 5, Virginia Military Organizations in the World War.</p>

          <p>The Virginia Schools and Colleges series is housed in 2 boxes and is arranged alphabetically by the name of the school.  This series contains reports of war activities during the World War including home-front contributions made by students (Red Cross work, etc.) and lists of students/graduates who served in the armed forces or were killed.  Most of the material consists of brief responses to requests for information on war activities made by Dr. James S. Wilson, a University of Virginia professor and chairman of Commission's Virginia Schools and Colleges section, between 1919 and 1922.  Schools that responded were:  Augusta Military Academy, Blackstone College for Girls, Blackstone Military Academy, Bridgewater College, Chatham Training School, Christiansburg Industrial Institute, College of William and Mary, Eastern College, Elizabeth College, Emory and Henry College, Episcopal High School of Virginia near Alexandria, Fredericksburg Normal School (now Mary Washington College), Hartshorn Memorial College, Halifax Institute, Hampden-Sidney College, Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, Harrisonburg State Normal School, Hollins College, Industrial High School (Danville, Va.), Ingleside Seminary, Marion College for Women, Miller Manual Labor School, Newport Training School, Inc., Randolph-Macon Academy, Randolph-Macon College, Rappahannock Industrial Academy, City of Richmond Schools and Colleges, Roanoke College, St. Emma Industrial and Agricultural College, Shenandoah Valley Academy, Southern College, Staunton Military Academy, Stonewall Jackson College, Stuart Hall, Sullins College, Sweet Briar College, University of Richmond, University of Virginia, Virginia College, Virginia Military Institute, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Virginia Union University, Washington and Lee University and Woodberry Forest School.</p>
          <p>Notable records include:   a list of graduates and current students who served in the armed forces during the war and a list of those killed-in-action from the College of William and Mary; a 1920 Episcopal High School of Virginia yearbook, Whispers, that includes a list of "Alumni in Service in the World War"; an extensive history of the University of Richmond's activities during the World War; a copy of John S. Patton's 1921 book, The University of Virginia in the World War; and a copy of Joseph Reid Anderson's 1920 book, V.M.I. in the World War.</p>
          <p>Additional records on Virginia's Schools and Colleges may be found in the series' County Source Material and City Source Material.</p>

          <p>The series County Source Material contains records collected by the Local Branches of the Virginia War History Commission.  To assist Local Branches with their task, the Commission provided them with a detailed ten topic outline describing the types of records to be collected:  Topic 1, Virginians of Distinguished Service (military and civilian); Topic 2, Pre-War Conditions and Activities (education, religion, patriotism, and economic and social conditions; Topic 3, Virginia Churches in War Time (lists of members in service, religious attitudes and church activities); Topic 4, Virginia Schools and Colleges in the War; Topic 5 (Draft Law and Virginia Organizations (draft laws); Topic 6, Economic and Social Conditions (finance, agriculture, industry, commerce, transportation, communication and labor and social conditions); Topic 7, The Red Cross in Virginia; Topic 8, War Work and Relief Organizations (activities of welfare organizations such as Y.M.C.A, Y.W.C.A., Knights of Columbus, Jewish Welfare,  and Salvation Army); Topic 9, War Letters, Diaries and Incidents; and Topic 10, Post War Conditions and Activities.  The complete outline is available in Virginia War History Commission, Publication No. 3, Virginia in the War:  Topical Outline for a City or County War History (August 1920).</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the county branches only submitted information for a tiny fraction of the topics listed on the outline.  Many only submitted one or two items.  However, other localities submitted a substantial number of records.  In addition, some records collected by the County branches were removed and filed separately such as the Individual Service Records (Questionnaires), records of Virginians of Distinguished Service (military) and college histories.  The majority of records collected by the county branches are described and calendared in the following publications:  Virginia War History Commission, Supplement No. 1, Source Material from Virginia Counties (January 1921 issue of Virginia Magazine of History and Biography) and Supplement No. 4, Lists and Calendars of Source Material (October 1921 issue of Virginia Magazine of History and Biography.  Letters written by Virginia soldiers and sailors are described and indexed in source volume 3, Virginia War Letters, Diaries, and Editorials, edited by Arthur Kyle Davis (Richmond:  War History Commission, 1925).  Within this volume, letters are arranged alphabetically by author and include date of letters, brief description of content and list the writer's county of residence.  Additional letters omitted from this volume are included in this series.  In this series, letters are filed by locality and alphabetical therein.</p>
          <p>The County Source Material series is housed in 13 boxes, one oversize box and one oversize map folder and is arranged alphabetically by locality and by topic there under.  Notable records include two <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">Bath County</title> broadsides.  The first broadside, dated 14 July 1918, announces an address by N.A. Marshall, a Canadian solider.  The second broadside, dated May 1918, celebrates the Third Liberty Loan drive.  William White of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">Dickenson County</title> submitted the life story of his son, Leonard Joseph White, who was killed in action on 1 October 1918.  Also included are letters written by <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">Henry County</title> brothers George Edmond Pannill (1896-1918) and Jeb Stuart Pannill (1897-1918).  Both enlisted in the army on 6 June 1917 and were assigned to Co. K, 9th Infantry, 2nd Division.  On the morning of 18 July 1918 bother brothers were fatally wounded.  George was shot through the head and died within two minutes; Jeb was shot in the chest and died on 4 August 1918 (see also the Individual Service Records (Questionnaires) for George and Jeb Pannill).  A biographical sketch of Earle Davis Gregory (1897-1972), Virginia's only World War I Medal of Honor recipient is located among the records of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">Mecklenburg County</title>.  Included among the records of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">Prince Edward County</title> is a copy of Walker H. Jordan's 1919 book With "Old Eph" in the Army.  Jordan, an African-American, describes his military experiences as a member of the 351st Field Artillery in the United States and France.  A photograph of the 305th Engineers is filed under <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">Loudoun County</title>.  Finally, there are drafts of county histories published in source volumes 6 and 7, Virginia Communities in War Time, edited by Arthur Kyle Davis (Richmond:  War History Commission, 1926-1927).</p>

          <p>The series City Source Material contains records collected by the Local Branches of the Virginia War History Commission.  To assist Local Branches with their task, the Commission provided them with a detailed ten topic outline describing the types of records to be collected:  Topic 1, Virginians of Distinguished Service (military and civilian); Topic 2, Pre-War Conditions and Activities (education, religion, patriotism, and economic and social conditions; Topic 3, Virginia Churches in War Time (lists of members in service, religious attitudes and church activities); Topic 4, Virginia Schools and Colleges in the War; Topic 5 (Draft Law and Virginia Organizations (draft laws); Topic 6, Economic and Social Conditions (finance, agriculture, industry, commerce, transportation, communication and labor and social conditions); Topic 7, The Red Cross in Virginia; Topic 8, War Work and Relief Organizations (activities of welfare organizations such as Y.M.C.A, Y.W.C.A., Knights of Columbus, Jewish Welfare,  and Salvation Army); Topic 9, War Letters, Diaries and Incidents; and Topic 10, Post War Conditions and Activities.  The complete outline is available in Virginia War History Commission, Publication No. 3, Virginia in the War:  Topical Outline for a City or County War History (August 1920).</p>
          <p>Unlike the county source material, the city branches, especially Newport News, Norfolk, and Richmond, submitted a substantial number of records for a large number of the topics listed on the outline.  In addition, some records collected by the City branches were removed and filed separately such as the Individual Service Records (Questionnaires), records of Virginians of Distinguished Service (military) and college histories.  The majority of records collected by the city branches are described and calendared in the following publications:  Virginia War History Commission, Supplement No. 2, Source Material from Virginia Cities (April 1921 issue of Virginia Magazine of History and Biography), Supplement No. 3, Calendar of Military Histories, Narratives and Reports (July 1921 issue of Virginia Magazine of History and Biography) and Supplement No. 4, Lists and Calendars of Source Material (October 1921 issue of Virginia Magazine of History and Biography.  Letters written by Virginia soldiers and sailors are described and indexed in source volume 3, Virginia War Letters, Diaries, and Editorials, edited by Arthur Kyle Davis (Richmond:  War History Commission, 1925).  Within this volume, letters are arranged alphabetically by author and include date of letters, brief description of content and list the writer's city of residence.  Additional letters omitted from this volume are included in this series.  In this series, letters are filed by locality and alphabetical therein.</p>
          <p>The City Source Material series is housed in 28 boxes and three oversized map folders and is arranged alphabetically by locality and by topic there under.  Notable records include:

          <p>Following the draft into federal service and mobilization of the Virginia National Guard for Mexican Border Service and later war against Germany in 1917, a need arose to create a new militia force in Virginia. By order of Governor Henry C. Stuart, Adjutant General W.W. Sale issued a form letter authorizing the immediate formation of Home Defense organizations to be known as "Virginia State Volunteers" to serve during "the emergency." Two classes of Home Defense Organizations were created consisting of the Virginia State Volunteers and Virginia Home Guard. Lt. Col. Jo Lane Stern, State Inspector, was assigned the duty of organizing these volunteers. Companies of Virginia Volunteers were raised throughout the state including two battalions of infantry and over twenty individual companies. After the signing of the Armistice, most of these units disbanded or mustered out by 1920, although three companies passed over into the National Guard.

          <p>The Virginia War Diaries and Incidents series is housed in 4 boxes and consists of records from 45 Virginia soldiers and civilians.  Most of the narratives are only a few pages but some are of significant length.  Notable records include a book by Palmer V. Boyd, <emph render="bold">Kriegegfangenlanger 80053:  My Experiences as a Prisoner of War in Germany</emph> and extensive material submitted by Charles Hall Davis.  <emph render="bold">Virginia War Letters, Diaries and Editorials</emph>, edited by Arthur Kyle Davis, includes a detailed calendar of most of these records (see pages 475-486, 525 and 527).  Several diaries and narratives included in this series were omitted from the source volume.

          <p>The Council of National Defense was created by an act of Congress on 29 August 1916 to coordinate all national resources pertaining to the efficient mobilization and maintenance of the United States armed forces.  After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, the federal government requested that each state create a State Council of Defense to carry out the duties of the National Council.  To comply with this request, Virginia Governor Henry Carter Stuart created an unwieldy organization which included the Agricultural Council of Safety (18 April 1917), Industrial Council of Safety (25 April 1917), and the Virginia Council of Defense (26 April 1917).  The duties of each council overlapped but each retained its own identity.  The Virginia Council of Defense was essentially an advisory body which coordinated the work of all councils.  Governor Westmoreland Davis corrected this situation when he abolished all three councils in February 1918 and organized all defense activities under the Second Virginia Council of Defense.  Members of the First Virginia Council of Defense included:  General Edward W. Nichols, Superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute; L.E. Johnson, President of the Norfolk and Western Railway Company; R. Walton Moore, United States Representative; Homer L. Ferguson, President of the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company; Colonel Elijah B. White; Rev. Collins Denny; Dr. Ennion G. Williams, State Health Commissioner; James O. Winston; Richard Evelyn Byrd; D. Lawrence Groner; George B. Keezell; John H. Crockett; Jesse M. Jones; and A.P. Walker.
</p>
          <p>The Virginia War History Commission published a history of the First Virginia Council of Defense and an index to their records in Virginia War Agencies, Selective Services and Volunteers (Source Volume 4) (Richmond:  1926, pp. 3-34 &amp; 395-418), edited by Arthur Kyle Davis.
</p>
          <p>The First Virginia Council of Defense series is housed in 6 boxes and one oversized folder and is arranged in two(2) subseries.  Subseries have been designated for Source Material and Records.  The series consists primarily of incoming and outgoing correspondence to the Council particularly Executive Secretary Colonel William M. Hunley, Speakers' Bureau head Lewis H. Machen and Virginia Governor Henry Stuart, and copies of publications, pamphlets and newsletters from the Council of National Defense and from other state councils.  It is unknown why some of the records the Virginia Council were filed with Source Materials (Subseries A) and other similar records with Records (Subseries B).  Researchers should check both subseries.  These records document the activities of the First Virginia Council of Defense in Virginia including such areas as agriculture, food conservation, military matters, publicity, religious forces, Speakers' Bureau, and the Woman's Division.
</p>
          <p>The Source Material subseries is housed in 5 boxes and is indexed in Virginia War Agencies, Selective Services and Volunteers (Source Volume 4) (Richmond:  1926, pp. 395-418), edited by Arthur Kyle Davis.  The records in this subseries are arranged by topic and sub-heading.  Topics include agriculture, farmers, food conservation, fuel conservation, health and morals, industry and labor, Liberty Loans, local councils, military matters, miscellaneous activities of Council, other states, publicity, religious forces, Speakers' Bureau, transportation, Woman's Division and closing period of Council.  When this series was originally processed in 2003, not all of the indexed records were extant.  Most of the missing records were located in 2005 and have been added to the collection.  Unfortunately, very few records are extant for the Woman's Division.
</p>
          <p>Records filed under <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">Agriculture</title> include correspondence related to the Boys' Working Reserve and Boy Scouts as aids to farmers, exemption for farm laborers from military service, loans to farmers and offers of land to the government.
</p>
          <p>The <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">Food Conservation</title> files list bakers who promise to co-operate with Council in the campaign against acceptance of unsold bread and exemptions from military service sought by ice manufacturers.  Harry F. Byrd's appointment as Virginia Fuel Administrator is highlighted in correspondence under <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">Fuel Conservation</title>.  <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">Military Matters</title> described the formation of Home Guards, recruiting and training camp activities.
</p>
          <p>The <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">Speakers' Bureau</title> correspondence contain replies to letters and telegrams of Lewis H. Machen, dated 25 May 1917 requesting cooperation in the June 1917 speaking campaign and the speaking campaign in the fall of 1917.  Additional records include materials submitted by Council's of Defense of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">other states</title>.
</p>
          <p>The Records subseries is housed in 1 box and one oversized folder.  This material is not indexed.  Records of note include the minutes of the Council of Defense for 1917 and 1918.  An oversized scrapbook contains newspaper clippings (Richmond Times-Dispatch and Richmond News-Leader) of the Council's activities from May 1917 to January 1918.

          <p>The Council of National Defense was created by an act of Congress on 29 August 1916 to coordinate all national resources pertaining to the efficient mobilization and maintenance of the United States armed forces.  After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, the federal government requested that each state create a State Council of Defense to carry out the duties of the National Council.  To comply with this request, Virginia Governor Henry Carter Stuart created an unwieldy organization which included the Agricultural Council of Safety (18 April 1917), Industrial Council of Safety (25 April 1917), and the Virginia Council of Defense (26 April 1917).  The duties of each council overlapped but each retained its own identity.  The Virginia Council of Defense was essentially an advisory body which coordinated the work of all councils.  Governor Westmoreland Davis corrected this situation when he abolished all three councils in February 1918 and organized all defense activities under the Second Virginia Council of Defense.  The Agricultural Council of Safety focused on food production and conservation.  Members of the Executive Council were:  Chairman Dr. Jesse M. Jones of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and Secretary B.C. Moomaw, Jr.  Other members of the Council included T.O. Sandy, V. Vaden, Ella G. Agnew, Mrs. B.B. Munford, Dr. H.B. Frissell, B.M. Shepherd, Dr. R.C. Stearns, Dr. J.D. Eggleston, A.B. Thornhill and B.F. Purcell.  Council Secretary B.C. Moomaw established a central office in Richmond and the Council appointed local councils for each county to carry out its' work.

          <p>The Virginia Agricultural Council of Safety series is housed in 5 boxes.  The Virginia War History Commission published a history of the Virginia Agricultural Council of Safety and an index to their records in Virginia War Agencies, Selective Services and Volunteers (Source Volume 4) (Richmond:  1926, pp. 27-32 &amp; 457-480), edited by Arthur Kyle Davis.  The folder numbering for this series corresponds to the numbering used in the index; records not indexed follow.  Not all indexed records are extant.  The majority of the material consists primarily of correspondence between Council Chairman Jesse M. Jones and Secretary B.C. Moomaw and the local councils outlining their organization (including a list of members), plans, and activities.  Other subjects include assistance offered by the Boy Scouts, Farm Labor Exemptions, Food Production and Conservation, Negro Agricultural Councils, Women's Work and correspondence to Jesse M. Jones.  Miscellaneous records include lists of local council members and drafts of the index to the Council's records.

          <p>The Council of National Defense was created by an act of Congress on 29 August 1916 to coordinate all national resources pertaining to the efficient mobilization and maintenance of the United States armed forces.  After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, the federal government requested that each state create a State Council of Defense to carry out the duties of the National Council.  To comply with this request, Virginia Governor Henry Carter Stuart created an unwieldy organization which included the Agricultural Council of Safety (18 April 1917), Industrial Council of Safety (25 April 1917), and the Virginia Council of Defense (26 April 1917).  The duties of each council overlapped but each retained its own identity.  The Virginia Council of Defense was essentially an advisory body which coordinated the work of all councils.  Governor Westmoreland Davis corrected this situation when he abolished all three councils in February 1918 and organized all defense activities under the Second Virginia Council of Defense.
</p>
          <p>The purpose of the Second Virginia Council of Defense remained the same:  "to co-ordinate and to unify the work of all government departments and civic, relief and philanthropic organizations to the end of an efficient and successful execution of war demands in the State of Virginia."  The Second Council created local councils to carry out policy.  The Council was involved in a variety of economic and national defense activities including:  highways and transportation, housing, industries, food conservation, agriculture, livestock, labor, health, National Council of Defense, and publicity campaigns.  Unlike the first council, the Second Virginia Council of Defense had statutory backing, its' members consisted primarily of state government officials who were already engaged in carrying out war-time activities, and it hired a full-time Executive Secretary to execute Council policy.  A complete history of the Second Virginia Council of Defense can be found in Virginia War Agencies, Selective Services and Volunteers (Source Volume 4) (Richmond:  1926, pp. 35-176), edited by Arthur Kyle Davis.
</p>
          <p>Members of the Second Virginia Council of Defense included:  Jo Lane Stern, Adjutant General of Virginia and Chairman; Lewis H. Machen, Director of Legislative Reference Bureau and temporary Executive Secretary; Charles Russell Keiley, permanent Executive Secretary; Rosewell Page, Second Auditor of Virginia; Dr. Ennion G. Williams, State Health Commissioner; George P. Coleman, State Highway Commissioner; Harris Hart, Superintendent of Public Instruction; Dr. H.R. McIlwaine, State Librarian; Joseph Bottom, Commissioner of Insurance; Jesse M. Jones, Virginia Polytechnic Institute; Ella M. Agnew, Home Demonstration Agent; George W. Koiner, Commissioner of Agriculture and Immigration; Christopher B. Garnett, Chairman of State Corporation Commission; Dr. J.T. Mastin, State Board of Charities and Corrections; Charles G. Kizer, Commissioner of Labor Statistics; C.H. Morrisette, Director of Legislative Reference Bureau; J.R. Saunders, Virginia Attorney General; A.B. Thornhill, Acting Dairy and Food Commissioner; Colonel F.N. Billisoly, Commissioner of Fisheries; J.G. Ferneyhough, State Veterinarian; J.T. Brown, Chairman of Livestock Sanitary Board; John Hirschberg, Commissioner of Labor Statistics; Thomas H. Nottingham, State Shellfish Commissioner; R.C. Jones, State Forester; S.L. Lupton, State Corporation Commission; and C. Lee Moore, Auditor of Public Accounts.  On 5 November 1918, Charles R. Keiley was chosen as the Federal Field Secretary of the Council of National Defense to coordinate its activities with those of the Second Virginia Council of Defense.
</p>
          <p>After the armistice ended the war on 11 November 1918, the Second Virginia Council of Defense gradually ended their work.  The Council met for the last time on 8 August 1919.  Charles R. Keiley, Executive Secretary, continued in his position until July 1920 gathering historical records of Virginia during the war and assisting the Virginia War History Commission.
</p>
          <p>The Second Virginia Council of Defense series is housed in 39 boxes with oversized material separated and is arranged into four (4) subseries.  Subseries have been designated for Source Material, Records, Financial Records and Correspondence of Charles R. Keiley.  The series consists primarily of incoming and outgoing correspondence from Executive Secretary Charles R. Keiley and copies of publications, pamphlets and newsletters from the Council of National Defense and from other state councils.  It is unknown why some of the records the Virginia Council, especially from other states, were filed with Source Materials (Subseries A) and other similar records with Records (Subseries B).  Researchers should check both subseries.  This series comprises a large and important section of the Virginia War History Commission records.  These records document the activities of the Second Virginia Council of Defense, Council of National Defense and Local Councils in Virginia including such areas as agriculture, food conservation, health (including the influenza epidemic of 1918), labor and propaganda.
</p>
          <p>The Source Material subseries is housed in 27 boxes, two oversize folders and is indexed in Virginia War Agencies, Selective Services and Volunteers (Source Volume 4) (Richmond:  1926, pp. 421-453), edited by Arthur Kyle Davis.  The records in this subseries are arranged by the number and/or letter assigned to each record listed in the index.  Topics include agriculture, building, community sings, conservation, Council of National Defense, education, fire prevention, health, highways, history, home guard, housing, industry, labor, liberty loan and war savings, livestock, local councils, Negro activities, patriotism and propaganda, pool rooms, reconstruction and post war activities, religious forces, soldiers, Speakers Bureau, sugar, swamp lands, transportation, war photographs, war work, woman's committee and wood.  When this series was originally processed in 2003, not all of the indexed records were extant.  The missing records were located in 2005 and have been added to the collection.  This is the largest of the four subseries and documents the work of the Second Virginia Council of Defense.

Mrs. Kern did volunteer work for a variety of groups during World War I and was president of five World War I organizations:  Richmond War Camp Community Service; Godmothers' League (founded by Kern on 17 September 1917); Women's Auxiliary; Women's Committee, Armistice Celebration; and the Service Legion (founded by Kern on 13 July 1921).  Kern was also state chairman for the America First Committee.  She married Dr. George Thomas Walker Kern (1873-1948), and they had one daughter, Margaret.  Mrs. Kern died 10 July 1975 in Richmond, Virginia, and was buried in Hollywood Cemetery.
</p>
          <p> The Margaret Ethel Kelley Kern Paper series is housed in 2 boxes and is arranged alphabetically by topic.  Noteworthy records include:  a membership list for the America First Committee and an account book for the Godmother's League (additional records on the Godmother's League can be found with the City of Richmond records within the City Source Material series).  Significant materials include extensive material on the Service Legion.  Founded on 13 July 1921 by Kern, the Service Legion, modeled on the American Legion, was created to commemorate civilian service during the war.  Records include the constitution, by-laws and certificate of incorporation of the Service Legion; correspondence to and from Kern dated 1921-1924 &amp; 1928 related to the Service Legion (additional correspondence can be found in the Office Files series); minutes of the Board of Directors of the Service Legion meeting on 5 April 1922; membership applications (including Kern, her husband and daughter) arranged alphabetically that list organizations and statement of state service during the war; and newspaper clippings describing Service Legion activities.  Also included are the minutes of the Woman's Committee, Homecoming Jubilee Week, 22 April-1 July 1919, part of the group planning a homecoming celebration for returning troops in Richmond on 3 July-6 July 1919.  The minute book also includes undated newspaper clippings on the committee's activities.

          <p>Henry Read McIlwaine was born 12 July 1864 in Prince Edward County, Virginia.  He graduated with an A.B. from Hampden-Sidney College in 1885 and with a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1893.  McIlwaine taught in private schools for a few years before returning to Hampden-Sidney College to serve as professor of English and history.  In 1907, he was appointed State Librarian for the Virginia State Library, which position he held until his death.  In January 1919, Governor Westmoreland Davis appointed McIlwaine to the Virginia War History Commission where he held several positions including secretary of the Executive Committee, treasurer, and chairman of the War Letters, Diaries and Incidents section.  Unmarried, he died 16 March 1934 in Richmond, Virginia, and was buried in Blandford Cemetery in Petersburg.
</p>
          <p>The H.R. McIlwaine Papers series is housed in 1 box and consists primarily of incoming and outgoing correspondence to McIlwaine in his role as member of the Virginia War History Commission.  Arranged by date, the majority of correspondence are from 1928-1929 and 1931 and concern purchasing copies of the Commission's publications.  Correspondence are mainly from Arthur Kyle Davis, Russell B. Devine and William B. McIlwaine, Henry's cousin.
