<head>Processing Information
</head>

</p>
<p>The records in this collection were processed as diffent times around 2004 by Greg Crawford.  Efforts have been taken to identify chancery causes related to these business records as some of these records were used as evidence in court proceedings. </p>

<head>Historical Information 
</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph>
Business records, both volumes and loose records, are in some cases transferred to the Library of Virginia as components of court record transfers.  These business records in some cases were simply stored in the local court building for safekeeping by business owners.  In other cases, business records (particularly ledgers, account books, etc.) may have been filed in a court case as an exhibit.  These business record exhibits appeared both in chancery causes and in judgments, these records serving as exhibits for business dissolution cases, debt suits, and contract disputes.
</p> 
<p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Pittsylvania County was named in honor of William Pitt, first Earl of Chatham, a great English statesman.  It was formed from Halifax County in 1766. </p>
