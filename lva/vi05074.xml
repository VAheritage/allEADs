</head>
<p>The Virginia Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers Commission was created by an act of the General Assembly in 1978. In 1985 the name of the Commission was changed to the Virginia Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers Board and in 1987 the Board was placed administratively under the Virginia Dept. of Labor and Industry. In 2004 the Board moved under the Virginia Employment Commission.
</p>
<p>The Board serves as an advisory body to the Governor and General Assembly on matters relating to the migrant and seasonal farmworker (MSFW) population in Virginia and provides a forum for the sharing of information and concerns. The Board, comprised of 15 members appointed by the Governor and approved by the General Assembly, includes representatives from the grower community, migrant and seasonal farmworkers, the general public, and public and private agencies. The Board provides coordination and evaluation of state and federal services and, to the degree feasible, other governmental, public and private agency services to migrant and seasonal farmworkers within the Commonwealth; identifies and evaluates of the needs of migrant and seasonal farmworkers, as well as the needs of their employers; identifies of the problems of the target population, provides background information, and recommends options for solutions; encourages and fosters of the development of area migrant and seasonal farmworker councils to seek problem resolution and communication at the local level.</p>
