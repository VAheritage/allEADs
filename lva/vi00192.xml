      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Letters, 1862-1864, of George Boardman Tracy (1826-1864) of
         Company E, 9th New Hampshire Infantry to his sister Carrie
         detailing his military service in the 9th New Hampshire and
         describing camp life. Tracy writes about the battles of Second
         Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Vicksburg, and
         Spotsylvania Court House. He describes the regiment's tours of
         duty in Kentucky, Mississippi, and Virginia. Tracy also
         discusses the African American population he interacted with
         during his service in Kentucky and Mississippi. His last
         letter informs his sister of his wounding at the battle of
         Spotsylvania Court House. These letters were transcribed into
         a volume by his sister. The volume also contains poems written
         by Carrie and transcriptions of two letters she wrote, one to
         her brother Alden Tracy and one to her uncle Ezra Alden on the
         1860 presidential election. Also includes a transcription of
         Ezra Alden's reply. A guide to Tracy's letters are included
         with the volume.</p>
