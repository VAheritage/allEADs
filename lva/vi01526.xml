<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Nelson County was formed in 1807 from Amherst County. The county was named for Thomas Nelson, Jr., governor of Virginia from June to November 1781.
</p>
<p>According to the "Acts of the General Assembly of the State of Virginia," Chapter 18, page 85, an act was passed on February 27th 1866 to legalize the marriages of colored persons. Colored persons who had agreed to live together as husband and wife before this date, whether they had a marriage ceremony, are considered to be legally married as of this date. Their children are considered legitimate as are the children of a couple who had stopped living together before that date due to the woman's death or other causes, but were recognized by the man to be his children. In addition, every minister and clerk must make a record of every marriage between both white and colored persons and stating in this record whether the parties are white or colored. A copy of this record must be returned to the clerk of the county within two months. The majority of marriages between free blacks, both before and after the Civil War, can be found in various county registers. The existence of a separate register, as in this county, is extremely rare.
