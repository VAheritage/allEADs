<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>New Kent County may have been named either for the English county of Kent or for Kent Island, in the upper waters of the Chesapeake Bay. William Claiborne, a native of Kent who had been driven from Kent Island by Lord Baltimore, was a prominent resident of the New Kent area around 1654 when the county was formed from York County. Part of James City County was added in 1767. 
</p>
<p>The circuit courts in Virginia were authorized by the constitution of 1851, and were established by acts passed by the General Assembly in May 1852. Theese courts were granted original jurisdiction concurrent with that of the county courts. Since 1873 they have had exclusive jurisdiction in chancery causes. The Virginia constitution of 1902 made no provision for continuing the county courts, and their original jurisdiction was given to the circuit courts effective 1 February 1904. The circuit courts still exist today, and are now the only court of record in Virginia localities.</p>
<p>Records were destroyed when John Posey set fire to the courthouse on 15 July 1787. Many records were lost when the courthouse was partially destroyed by fire during the Civil War hostilities in 1862. Additional records were burned in Richmond on 3 April 1865, where they had been moved for safekeeping during the Civil War.</p>
