      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Richmond County may have been named for Richmond borough in Surrey, England, or for Charles Lennox, first duke of Richmond and a son of King Charles II. It was formed from Old Rappahannock County in 1692. The county seat is Warsaw.
</p>
      <p>Some volumes were burned and mutilated through unknown causes; in addition, the will books prior to 1699 were missing as early as 1793, and order books for the period 1794-1816 are also missing. Numerous loose records prior to 1781 are missing as well.
</p>
      <p>In 1780 the Virginia General Assembly replaced the Anglican vestries and churchwardens of the colonial period with elected bodies called Overseers of the Poor. The Overseers provided food, clothing, shelter, and medical treatment for the persons who were too poor to support themselves or too ill to provide for their basic needs. They also bound out children whose parents could not support them or who failed to educate or instruct them, as well as orphans to become apprentices. The boys learned a trade and the girls learned domestic skills.

A brief description of each section of the county to be processioned is given. Lists of Insolvents in Lunenburg Parish for the year 1823, 1824, 1826, 1828, 1829 and for North Farnham Parish in 1824, 1826, 1828, 1829 and for Richmond County in 1827, 1834, 1835, 1840 1841, and 1842 were recorded in the book.
