<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>George Weedon was born in late 1734 in Westmoreland County, Virginia. Weedon was appointed an ensign in the Virginia militia during the French and Indian War and rose to the rank of lieutenant in 1757 and to the rank of captain lieutenant in 1762. After the war, he moved to Fredericksburg, Virginia, and married Catharine Gordon (d. 1797). He operated a tavern in Fredericksburg. Weedon was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd Virginia Regiment in January 1776 and received a commission in the continental army 13 February 1776. He was promoted to colonel in June 1776. In August 1776, he and his troops joined the continental army in New York. Appointed a brigadier general 21 February 1777, Weedon served with the army until retiring because of a dispute in rank and for his health. He was recalled to active duty in 1780 to organize and command troops in Virginia. He served at the siege of Yorktown, Virginia. After the war, Weedon returned to Fredericksburg and operated his tavern. Active in local politics, he served on Fredericksburg's council and as its mayor. Weedon died 23 December 1793 in Fredericksburg.
