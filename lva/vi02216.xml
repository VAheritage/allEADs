      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Miscellaneous Rockbridge County (Va.) Civil War Era Correspondence, 1861-1865, consist of four letters written by Confederate servicemen.
</p>
      <p>Letter, 1861, May 12, written by an unidentified soldier who served in Colonel Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson's Stonewall Brigade. He was writing from Mountain Top near Harpers Ferry. The soldier wrote about the brigade's movements towards Harpers Ferry, their readiness to fight Federal troops, sleeping in leaky tents, personal matters, and a meeting between twenty members of the Maryland legislature and Stonewall Jackson. The writer did not know what was discussed at the meeting.
</p>
      <p>Letter, 1861 Oct. 31, written by John Miller, a Confederate officer, to an unidentified official. He was writing from the "Top of Allegheny." In the letter, Miller addressed a rumour floating among his men that the allowance to their families had ended because they were now receiving pay. Miller informed the offical if the rumour was true to restore the allowance because no pay had been received.
</p>
      <p>Letter, 1862 May 16, written by Alg. S. Wade, a Confederate soldier, to Joseph G. Steele, Circuit Court Clerk of Rockbridge County. Wade wanted to Steele to assist him in being transferred (or discharged) so that he could accept an unknown position with Adolph Elhart. Wade believed that his request should be accepted stating that he had fulfilled his service time in the Confederate army and he has three brothers in the service. Wade adds a sarcastic remark writing that his brother Ben thinks that Jefferson Davis wants to wipe out the whole family.
</p>
      <p>Letter, 1864 March 5, written by E. M. Walden, a Confederate soldier, to his unidentified sister. Walden, who served in the 28th Georgia Regiment, was writing from his camp near Jacksonville, Florida. He informed his sister that he was doing well, the health and spirit of the regiment was good. Despite the fact the troops were living on cold corn bread and pickled pork, Wade wrote his sister that "we can live on bread and whip the Yankees and Yankee Negroes." He informs his sister that they recently fought the Union forces and sent them in retreat to Jacksonville perhaps referring to the Battle of Olustee. Wade told his sister that he was sending her and someone named Margaret ten dollars each. He encouraged them to spend it soon or use them to purchase confederate bonds since the money will be worthless in April.
