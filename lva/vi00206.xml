         <p>FREE NEGRO AND SLAVE RECORDS: County records were kept
         dealing specifically with free negroes, including certificates
         describing individuals and lists containing family groupings,
         ages, occupations, and residence. Information on slaves and
         blacks after the war is found in routine record sources.</p>
         <p>HENRY COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT: Henry County, Virginia, was
         formed in 1776 from Pittsylvania County and named for Patrick
         Henry. Patrick County and Martinsville were formed from it. It
         is located in Southside Virginia and adjoins Patrick County on
         the west, Franklin County on the north, Pittsylvania County on
         the east, and North Carolina on the south. The county seat is
         Martinsville.</p>
         <p>The Circuit Court was authorized by the Constitution of
         1851 and established by an act of the General Assembly passed
         in May 1852. Courts were held twice yearly in each county,
         presided over by 21 judges who rode circuits in the area of
         their jurisdiction. The records were filed with County Court
         records. These courts were granted original jurisdiction
         concurrrent with that of the County Courts, as well as
         appellate jurisdiction in all civil cases of more than fifty
         dollars and criminal cases not "expressly cognizable in some
         other court," including those involving loss of life.
         Beginning in 1873 they had exclusive jurisdiction over
         chancery cases. The Constitution of 1902 made no provision for
         the County Courts, and original jurisdiction for almost all
         matters was transferred to the Circuit Courts beginning 1
         February 1904. Likewise probate authority was transferred
         entirely to the Circuit Courts. On 15 March 1904
         responsibility for recordation of deeds was also transferred
         to the Circuit Courts. The Circuit Court thus became the sole
         court of record for Virginia localities and became the
         repository of all local public records.</p>
         <p>Prior to the establishment of the Circuit Court, the
         Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery, established in
         1831, were the upper courts on the local level. Sessions were
         held twice a year in each county, presided over by a General
         Court judge. The counties were grouped into districts for the
         convenience of the judge. This court's authority was the same
         as that of its predecessors, the Superior Courts of Law and
         the Superior Courts of Chancery. The Superior Court of Law was
         created in 1808. It met twice a year in each county, presided
         over by a circuit-riding General Court judge. Records were
         filed with the County Court. Sometimes this court was called
         Circuit Court, Circuit Court of Law, or Circuit Superior
         Court. The District Courts were created by act of the General
         Assembly in 1788 and existed until their replacement by the
         Superior Court of Law in 1808. Created to alleviate the burden
         of increasing cases before the General Court, they met
         biannually in eighteen districts around the state and were
         presided over by two General Court judges. The records were
         kept locally by the court.</p>
         <p>The Superior Courts of Chancery were created in 1802 to
         handle chancery matters initially handled by the High Court of
         Chancery. The state was divided into three chancery districts
         and cases from the counties composing the district were tried
         in a fixed location within each district. The records were
         kept in that location. Five additional districts were created
         before the court was supplanted by local Circuit Superior
         Courts of Law and Chancery in 1831. This court was sometimes
         called District Court of Chancery. The High Court of Chancery
         was created by the General Assembly in 1777 and replaced in
         1802. It handled chancery matters, meeting at the Capitol and
         had jurisdiction over the whole state. As such it is not
         strictly a local court, but was the predecessor to superior
         local courts that were created with the expansion and growth
         of the state.</p>
         <p>The County Court was the original colonial court of
         adjudication and recordation, and it was the principal
         tribunal for the administration of local justice. It was
         comprised of justices and a clerk. The justices were appointed
         and usually, especially in the colonial period, were members
         of the leading families within each county. The colonial
         county court tended to be a self-perpetuating body, new
         members often being sons or close relations of retiring or
         deceased members. The individual justices could act on small
         claims matters as well as criminal matters where imminent
         bodily harm was a possibility, there being an appeal to the
         full County Court, which met monthly. The County Court had
         authority over ophan's estates and probate. The clerk's
         responsibility was the recordation of legal matters handled by
         the court. Deeds, wills, fiduciary matters, as well as legal
         decisions were recorded by the clerk as part of his job, and
         the volumes and supporting papers for the recorded material
         were maintained by the clerk in his office as part of his
         responsibility. As previously stated, this court ceased to
         exist in 1904 and the recordation function was transferred to
         the circuit court.</p>
