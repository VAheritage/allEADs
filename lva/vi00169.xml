         <p>On May 17, 1954, the United States Supreme Court, in Brown
         v. Board of Education, Topeka, Kansas, declared segregated
         schools unconstitutional. To circumvent the court's decision,
         the Virginia General Assembly embarked on a program of
         "Massive Resistance" and passed legislation designed to close
         schools ordered to integrate. In late August 1959, Judge John
         Paul of the United States District for the Fourth Circuit
         ordered black students admitted to Warren County High School
         in Front Royal. Judge Simon E. Sobeloff of the Fourth Circuit
         Court of Appeals heard the case on appeal but refused to halt
         Judge Paul's order. Governor J. Lindsay Almond, Jr., placed
         the school under his control and ordered it closed as required
         by the massive resistance legislation. Thus, Warren County
         High School earned the dubious distinction of being the first
         Virginia school closed under the massive resistance
         legislation. In January 1959, both the federal courts and the
         Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruled that the school
         closing laws violated the United States and Virginia
         constitutions. Warren County High School reopened in late
         February, but with only twenty-two black students; the white
         students remained in the private school established when the
         high school closed. Segregationists took this to mean that the
         majority of white people desired segregated schools, and while
         some undoubtedly did, many parents refused to disrupt their
         children's education further by switching schools in mid-year.
         The segregationists circulated petitions asking the Board of
         Supervisors not to allocate funding for integrated schools for
         the 1959-1960 school term, but to no avail. In September 1959,
         white students returned to the now desegregated high
         school.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection consists of letters and petitions received
         by the Warren County Board of Supervisors from residents for
         and against public school integration. The letters, 24-27
         February and March 1959, primarily request the Board of
         Supervisors to adopt a normal school budget for the 1959-60
         school year and not close the public schools. A letter from J.
         R. Orgain, Jr., however, asks the Board of Supervisors to cut
         off funds for integrated schools. The petitions are signed by
         residents who want to maintain segregated schools and do not
         want any money appropriated to operate integrated schools.
         These petitions are either printed forms or cut out from the
         newspaper in which they appeared as paid advertisements. Also
         includes a newsletter, 24 February 1959, of the Warren County
         Committee for Public Schools clarifying why white students did
         not return to Warren County High School when the federal
         courts ordered the school re-opened and explaining that the
         remainder of the term would be substandard; and news clippings
         from the Warren Sentinel, 5 and 12 March 1959, regarding the
         petitions and an appeal from local clergy to keep the public
         schools open.</p>
