      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>John Tyler, Jr., was born on 29 March 1790 at "Greenway" in Charles City County to John Tyler, Sr., and Mary Armistead. Tyler's father, John Tyler, Sr., served as governor of Virginia from 1808 to 1811.
Graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1807, Tyler read law with his father and was admitted to the bar in 1809. Tyler was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1811, serving until 1816. During
the War of 1812, Tyler organized and led a company of militia from Charles City County. He became a member of the Council of State in 1816. Upon the death of John Clopton, Tyler was elected as a Democratic
Republican to the Fourteenth Congress and was subsequently reelected to the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Congresses. Tyler returned to the House of Delegates from 1823 to 1825 and was elected governor in 1825. Tyler
served a one-year term as governor and part of a second term, but resigned upon his election to the United States Senate on 4 March 1827. He also represented Charles City County in the Virginia Constitutional
Convention of 1829-1830. Reelected to the Senate in 1833, Tyler later resigned on 29 February 1836. While in the Senate, Tyler served as President pro tempore during the Twenty-third Congress and chairman of the
Committee on the District of Columbia and Committee on Manufactures. Tyler again returned to the Virginia House of Delegates from 1839 to 1840. In 1840, Tyler was elected Vice President of the United States as a
member of the Whig party during the presidency of William Henry Harrison. Nicknamed "His Accidency," Tyler became the first Vice President to become President upon the death of his predecessor, as Harrison died
shortly after his inauguration. Tyler did not seek reelection as President when his term expired on 3 March 1845. Tyler remained active in political life after his presidency, but did not hold office until
February 1861 when he became a delegate and president of a peace conference in Washington, D. C. Following the failure of the conference, Tyler voted for secession as a delegate in the Virginia Secession
Convention. Tyler was elected to the House of Representatives of the Confederate Congress, but died on 18 January 1862 before it assembled. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.
</p>
      <p>John Tyler was married twice. His first wife was Letitia Christian whom he married on 29 March 1813. Letitia Christian died in 1842 and Tyler was remarried to Julia Gardiner in 1844. Tyler fathered seven
children with each wife. One son, Daniel Gardiner Tyler, served as a representative from the 2nd District of Virginia in the U.S. House of Representatives. Another son, Lyon Gardiner Tyler, served in the House of
Delegates and became President of the College of William and Mary from 1888 to 1919.

Virginia's senator in Congress; Daniel Brent, Dept. of State; and James Barbour, Secretary of War.
</p>
      <p>Littleton W. Tazewell encloses a report of the Committee of Claims in the U. S. Senate rejecting the petition of Francis Larche for the value of his slave killed while impressed in the service of the United
States in the defense of New Orleans calling into question the idea of slaves as property (1826 April 24). Tyler's letter to Tazewell in response can also be found (1826 May 2). Daniel Brent served as Acting

services superintending the engraving of the general map of Virginia. Boye later writes regarding the engraving of the map and payment to Henry S. Tanner of Philadelphia (1826 Jan. 23). In addition, Boye writes
