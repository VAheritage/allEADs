      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
      <p>Grayson County was named for William Grayson, a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1784 to 1787 and one of the first two United States senators from Virginia. It was formed from Wythe County by a statute adopted on 7 November 1792. The county court first met on 21 May 1793. A portion of Patrick County was added in 1810. The county seat is Independence.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Grayson County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1795-1899, are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
      <p>Chancery cases are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>  William Carrico and his wife Martha were separated. His son Harvy claimed his father gave him a tract of land to support of Harvy's mother, Martha Carrico. On December 28, 1854, William Carrico married Elesay (Louisa) Forkner (Fortner) in Grayson County, Virginia. He claimed to be a widower and she claimed to be a widow. He was born in Grayson County and she was born in Surry County, North Carolina. According to the deposition of Hardin Hickman, Louisa Forkner was the wife of Jefferson Forkner who moved from North Carolina to Missouri and afterwards to the Kansas Territory. Mr. Hickman last heard from Jefferson Forkner in November 1857. Joseph Parker's deposition states that Jefferson Forkner sold his wife, Louisa to William Carico for five dollars and gave him a bill of sale for her. Mr. Parker was a witness to the bill of sale. Mr. Carico then took Louisa to Grayson County to live. Jessee Riggs' deposition stated that he attended the marriage of Jefferson Forkner and Louisa Parker in 1835 at the house of Squire Jarvis in Surry County, North Carolina. There are other depositions included in this Chancery Cause that give more information about Mrs. Martha Carrico, Jefferson Forkner, William Carrico, and Mrs. Forkner Carrico's children.
