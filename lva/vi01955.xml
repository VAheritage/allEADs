<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Wyndham Robertson was born in Richmond, Virginia, on 26 January 1803 to William Robertson and Elizabeth Bolling, a descendant of Pocahontas.  Wyndham was graduated at William and Mary College in 1821 and was admitted to the bar in 1824.  Robertson was elected to the Council of State on 29 May 1830, and later re-elected in 1833 and 1836.  As senior member of the Council and lieutenant governor, Robertson succeeded Littleton W. Tazewell as governor upon his resignation on 30 March 1836.  Robertson served as governor until Tazewell's three-year term expired on 31 March 1837.  In 1838, Robertson was elected to represent Richmond City in the House of Delegates serving four consecutive sessions until 1841.  Robertson relocated to southwest Virginia, but later returned to serve in the House of Delegates on the eve of the Civil War.  An opponent of secession, Robertson introduced the Anti-Coercion Resolution pledging Virginia's support against Federal coercion.  Robertson remained in the House of Delegates throughout the war.   Following the war, Robertson was instrumental in Virginia's readmission to the Union as a member of the Committee of Nine.  
</p>
<p>Wyndham Robertson married Mary Trigg Smith, daughter of Capt. Francis Smith, on 16 August 1831.  He died on 11 February 1888 and is buried in the Bolling Family Cemetery at Cobbs in Chesterfield County, Virginia.
