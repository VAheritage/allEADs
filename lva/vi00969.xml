      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>James Stuart Gilmore III was elected Virginia's 68th Governor in November 1997 and served in this capacity from January 1998 to January 2002. Jim Gilmore was born in Richmond, Virginia, on October 6, 1949. He graduated from the University of Virginia in 1971 with a degree in Foreign Policy and then joined the U.S. Army, where he then graduated with honors from the Army Intelligence School. He joined the 650th Military Intelligence Group and was stationed in West Germany. After his tour was completed, he entered law school at the University of Virginia and graduated in 1977. Jim Gilmore was elected in 1987 as Commonwealth's Attorney for Henrico County, was reelected in 1991 and was elected Virginia's Attorney General in 1993. He is married to the former Roxane Gatling of Suffolk.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The Records of the Policy Office of Governor James S. Gilmore are housed in 15 boxes. The collection is arranged into twelve series. Series have been designated for: I. Secretary of Administration; II. Secretary of Commerce and Trade; III. Secretary of Education; IV. Secretary of Finance; V. Secretary of Health and Human Resources; VI. Secretary of Natural Resources; VII. Secretary of Public Safety; VIII. Secretary of Technology; IX. Secretary of Transportation; X. Miscellaneous; XI. Records of Lee E. Goodman; and XII. Policy Analysis.
</p>
      <p>This is an artificial collection compiled by Governor James S. Gilmore. In the 2002 November 18 agreement between former Governor Gilmore and the Library of Virginia, Governor Gilmore agreed to transfer 25 boxes of Policy Files from the Policy Office. While these records were called "policy files" by Governor Gilmore's representatives, the majority of these documents were not actually created by the Policy Office. Most of the records within this series are copies of documents created by Governor Gilmore's cabinet secretaries and the state agencies under their control. In the summer of 2001, John A. Mahone, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, apparently requested each cabinet secretary to gather documents for the Governor's personal files documenting the administration's achievements. (For examples of responses to this request see Box 1, Folder 30; Box 3, Folder 32; Box 5, Folder 21 and Box 6, Folder 9) This series represents those collected documents. Also interfiled with this material are a few of Governor Gilmore's briefing books. Only a small number of documents in this series were actually created by the policy office and very few of them are restricted by executive privilege.
