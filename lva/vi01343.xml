<p>R. L. Davidson and Brother was a general store that conducted business in Scott County, Virginia during the late nineteenth century. The co-partnership was formed by Robert L. Davidson and his brother William
D. Davidson on August 1, 1889, in the town of Estilleville, now Gate City, Virginia. The co-partnership was dissolved in July 6, 1896, due to a falling out between the two brothers over Robert's personal
misconduct.
</p>
<p>The volumes were used as exhibits as part of the deposition of W. D. Davidson in the chancery case R. L. Davidson versus W. D. Davidson, heard in the Circuit Court of Scott County. The two ledgers identified as
Book 1 and Book 2 were labelled "Exhibit E" and "Exhibit F." The four daybooks were were assigned exhibit numbers "4," "7," "8," and "13." The bank and receipt book was labelled "Exhibit A."
