      <head>Historical Information
</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Franklin County was named for Benjamin Franklin and was formed from Bedford and Henry counties in 1785. The county court first met on January 2, 1786. Part of Patrick County was added in 1848. The county seat is Rocky Mount.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Franklin County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1787-1934, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.

          <p>Nancy Ferguson entrusted Thomas B. Ferguson, her nephew, with running the day-to-day affairs of her estate. This included supervision of numerous people enslaved by Nancy. According to Nancy, her predilection for “excessive and constant indulgence in the use of ardent spirits” allowed Thomas to defraud her of several enslaved persons. She claimed that the deed of gift in which she transferred the enslaved persons to Thomas was void because he had plied her with liquor and taken advantage of her weakened condition.
