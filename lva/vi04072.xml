      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Washington County was named for George Washington who had been commander in chief of the Continental army for little more than a year when the county was formed from Fincastle County in 1776. The county court first met on 28 January 1777. A part of Montgomery County was added in 1777.
</p>
      <p>Minute books for the periods 1787-1819 and 1821-1837 and many loose papers were lost in a courthouse fire set by Union soldier James Wyatt on 15 December 1864 during the Civil War. Wyatt, who was raised in Washington County, sought revenge for what he claimed was a wrong done against him by a county court judge before the war.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Washington County (Va.) Recorded and Unrecorded Deeds, 1799-1882 (bulk 1863-1882), consist of deeds of bargain and sale, deeds of gift, homestead mortgages, and deeds of trust both recorded and unrecorded. Recorded deeds were proved and recorded in deed books. Unrecorded deeds were never proved and recorded in deed books. A few of the deeds include plats.
</p>
      <p>Deeds of bargain and sale are the most commonly recorded deed in which one individual sells property, usually land, but occasionally personal property, to another individual. Such deeds show the names of the grantor and grantee, the residence of both parties, a description of what is being sold, the consideration (or price), the location of the tract of land, the tract's boundaries, and any limitations on the property being sold. The deed was signed by the grantor, and possibly his wife or anyone else having a claim to the property, and by at least two witnesses. Appended to the deed may be a memorandum of livery of seisin, stating that the property has changed hands and that peaceful possession has taken place.
</p>
      <p>Deeds of gift are often found transferring property, either real or personal, from one individual to another "for love and affection." The degree of kinship, if any, between the grantor and grantee is sometimes stated.
</p>
      <p>Additional loose records were filed with deeds and were recorded in the deed books. They include the following: copies of chancery decrees, mechanic's liens, bankruptcies, and powers of attorney.
