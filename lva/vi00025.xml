        <p>At an earlier date, photographs, broadsides, and a few
            miscellaneous items of the R.F.&amp; P. Collection had been
            donated to the Science Museum of Virginia along with other
            R.F.&amp; P. artifacts. In July 2000 the Science Museum
            transferred those predominantly visual records to the
            Library of Virginia (Accession 37441). Since all items of
            Accession 37441 are integral parts of the R.F.&amp; P.
            company records, they have been interfiled with Accession
            36460, and one Accession number, 36460, is used to identify
            and describe the entire collection.</p>

      </list>
      <p>The Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad
         (R.F.&amp; P. R.R.) was incorporated by an Act of the General
         Assembly of Virginia on 25 February 1834. It was at the time
         the sixth railroad to be chartered in Virginia. The company's
         purpose was to provide rail service from Richmond to the
         Potomac River near Washington, D.C. In 1835 the General
         Assembly authorized the subscription to two fifths of the
         Company stock. The State was proportionally represented with
         two Directors out of five on the Company's Board. Throughout a
         large part of the company's history the State of Virginia
         guarded its interest in the R.F.&amp; P. by prohibiting other
         railroads to parallel the route of the R.F.&amp; P. In 1836
         the tracks from Richmond to South Anna were completed, in 1837
         the extension to Fredericksburg. Service for the Post Office
         began in 1838, increasing the line's traffic. In 1842
         construction of the line was finished up to Aquia Creek,
         eliminating the use of a stage coach. From Aquia Creek the
         Washington &amp; Fredericksburg Steamboat Co. provided the
         transportation to Washington. The R.F.&amp; P. R.R. bought
         half of the Steamer Co.'s stock in 1845. With the goal of an
         eventual all-rail connection between Richmond and Washington
         in mind, the Alexandria &amp; Fredericksburg R.R. Co was
         incorporated in 1851. With the completion of its line to
         Quantico in 1872, a continuous rail connection from NC to
         Baltimore had been established. The Potomac R.R. Co. lines
         were completed the same year and provided connecting service
         between the R.F.&amp; P. R.R. and the A.&amp; F. R.R. Co. For
         a few years, the new all-rail line was used alternating with
         the route that included the Potomac Steamboat Co., the
         successor of the Washington &amp; Fredericksburg Steamboat
         Co., until in 1877 the R.F.&amp; P. terminated its steamboat
         contract and turned its shares back over to that Company.</p>
      <p>During the Civil War, the R.F.&amp; P. R.R. operated
         largely in the service of the Confederate Army. The damage
         inflicted to equipment, tracks, bridges and buildings was
         considerable.</p>
      <p>In the mid 1880's the company prospered again. In 1887 the
         Richmond Byrd St. Station was opened to accommodate the
         increased traffic volume of the R.F.&amp; P.R.R. Co. and the
         Richmond and Petersburg R.R. Co. (R.&amp; P. R.R. Co.). In
         1888 a timely freight service for fresh fruit and vegetables
         was inaugurated, a business that should grow fast and steadily
         well into the 20th century. The same year authorization for a
         branch line was granted to these two railroad companies, so
         the growing volume of freight could be directed away from the
         city.</p>
      <p>The R.F.&amp; P. R.R., traditionally a short line railroad,
         had always relied on agreements with other railroad lines
         providing service south of Richmond and north of Washington,
         and in 1900, after several smaller lines had been grouped
         together, those railroads were: Seaboard Air Line R.Y. (from
         Portsmouth and southeast), Atlantic Coast Line R.R. (south of
         Richmond) and the Washington Southern R.Y. Co. (from Quantico
         to Washington, controlled by the Pennsylvania R.R. Co.). In
         1901, Seaboard Air Line R.Y., Atlantic Coast Line R.R., the
         Pennsylvania R.R., the Southern R.Y. Co., the Chesapeake and
         Ohio R.Y. Co., as well as the Baltimore and Ohio R.Y. Co.
         agreed to form the Richmond-Washington Co. That Company
         acquired the entire stock of the Washington Southern R.Y. Co.
         and the majority of R.F.&amp; P.'s voting stock. The six
         partner would all be treated equally and have the same rights
         in the dealings with the R.F.&amp; P. The R.F.&amp; P. and
         Washington Southern R.Y. Co. came under common management at
         his point, and operated jointly as the "Richmond-Washington
         Line." For the next two decades the R.F.&amp; P. kept
         expanding and modernizing at a rapid pace. The Richmond
         Terminal R.Y. Co. was chartered in 1916 with the purpose of
         constructing and operating a passenger terminal, and in 1919
         Broad St. passenger station (architect: John Russell Pope) was
         completed. R.F.&amp; P. and Atlantic Coast Line R.R. both
         owned equal amounts of the Richmond Terminal Co.'s shares.</p>
      <p>Starting in December 1917, the R.F.&amp; P. R.R. and the
         Washington Southern R.Y. Co. came under Federal Control for 26
         months, and played an important role in the transportation of
         military personnel and equipment.</p>
      <p>Three years later, in 1920, the Washington Southern R.Y.
         Co., which had been managed jointly with the R.F.&amp; P.
         since 1901, was completely merged into the latter. A large
         freight terminal was added to the Acca Freight Yards in 1924,
         tracks were improved and cars and locomotives modernized. The
         growing competition of automobiles on shorter distances
         prompted the R.F.&amp; P. in 1928 to halt its less and less
         efficient steam train service between Richmond and Ashland and
         to replace it with a passenger bus service. Thus the Suburban
         Motor Coach Co. was incorporated the same year, the R.F.&amp;
         P. R.R. being the main shareholder. Soon passenger bus travel
         was introduced between Washington and various places south of
         Alexandria, and the R.F.&amp; P. Transportation Co. was
         chartered in 1929. It was fully owned by the R.F.&amp; P. R.R.
         and the Suburban Motor Coach Co. merged into the R.F.&amp; P.
         Transportation Co. in March of the same year. In August 1929,
         the R.F.&amp; P. Transportation Co. and the competing
         Richmond- Washington Motor Coaches (owned by the Greyhound
         Co.) merged to form the Richmond-Greyhound Lines, Inc. Service
         was soon expanded to reach from Washington to Norfolk. During
         the Depression years, the R.F.&amp; P. struggled with reduced
         passenger and freight service revenues, challenges which the
         company tried to meet by reducing it's passenger fares as well
         as attempting to join the developing market for truck service
         business.</p>
      <p>Starting in 1931 the R.F.&amp; P. Transportation Co.
         experimented with truck freight service between Richmond and
         Washington, but discontinued the operation due to lack of
         profits in 1939.</p>
      <p>Traffic of passengers and freight reached a high during
         WWII, and considerable investments were made to modernize
         engines and rail yards. After 1945 passenger travel decreased
         steadily, and Amtrak finally serviced that part of the
         operation in 1970. With the foundation of the Richmond Holding
         Company in 1957 the R.F.&amp; P. had started to pursue another
         business avenue. Although the R.F.&amp; P. had always been
         involved in Real Estate deals, and was the sole stockholder of
         the Richmond Land Corp. (inc. 1901), it had done so only for
         the purpose of securing and developing land for the expansion
         of its rail service. Now the Real Estate and Land Development
         Business should become an enterprise in its own right. Other
         important development of the 1960's and 1970's were the
         opening of Bryan Park Terminal (1962), the purchase and
         subsequent development of the Dahlgreen Railroad line and
         adjacent properties (1964), and the move to the new Main
         Office building at Acca Yard (1976). At this point, the
         Richmond Terminal R.Y. Co. was dissolved, and Broad Street
         Station - no longer in usage - was sold to the Commonwealth of
         Virginia. By the early 1980's ownership of the
         Richmond-Washington Co. and with it of the R.F.&amp; P. had
         changed: now the Commonwealth of Virginia, Seaboard Coast Line
         Railroad, Southern Railway, and Chessie System Railroad all
         shared the capital stock. R.F.&amp; P.'s most important rail
         freight connections at that time were Seaboard Coast Line
         Railroad and Conrail. Despite continued modernization and
         collaboration with other carriers, earnings of the real estate
         branch outgrew those of the freight sector by the mid 1980's.
         Those changed realities let to a major company restructuring
         in 1988 with the founding of the R.F.&amp; P. Corporation, a
         publicly owned, Virginia-based holding company that controlled
         the R.F.&amp; P. R.R. and R.F.&amp; P. Properties, a real
         estate investment, leasing and development company. Already
         before the reorganization, the CSX Corporation (formed through
         a merger of Chessie System and Seabord Coastline Industries in
         1980), which owned the majority of the Richmond-Washington
         Co., and thus controlled the R.F.&amp; P. Co., had been
         interested merging the R.F.&amp; P.R.R. Co. entirely into its
         own enterprise. At this time the Commonwealth of Virginia,
         through the Virginia Retirement System (VRS) still held a 20%
         interest in the R.F.&amp; P. After one failed merger attempt
         in early 1990, CSX and the VRS, which owned about 27 % of
         R.F.&amp; P. Corporation stock by now, came to the following
         agreement in August of 1991: the VRS, through its subsidiary
         Systems Holdings, acquired 99 percent of the R.F.&amp; P.
         Corporation's shares. It then sold the R.F.&amp; P. R.R. to
         CSX Transportation, which fully merged it into its own railway
         line. This transaction factually ended the 157 year history of
         the R.F.&amp; P. R.R. The remaining part of the R.F.&amp; P.
         Corporation, the Real Estate business came under the control
         of the VRS, and was subsequently sold to Commonwealth Atlantic
         Properties.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The records of the R.F.&amp; P. R.R., 1834-1997, are
         organized into 31 series. Series I-X relate to record groups
         of the R.F.&amp; P. R.R. itself, series XI-XXXI describe the
         records of R.F.&amp; P. subsidiaries, both fully or partially
         owned, and of companies, of which the R.F.&amp; P. owned a
         smaller interest at some point during its 157 year history, or
         with which it was otherwise affiliated. These include:
         Alexandria &amp; Fredericksburg R.Y. Co., Alexandria &amp;
         Washington R.Y. Co., Fruit Growers Express Co., Lewis Ginter
         Land and Improvement Co., Potomac R.R. Co., Potomac Steamboat
         Co., The Pullman Co., R.F.&amp; P. Transportation Co.,
         Richmond-Greyhound Lines, Richmond Holding Corporation,
         Richmond Land Corporation, Richmond Terminal R.Y. Co.,
         Seaboard Air Line R.R. Co., South Washington Land Corporation,
         Suburban Motor Coach Co., Trailer Train Co., Union Terminal
         Corporation, Washington and Fredericksburg Steamboat Co.,
         Virginia and Carolina R.R. Co., and the Washington Southern
         R.Y. Co. Also included are some records for the
         Richmond-Washington Co., which at times held the majority of
         R.F.&amp; P. voting stock. In some cases information for
         subsidiary companies can be found as integral part of the
         R.F.&amp; P. files.</p>
      <p>The main record types found in this collection are minute
         books and minute files (the complete run of R.F.&amp; P.
         Minute books, from 1834-1981 is especially noteworthy); legal
         files, like charters, bylaws, agreements, cases, contracts and
         deeds, and real estate files; as well as a substantial amount
         of financial files, like annual reports, audits, balances,
         check registers, daybooks, journals, ledgers, property
         records, security records, and tax records. To a lesser extent
         records of operating, transportation, and technical
         departments, some newsletters and corporate histories, as well
         as photographs are included. There are only a few singular
         correspondence files and letter books.</p>
      <p>The collection includes records for 21 additional
         companies. Some are wholly owned subsidiaries, others were
         merged into R.F. &amp; P. R.R., or are predecessor companies
         of those who merged with the R.F.&amp; P. Yet another group of
         companies was affiliated with the R.F.&amp; P. through a
         partial ownership of interest. The amount of records for those
         associated companied varies greatly. For some there is only a
         minute book or a few annual reports or security records. For
         others, the holdings are more extensive and a variety of
         record groups is present. The companies that have a larger
         share of records in this collection are the Richmond Land
         Corp., the Richmond Terminal R.Y. Co., and the Washington
         Southern R.Y. Co.</p>
      <p>Several items of the collection were in need of
         restoration, which was performed by Etherington Conservation
         Center, either in the in-house lab, or in the North Carolina
         main office. The conservation work necessary consisted mainly
         of repairs of broken, torn and glued pages, damaged bindings,
         the cleaning of moldy volumes, and the preparation custom
         boxes to house fragile volumes, and those without binding.</p>

      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>The arrangement of series attempts to reflect the company's
         internal structure by following the organization of main
         divisions in its outline and by keeping the original order of
         documents wherever it was still present, or where it could be
         reconstructed due to internal filing numbers, file labeling,
         etc. Headings for files or filing units were also kept as
         found, whenever present. The arrangement within each series
         and subseries will be specified in the Series Description
         below. Miscellaneous files are placed at the end of each
         respective series or subseries. The predominant description
         level is at the folder and volume level. Exceptions are the
         photographs and broadsides, which are described at the item
         level. While the more then 300 photographs make up their own
         record group, the broadsides are inventoried under the
         Transportation and Public Relations, Advertising, and
         Marketing Departments.</p>
      <p>The collection is housed in 347 boxes (including one
         oversize), and two map cabinet drawers. 177 volumes are
         shelved. Whenever size permitted, volumes were housed in boxes
         for better protection (353 volumes). Volumes that are placed
         directly on the shelves are interfiled with the boxes,
         following the order of the container listing (see below).</p>
      <p>Oversize items are filed in one oversize box (No 344) as
         well as in two map cabinet drawers. There are a total of 39
         oversize folders, containing various numbers of oversize
         items. Oversize items, which were part of a regular sized
         filing unit, were removed from their respective folders. In
         their place removal notices list the item(s) separated and the
         oversize folder number to which they have been moved. For
         location and content list of oversize folders see Appendix A.

          <p>This series is made up of five subseries: Charters
               and Bylaws; Cases, Claims, and Dockets; Contracts; Real
               Estate Files; and Miscellaneous Files. In addition to a
               copy of the 1834 Charter, this collection contains
               several amended versions (1924, 1949), as well as
               various Bylaws (1947-1983). The case files, 1981-1992,
               concern cases in state and federal courts, and contain
               briefs, appendices, petitions, pleadings, trial
               transcripts, motions, and statements of facts. They are
               organized by court and within chronologically. The
               entries in the two Claim Books, 1888-1889 concern
               compensation requests by customers, predominantly for
               loss or damage of freight, entered on a daily basis. The
               dockets, 1920-1938, issued by and addressed to the
               Interstate Commerce Commission deal predominantly with
               property valuation issues. Included is one
               correspondence file, 1968. Contracts, 1867-1969, include
               contract files, 1871-1969 (agreements, merger
               agreements, contracts, deeds, mortgages, statements,
               certified extracts of minutes, trusts; in many cases
               amendments, additions, and revisions - organized
               according to internal numbering system) and mixed
               volumes, 1867-1950 that are composed of a mixed set of
               legal documents, as well as Credit Bond Files, n.d.,
               1916-1942. This subseries gives a good impression of
               the business relationships, clients, and partners of the
               R.F.&amp; P. The following subseries, the Real Estate
               Files, n.d., 1929-1986, includes copies and drafts of
               agreements, deeds, correspondence, plats and plans,</p>

          <p>Financial Files are organized into 4 subseries:
               Treasurer's Files; Accounting and Bookkeeping;
               Securities; and Taxes. The financial records make up the
               bulk of this collection. Treasurer's files include
               information on R.F. &amp; P. securities owned, the
               company's 1941 re-funding, as well as financial aspects
               of the company's transition to CSX, and financial
               statements prepared for the Board.</p>
          <p>The Accounting and Bookkeeping section is divided
               into 11 categories: Accounts, n.d., ca. 1834-1978
               contains information on expenses for various projects;
               Annual Reports, 1836-1995, consists of reports to the
               stockholders, with the exception of one report from 1839
               addressed to the Board of Public Works (which held two
               fifth of the stock at that time) and one report for
               Richmond and Petersburg R.R. Co. for the year 1861 -
               there are volumes for individual years, multiple years,
               volumes that are bound with proceedings, statement,
               mortgages, etc., as well as reports for R.F. &amp; P.
               and the Washington Southern R.Y. combined, for the years
               the two companies were managed together, 1901-1920;
               Auditor's reports are included for the years 1908-1965;
               Balances, 1834-1916, include Balance Sheets and
               Financial Analysis, as well as General Balance Sheets
               and Financial Analysis and one Trial Balance volume.
               Check Registers, 1907-1941; Day Books, 1860-1905; Income
               and Expenses, 1926-1972; Journals, 1834-1960; Ledgers,
               1905-1960; and Vouchers, document the ongoing financial
               dealings and activities of the R.F. &amp; P. Journals
               record costs of road repair depot and train expenses,
               bills payable, petty accounts, and interest on bonds,
               certificates of debt, and dividends paid; ledgers record
               assets, investments, debits, liabilities, surplus,
               credits, profit &amp; loss, income, etc. The section on
               Properties, ca. 1973-1992, throws light on the type of
               properties owned and the many financial aspects involved
               including valuation, betterment and depreciation, by
               recording and analyzing specific types of financial and
               technical data. An exception is the Inventory of
               Property, 1873, which includes plans and drawings, in
               addition to listings of various other properties.</p>
          <p>The subseries Securities, 1834-1957, contains a
               large number of certificates, registers, and transfer
               books, for Bonds, 1866-1939; Certificates of Debt,
               1844-1901; Dividends, 1861-1957; and Stocks, 1834-1975.
               They provide a good insight into financial status and
               ownership of the company at different points in its
               history.</p>
          <p>Tax records cover the period 1914-1992. Until an
               agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1912, the
               R.F. &amp; P. had a tax exempt status. Federal Tax
               Returns include for the most part copies of returns,
               instructions, schedules, income statements, worksheets,
               receipts, correspondence, balance sheets, etc. For some
               years, records of wholly-owned subsidiaries, like
               Richmond Land Corp. and Washington Southern R.Y. Co. are
               included as well. State Tax Returns and Rolling Stock
               Information include copies of returns, schedules, and in
               some cases statement of property value and taxes
               extended made by the State Corporation Commission of
               Virginia. Included are also two filing units, 1980-1992,
               that deal with Real Estate and Property tax questions,
               and miscellaneous tax subject files, 1914-1973.</p>

          <p>This series is divided into three subseries: A. Engineering; B. Research; and C. New Technologies. Of
               note are one volume of drawings and specifications of
               sections for bridge construction, 1903-1907, and two record
               books, 1889-1890, for the construction of the James River
               Branch. Those volumes also include data for the James
               River Bridge. The collection also comprises plans and
               drawings for about 500 architectural and engineering
               projects, which will have been separated from the main
               body of the collection and which will be described
               separately by the Library of Virginia's architectural
               records archivist. See also Series IX: Photographs.</p>

            <p>There are 58 Broad Street Station photographs, dating from about 1919 to the
               1960's. Many photographs are undated, but most dates can
               be narrowed down by comparison with dated images, and by
               evidence such as the styles of cars and clothing. Images
               include exterior and aerial views from different angles,
               as well as waiting rooms, dining rooms, a Christmas
               scene, and a ticket counter.</p>

            <p>The 36 images in the Steam Locomotive group also comprise rail yard
               pictures, and several passenger cars, as well as the
               Cannonball Wreck at Dunlop Station, 1903. The steam
               engines depicted are from a line of engines acquired in
               the late 1930's and early 1940's. The freight train
               engines were named after Confederate generals, the
               passenger train engines after governors. Most engines
               depicted date from the 1920's through 1940's.</p>

               register, 1870-1889, give information on the ownership

          <p>Incorporated in 1890 through the consolidation of A
               &amp; F R.Y. and A &amp; W R.Y.. This series consists of
               minutes, legal files, financial files, and miscellaneous
               files. The two volumes of Board of Directors and
               Stockholders Meeting Minutes, 1890-1920 cover the
               company's thirty years of existence, the Minutes of the
               Potomac Yard Advisory Board, 1909-1925 continue for 5
               years after the Washington Southern R.Y. Co. was merged
               completely into the R.F.&amp; P., which took over its
               place on the Board. The Advisory Board was made up of
               all five railroad companies using Potomac Yard. In
               addition to the Washington Southern R.Y. Co., those were
               the Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co., the Chesapeake &amp;
               Ohio R.Y. Co., the Philadelphia, Baltimore &amp;
               Washington R.R. Co. and the Southern R.Y. Co. Legal
               records, 1871-1917 include copies of charter, bylaws and
               mortgages, an indexed volume of contracts and
               agreements, as well as about 150 deeds. Also included
               are pre-1890 deeds that were made by one of the
               company's predecessors, the Alexandria &amp;
               Fredericksburg R.Y. Co. (see above). Financial files,
               1890-1921 include Treasurer's correspondence, accounting
               and bookkeeping records, and securities. The
               correspondence is made up of one letter book, 1890-1904;
               the accounting and bookkeeping records contain annual
               reports, balances, betterments, check registers,
               journals, and ledgers. The securities subseries
               includes stock and bonds ledgers, transfers and
               certificates as well as 4% and 5% gold and mortgage
               bonds. The miscellaneous file contains a brief corporate
               history until 1907. R.F. &amp; P. tax records also
               include data for Washington Southern R.Y.</p>
