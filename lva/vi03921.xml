      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Washington County is the first locality in the United States known to have been named for George Washington.  It was formed from Fincastle County in 1776, and a part of Montgomery County was added in 1777.
</p>
      <p>Created by an act of 1776, court first met on 18 January 1777. Minute books for the periods 1787-1819 and 1821-1837 and many loose papers were lost in a courthouse fire set by Union soldier James Wyatt on 15 December 1864 during the Civil War. Wyatt, who was raised in Washington County, sought revenge for what he claimed was a wrong done against him by a county court judge before the war.
