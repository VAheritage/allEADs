<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Paton and Butcher was a mercantile business formed in 1775 by John B. Paton and John Butcher and conducted business in Alexandria, Virginia.  It sold iron products such as nails, tongs, horse shears, knives, scissors, locks, screws, pots, fish hooks, and kettles.  John B. Paton's son William became a partner in the business in 1810. John Butcher died in 1803 leaving his share of the business to his nephew Jonathan Butcher.  John B. Paton died in 1819.  The surviving partners William Paton and Jonathan Butcher continued the partnership until it was dissolved in 1825 March 11 following the death of William Paton.
</p>
<p>Paton and Butcher also owned interest in two other businesses in Alexandria, Virginia, John W. Massie and Company and Ezra Kinsey and Company.
</p>
<p>The volumes were used as exhibits in a chancery suit, William H. Irwin and others versus Charles McKnight and others, heard in the Circuit Court of Alexandria County during the 1840's and 1850's.
</p>
<p>Arlington County was originally named Alexandria County. It was formed from a part of Fairfax County that was ceded to the U.S. government in 1789 but was returned to Virginia in 1846. The county name was changed in 1920 to Arlington, the name of the Custis family mansion (former home of Robert E. Lee), which is located in the county.
</p>
<p>Alexandria, in Fairfax and Arlington counties, was named for John Alexander, an early owner of the tract on the which the town was located. Alexandria was established in 1749. Its site had been known as Hunting Creek Warehouse and as Bellhaven. Alexandria was incorporated as a town in 1779 and in 1789, Alexandria was ceded to the District of Columbia. Formally accepted by Congress in 1801, Alexandria remained under a part of the District until 1847 when it reverted to Virginia. In 1852 Alexandria was incorporatedas a city.
