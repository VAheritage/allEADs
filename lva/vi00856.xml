         <p>Following John Brown's Raid on Harper's Ferry, the General
         Assembly passed "an act making an appropriation for the
         purchase and manufacture of arms and munitions of war" on
         January 1, 1860. A Board of Commissioners, to consist of three
         members appointed by the governor, was formed to carry out
         this undertaking. The three men appointed by Governor Letcher
         were Colonel Philip St. George Cocke, Colonel Francis H.
         Smith, and Captain George W. Randolph.</p>
         <p>The purpose of the Board was to propose a plan to make the
         buildings of the public armory in Richmond fit for the
         manufacture and repair of arms and munitions for the use of
         the militia. The governor was authorized to employ a Master
         Armourer to direct the operations. The commissioners visited
         armories and weapon factories to research arms manufacture. In
         Washington, the commissioners met with Col. H.K. Craig, Chief
         of the Ordinance Department of the U.S. Army as well as
         Captain J.A. Dahlgren of the U.S. Navy. Governor Letcher
         accompanied the commissioners on another trip to Springfield,
         Mass., and West Point, New York. The commissioners purchased a
         variety of arms and sent them to the Virginia Military
         Institute in order to conduct tests on the weapons. The
         commissioners negotiated a contract with both James T. Ames of
         the Chicopee Manufacturing Company and Joseph R. Anderson of
         the Tredegar Iron Works to retool the public armory to produce
         arms at an output of 5,000 rifled muskets per annum. The Board
         eventually decided to contract with Anderson.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The Board of Commissioners' journal records the activities
         of the commissioners from February 10 to December 7, 1860.
         Entries were made in the journal detailing the commissioners'
         travels to Washington, Harper's Ferry, Massachusetts, and New
         York in order to consult with government officials and weapon
         makers regarding arms and arms manufacture. The journal also
         contains transcribed correspondence regarding the purchase of
         arms. Transcribed reports to Governor Letcher provide the
         Board's recommendations for the armory. There are also
         proceedings of the negotiations with Joseph R. Anderson and
         James T. Ames regarding a contract to outfit and produce the
         arms in the armory. Proposed contracts with both Anderson and
         Ames provide estimates for the machinery. An extensive report
         by Major R.E. Colston of the Virginia Military Institute
         concerns comparison tests conducted on small arms including
         Burnside's Carbine, Smith &amp; Pultneys Carbine, the Maynard
         Rifle, and the U.S. Harper's Ferry Rifle. Colston rated each
         for accuracy, solidity and strength, simplicity of
         construction, cost, facility of loading, and rapidity of fire.
         Colston includes diagrams showing the "spread" for each weapon
         fired at 500 yards.</p>
