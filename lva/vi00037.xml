      <head>Historical Information</head>
      <p>The summer of 1963 witnessed a wave of civil rights
         demonstrations throughout the nation. In Danville, Virginia,
         the leaders of the Danville Southern Christian Leadership
         Conference (SCLC), inspired by events in Birmingham, Alabama,
         organized a series of protests of their own. Rev. Lawrence G.
         Campbell, Rev. Alexander I. Dunlap, Julius E. Adams, and
         Arthur Pinchback, believing that the Danville NAACP under the
         leadership of Doyle Thomas was too conservative, had founded
         the Danville SCLC in 1960. These men, along with Rev. Lendall
         W. Chase, president of the Danville SCLC, took the lead in
         promoting civil rights in Danville, a city deep in Virginia's
         black belt and strong in segregationist sentiment.</p>
      <p>Throughout 1962, they repeatedly appeared before the
         Danville City Council to demand black representation on the
         boards of city agencies and the end of segregation. In August
         1962, Campbell, Dunlap, Adams, and Chase signed the Danville
         Omnibus Integration Suit, filed in federal court, that called
         for the integration of Danville's hospitals, schools,
         cemeteries, public buildings, public housing projects,
         teaching assignments, and city employment opportunities. On
         January 1, 1963, Dunlap, Chase, Campbell, Adams, and Pinchback
         were arrested at a segregated Howard Johnson restaurant for
         trespassing after refusing to leave when the manager asked
         them to do so. In March, Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke at a
         meeting of the Danville SCLC.</p>
      <p>On May 31, the Danville civil rights demonstrations began
         peacefully and ended without incident. Police did not make any
         arrests and the local press ignored the demonstration. The
         majority of the demonstrators were teenagers led by Thurman
         Echols and Ezell Barksdale. On June 5, the demonstrations
         became more unruly as the participants impeded traffic by
         sitting down on a main street. Judge Archibald M. Aiken, judge
         of the Danville Corporation Court, was summoned by police to
         the scene and commanded the demonstrators to disperse. The
         demonstrators, however, refused, prompting Aiken to issue a
         temporary injunction the next day that ordered the
         demonstrators to desist from, among other things, assembling
         in an unlawful manner, interfering with traffic and business,
         obstructing entrances to businesses and public buildings,
         participating and inciting mob violence, and using loud
         language that disrupts the peace. The injunction, made
         permanent a few weeks later, formed the basis for many of the
         arrests made that summer.</p>
      <p>In addition to the injunction, Danville used other methods
         to quell the demonstrations. A special grand jury, convened by
         Aiken, indicted the demonstration leaders on June 7 under a
         slavery-era law called "John Brown's Law" that made inciting
         "the colored population to acts of violence or war against the
         white population" illegal. In mid-June and early July, the
         Danville city council, under the leadership of councilman John
         W. Carter, an attorney and staunch segregationist, adopted two
         ordinances designed to limit the demonstrations. One limited
         the size, place, and time of demonstrations and the other
         required a permit to parade.</p>
      <p>Despite Aiken's and the city council's attempts, the
         demonstrations continued. Civil rights activists from the
         Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the
         Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), including field
         secretaries Bob Zellner, Ivanhoe Donaldson, Avon Rollins, and
         Daniel Foss of SNCC, and Bruce Baines and Claudia Edwards of
         CORE arrived in Danville to participate in the demonstrations.
         Civil rights lawyers affiliated with the National Lawyer's
         Guild and the NAACP, including William M. Kunstler, Dean Robb,
         Nathan Conyers, and Samuel W. Tuckers, also arrived in
         Danville to help represent the demonstrators. On June 10,
         after a full day of protests, the police, with nightsticks and
         fire hoses, attacked the demonstrators picketing the city
         jail. Forty-seven of the fifty demonstrators required medical
         attention.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations continued, however, and by mid-July over
         250 people had been arrested on charges of contempt,
         trespassing, disorderly conduct, assault, parading without a
         permit, and resisting arrest. Parents were arrested when they
         went to the jail to post bail for their children for
         contributing to the delinquency of a minor by not providing
         adequate supervision.</p>
      <p>The defense lawyers, including Len W. Holt, Ruth L. Harvey,
         Jerry Williams, and Harry I. Wood, in addition to those from
         the National Lawyer's Guild and the NAACP, attempted to remove
         the cases from the corporation court to federal court, but to
         no avail. Each defendant demanded an individual trial causing
         the corporation court's dockets to be filled to such an extent
         that cases separate from the demonstrations could not be
         heard. The prosecutor requested a change of venue to alleviate
         the crowded docket and Aiken transferred about 124 cases to
         other courts throughout Virginia.</p>
      <p>The defense lawyers again sought an order from the federal
         courts to stay all arrests, trials, and other proceedings for
         violation of the injunction and city ordinance. On August 8,
         the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals halted these trails
         pending the outcome of the appeals. Judge Aiken, however,
         continued hearing the cases for disorderly conduct, parading
         without a permit, resisting arrest, and trespassing. He
         generally sentenced the guilty parties to two to five days in
         jail and a fine, suspending execution of the sentences pending
         an appeal. In September, defense counsel agreed to consolidate
         the cases and Aiken rescinded his orders for change of
         venue.</p>
      <p>By mid-August, the demonstrations had largely waned due to
         Danville's unwillingness to yield to the protests. A year
         later, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal dissolved the
         injunction, but, by a 3-2 margin and with a strong dissent,
         declared Aiken's injunction constitutional. Moreover, the
         cases were remanded to the corporation court where the
         Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals could hear the necessary
         appeals. The United States Supreme Court upheld the decision
         by a five-four margin.</p>
      <p>In December 1966, Judge Aiken resumed the trials of those
         who violated his injunction. The trials proceeded quickly.
         Aiken did not find all the defendants guilty and dismissed
         some cases for lack of evidence. The usual sentence was eight
         days in jail and a fine of twenty dollars. The demonstration
         leaders received the stiffest penalties with Rev. Lawrence G.
         Campbell receiving the worst, being sentenced 250 days in jail
         and a $2,500 fine.</p>
      <p>In early 1967, the Virginia Supreme Court began deciding
         the first of the appeals from the Danville Corporation Court.
         In Thomas v. City of Danville, the Court ruled Judge Aiken's
         injunction constitutional. In York v. City of Danville, they
         ruled that a parade can be subject to "reasonable and
         nondiscriminatory regulation," but that the city's time
         requirement for applying for a permit was too harsh. In 1970,
         the Court ruled in Rollins v. Commonwealth that the state must
         prove that a defendant not named in the injunction had
         knowledge of the injunction before violating its orders. In
         January 1973, the Supreme Court of Appeals heard the last of
         the cases associated with the demonstrations and requested
         that the Commonwealth's Attorney for Danville review the cases
         under appeal in light of the court's previous rulings. As a
         result, the Court overturned the convictions of almost 270
         people. However, the Court upheld the convictions of those
         named in the injunction and for trespassing, obstructing
         traffic, and illegal picketing.</p>
      <p>On February 9, 1973, the court proceedings involving the
         Danville demonstrations of 1963 came to end. Judge Glynn R.
         Phillips, Jr. of Clintwood was assigned to hear the defense
         motion to suspend the jail sentences and fines of those whose
         convictions had been upheld. Judge Aiken had died in 1971 and
         the new Danville Corporation Court judge had disqualified
         himself. Against the prosecutor's objections, Judge Phillips
         suspended the jail sentences on condition of good behavior for
         two years, but ordered payment of fines that totaled more than
         $5,000.</p>

               from June 1963-February 1973. Judge Aiken, from June
               1963-May 1967, ordered the arrest of demonstrators for
               violating his injunction and inciting the colored
               populace, the appearance of demonstrators before the
               court to answer these violations, the investigation of
               the juvenile defendants, the serving of jail time and
               payment of fines, the acquittals of defendants, the
               consolidation of cases, and the changes of venue. The
               court orders issued January-February 1973 involved the
               disqualifying and recusing of the Danville Corporation
               Judge Stuart L. Craig, the selection of Judge Phillips
               to replace Craig, the subpoenaing of defense witnesses,
               and the suspension of jail sentences for the remaining
               defendants. Also, includes judgements issued by Judge
               Ted Dalton of the United States District Court for the
               Western District of Virginia in May 1967.</p>

               appeal by the Supreme Court of Appeals. These dictabelts
               also included inserts containing written summaries of
               their audio contents and in most cases copies of the

               Dictaphone Corporation to record and transfer the audio
               contents and the inserts of these dictabelts onto
               compact disc. Below is an inventory of the
