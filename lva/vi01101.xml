         <head>Biographical Information</head>
         <p>Francis Walker Gilmer was born 9 October 1790 at "Pen Park"
         in Albemarle County, Virginia, to George Gilmer (1742-1795)
         and Lucy Walker Gilmer (1751-1800). He received some of his
         education at Monticello from Martha Jefferson Randolph
         (1772-1836) and at a school run by James Ogilvie (1760-1820).
         Gilmer attended the College of William and Mary in 1809-1810,
         then studied law under William Wirt (1772-1834) in Richmond,
         Virginia. Upon the completion of his legal studies, he
         travelled extensively along the eastern seaboard with the Abbe
         Joseph Francisco Correa de Serra (1750-1823) before beginning
         the practice of law in Winchester, Virginia, in 1816. A year
         later, Gilmer returned to Richmond to continue practicing law.
         In 1824, he was chosen by Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) to
         travel to Europe to hire professors for the newly established
         University of Virginia. Gilmer himself was appointed professor
         of law, but he died before he could assume his position on 25
         February 1826 at "Farmington" in Albemarle County.</p>

         <p>Letters, 1818-1824, from Francis Walker Gilmer (1790-1826)
         of Richmond, Virginia, to Dabney Carr (1773-1837) of
         Winchester, Virginia, discussing state and national politics;
         Gilmer's personal life and legal career; and news of friends
         and acquaintances. Gilmer discusses his legal career in
         Richmond; Carr's career as chancellor and his appointment to
         the Court of Appeals; and William Wirt's (1772-1834) career as
         United States Attorney General. He also discusses the
         processes of selecting judges for the chancery courts and the
         Court of Appeals. Gilmer offers information regarding his trip
         to Europe to hire professors for the new University of
         Virginia. Gilmer comments on his, Carr's, and Wirt's health,
         and on Peachy R. Gilmer, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe,
         William Pinkney, John Randolph, Martha Randolph, Spencer
         Roane, Creed Taylor, Henry St. George Tucker, and Robert Wirt,
         among others. He remarks on his failed courtships of Ellen
         Wayles Randolph (Coolidge) (1796-1876) and Elizabeth Tucker
         Coalter (Bryan) (1805-1856). Gilmer writes about his travels
         to the Virginia springs and to Albemarle County, Virginia.</p>
