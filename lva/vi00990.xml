<head>Processing Information
</head>

<p>The Virginia Penitentiary collection came to the Library of Virginia in multiple accessions over several decades.  In many cases, the original order of the material had been disturbed or was unidentifiable.  In other instances, the provenance was unclear and an educated guess was made as to which person or office created the records.  Care was taken to maintain the original order when possible, but for the most part, the arrangement of this collection is artificial.  The series names and groupings were devised by the processing archivist in an attempt to create logical divisions within this large collection.  Cross-references can be found in many series descriptions that will point the researcher to similar material in other series.
</p>

<p>Additionally, separate box and volume numbering systems were imposed by the processing archivist for finding aid and stack location identification purposes.  The box and volume numbers should be used when requesting material, but are not always in strict numerical order.

<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>In December 1796 the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation authorizing the construction of a penitentiary and providing details on its design and operation.  Governor James Wood (1796-1799) selected Benjamin Henry Latrobe as architect and Thomas Callis as superintendent of the project.  A twelve acre plot of land on the James River just outside of Richmond was purchased and construction began in 1797.
</p>

<p>The Virginia Penitentiary opened in 1800.  Latrobe's design, while architecturally impressive, was functionally flawed.  The cells were large enough to hold several prisoners.  However, the cell doors had no windows making it impossible to supervise the prisoners.  In addition, the cells had no heat, poor ventilation and no plumbing.  Prisoners also had to eat in these conditions since the penitentiary did not have a dining room.  The penitentiary's day-to-day operation was overseen by a Keeper (or Superintendent), appointed by the Governor for a one year term, and deputies appointed by the Keeper.  A board of twelve inspectors, appointed by the Hustings Court of the City of Richmond, oversaw  penitentiary operations.  In 1819 the General Assembly abolished the Board of Inspectors and created a five person Board of Directors  (later reduced to three members) who were appointed by the governor; the Keeper was still appointed by the governor.  An 1852 act gave the General Assembly the power to elect a superintendent for a two year term.  The 1902 Constitution expanded the Board of Directors to five members and empowered the Board, not the General Assembly, to select the Superintendent for a four year term..  In 1942 the Virginia General Assembly created the Virginia Department of Corrections, consolidating the administration and regulation of all penal and correctional intuitions under one agency lead by the Commissioner of Corrections.  This new department was overseen by a five member Board of Corrections.  Corrections departments were merged into the Department of Welfare and Institutions by a government reorganization act passed by the General Assembly in 1948.  In 1974 the Department of Welfare and Institutions was abolished and a new Department of Corrections was created.
</p>

<p>Two of the most influential superintendents were Evan F. Morgan (1906-1909) and Rice M. Youell (1922-1942).  In 1906 Morgan established the State Convict Road Force to assist the new State Highway Commission build roads in Virginia.  Beginning in 1908, all executions were centralized at the Virginia Penitentiary.  Morgan oversaw the installation of the electric chair and established procedures for executions.  Youell was the longest serving of any superintendent at the Virginia Penitentiary.  He served as superintendent from 1922 to 1942.  During this tenure he greatly expanded educational and vocational opportunities for inmates.  He successfully transitioned the Penitentiary's industries to meet the requirements of the federal Hawes-Cooper Convict Labor Act of 1929.  This legislation prohibited the interstate sale of prison goods and went into effect in 1934.  The General Assembly passed legislation in 1934 which established the state-use principle regarding prison products created by convict labor.  The law specified that prison industries should only produce items needed by state agencies or political subdivisions.  Youell was selected as the first Commissioner of Corrections in 1942.  In 1948 he was named director of the reorganized corrections division, a position he held until his retirement in 1960.  Major Youell was elected president of the American Prison Association in 1937 and president of the Southern States Prison Association in 1955.
</p>

<p>Latrobe's original structure was torn down in 1928.  The Virginia Penitentiary closed in December 1990 and was torn down in 1992.

<scopecontent><p>The Penitentiary Papers series is housed in nine (9) boxes with oversized material separated out and is arranged into seven (7) subseries.  Subseries have been designated for:  A. Penitentiary Construction Papers; B. Letters of Application and Recommendation for Position of Penitentiary Keeper, Agent and Physician; C. Board of Inspectors and Visitors; D. Prisoners; E. Prison Conditions and Investigations; and F. Penitentiary Financial Records.  This series consists of accounts, affidavits, contracts, deeds, letters (correspondence), minutes, muster rolls, petitions, plats, proceedings, reports and vouchers.  This is an artificial series consisting of extant pre-1865 Penitentiary related records.  During the evacuation of Richmond in April 1865, Penitentiary Superintendent Colin Bass carried off most of the penitentiary records and very few pre-1865 penitentiary records survive.  Many of the records in this series were removed at some point from other collections such as the Office of the Governor and Auditor of Public Accounts.  Additional records from the antebellum era related to the penitentiary may be found in the records of the Auditor of Public Accounts, General Assembly (especially Legislative Petitions and Executive Communications) and Office of the Governor. Published annual reports of the Directors of the Penitentiary as well as legislative reports on the Penitentiary from the antebellum period can be found in the Journal of the House of Delegates [J87 v6].</p></scopecontent>

<scopecontent><p>This subseries is housed in 11 folders and contains correspondence and records related to the construction of the Virginia Penitentiary.  <emph render="bold">Benjamin Henry Latrobe</emph> was named architect and <emph render="bold">Thomas Callis</emph> as superintendent of the project.  Included is a survey of 12 acres in Henrico County and Richmond City for a penitentiary site (30 March 1797) and a petition of eight Richmond inhabitants against the proposed location of the penitentiary (1797).  Thomas Callis also writes to Governor James Wood accepting appointment as superintendent of the project (16 April 1797).  Callis enters into a contract with Martin Mims to supply 600,000 bricks for the penitentiary (21 July 1797).  Benjamin Latrobe's correspondence with Governor Wood and the Council of State include offering his services for the penitentiary (25 January 1797) and acknowledgment of receipt of payment for his services (12 May 1797, 20 July 1797).  Latrobe periodically reports on topics including general progress report (6 July 1797), water supply and well shaft (13 July 1797, 19 October 1797 and 26 October 1797), brick work (15 July 1797, 19 July 1797 and 22 August 1797), state of the walls, arches, brick work and delivery of materials (17 August 1797) and an estimate for the tunnel to carry water to the penitentiary and the number of bricks needed to complete the building (29 September 1797).  Latrobe also asks the Governor for permission to temporarily retain the book of drawings for the penitentiary in order to copy them (5 October 1797).  Additional Latrobe and Callis correspondence highlight their dispute over John Shortis' bill for work on the penitentiary and their supervisory responsibilities.  Latrobe provides his account of the Shortis' conflict in letters to the Council of State (31 August 1797) and John Courtney (9 September 1797).  Latrobe also writes Callis and informs him of his plans to inform the Council of Callis' incapacity as Superintendent (26 August 1797) and Callis' reply (27 August 1797).</p></scopecontent>

<p>The Prisoner Records series is housed in 379 boxes and contains 128 volumes and 16 reels of microfilm.  The series has been divided into five (5) subseries.  Subseries have been designated for:  A. Registers; B. Inmate Photographs; C. Penitentiary Commitment Orders; D. Inmate Index Cards; and E. Execution Files. Contains a variety of records pertaining to prisoners at the Virginia Penitentiary, such as prisoner registers, medical records, punishment records, prisoner photographs and negatives, commitment orders, prisoner index cards and execution files. These records provide personal information about prisoners and documentation of their incarceration.  Researchers should first check this series, specifically the Prisoner Registers and Indexes, for basic information on prisoners (name, prisoner, number, age, race, crime, sentence, date of admission, date of discharge, escape, clemency, assignment outside Penitentiary).  This information is crucial to access other parts of the collection.  For example, the prisoner number is needed to locate records in Subseries B.  Photographs and Negatives; the State Convict Road Force camp number (noted on the register) is needed to access many of the records in Series V. State Convict Road Force, especially the registers, rosters and discharge lists. </p>

Reels 5989-6004.</emph>  The Prisoner Registers only include felons ("stripemen"); "jailmen" convicted of misdemeanors and sentenced to a State Convict Road Camp are not included in these records.  Researchers should consult Series V. State Convict Road Force for any extant "jailmen" records.

<p>There are five volumes of unnumbered Prisoner Registers for prisoners admitted between 3 January 1924 and 20 February 1945.  While these volumes overlap with the numbered registers, they also fill in the gaps within the collection.  Unlike the numbered registers, these do not include information on the age and birthplace of prisoner.  The reason and purpose for these duplicate registers is unknown.  The unnumbered volumes are not indexed.  However, researchers should use the extant index volumes described in Subseries A.I.1. Prisoner Registers and Indexes to obtain the prisoner number to check these volumes.
</p>

<p>The <emph render="underline">first unnumbered Prisoner Register</emph>
 includes prisoners admitted from 3 January 1924 to 7 August 1930 (inmate number 19253 to 25834).  The register includes name of prisoner, sentence, date received, date discharged, crime, where sentenced, race and assignment (penitentiary, state farm, road camp, etc.).  <emph render="bold">[Misc.

<p>The <emph render="underline">fourth unnumbered Prisoner Register</emph>

<p>There are 6 volumes of <emph render="bold">Punishment Registers and Indexes</emph> from 1896 to 1931 and 1940 to 1946.  An 1896 Act of the Virginia General Assembly required the Superintendent to keep a separate punishment register.  These volumes list the types of infractions and punishment administered to prisoners for violating prison rules.  Types of offense include:  not working/poor work, insubordination, use of foul language, sodomy/homosexual activity, fighting, attacking other prisoners and/or guards, possession of weapons and stealing.  <emph render="bold">These records are privacy protected and are closed for 75 years from the date the record was created.</emph>
</p>

<p>The <emph render="underline">Record of Punishment</emph>
 from 1896 to 1905 is arranged by date and is further divided within each year by area of prison where offense occurred (Finishing Room, Ward, Farm, etc.)  The register includes date, name of prisoner, inmate number, offense, punishment, name of person reporting offense and name of person administering punishment.  A separate volume indexes this record.
</p>

<p>The <emph render="underline">Punishment Register</emph>
 covering 1 October 1905 to 8 January 1931 is arranged by date of punishment and includes name of prisoner, inmate number, offense, date of offense, punishment, name of person ordering punishment, name of person administering punishment and signature of officer present.  This volume includes the Penitentiary, State Farm, State Lime Plant and Convict Road Crew.
</p>

<p>There are two <emph render="underline">Punishment Registers</emph>
 covering 1907 to 1917.  Each is arranged by inmate number and includes name of prisoner, date of offense, type of offense and number of stripes.  The 1940-1946 register is arranged by date and includes:  location (penitentiary, state farm, or road camp), inmate number, name of prisoner, number of stripes, signature of officer administering punishment, signature of officer reporting punishment, detailed description of offense and description of medical condition before and after administration of punishment.

<p>There are 13 volumes and three folders of <emph render="bold">Registers and Records of Prisoners Pardoned or Paroled, Discharged, Died or Escaped</emph> from 1892 to 1971.  There are two volumes of Monthly Report of the Penitentiary (February 1892 to November 1912; and November 1912 to November 1924).  Each volume lists the number of prisoners in the penitentiary (white men, colored men, white women and colored women), number on public works, the number discharged, pardoned, died and escaped, occupation of prisoners and number of contract laborers.  This volume does not list prisoners by name.  The two volumes of Daily Record of Prisoners list the number of prisoner in the Penitentiary and on the State Farm between November 1902 and January 1911 and February 1911 to July 1936).  This volume does not list prisoners by name.  The Register of Prisoners sent to State Farm, 1897-1918, lists the name of prisoner, inmate number and whether they died or were paroled.  There are four unnumbered volumes (October 1902 to September 1921; October 1921 to July 1929; July 1937 to November 1953; and December 1953 to April 1971) of Registers of Prisoners Pardoned or Paroled, Discharged, Died or Escaped.  These records are arranged chronologically and include the name of prisoner, race, inmate number and note whether the inmate was pardoned or paroled, discharged, died or escaped.  The volume also notes subsequent action taken with regards to the inmate and location of the inmate if taken back into the prison system.  A Day Book (January 1933 to December 1940), arranged by month, lists each prisoner's name and number who is scheduled to be released that month.  The Death Register, 1926 to 1951, is arranged by fiscal year (July to June) and includes the following information:  name of prisoner, inmate number, race, age, time of death, date of death, cause of death, time in prison and where the inmate died.  Also include at the back of this volume is a list of children born in the penitentiary for fiscal years 1926-1927, 1928-1929, 1930-1931 and 1931-1932.  The list includes the name of child, date of birth, place of birth, race, sex, name of mother, inmate number and admission date to penitentiary of mother.  There are two additional volumes of Daily Record of Prisoners (1 April 1906 to 11 September 1926 and 6 July 1940 to 26 November 1941) that differ from the early volumes.  Each of these volumes lists the name and number of prisoner and disposition (pardoned, discharged, transferred to road camp, etc.). None of these volumes are indexed.  There are three folders of Monthly Discharge and Parole Lists from 1953 to 1961.  These records are arranged chronologically and lists the name and number of prisoner, race, date of release and location (prison, state farm, road camp, etc.).  There are two folders of Pardon Applications (1901, 1903, 1905-1908 and 1911) arranged alphabetically and containing prisoner record, pardon application and supporting letters and petitions.  There are two folders of Parole Applications (1913-1914) arranged alphabetically and containing prisoner record, application for parole and supporting documents offering parolee employment.

<p>There are two folders of parole application.  Files are arranged alphabetically and consist of prisoner record, application for parole and supporting documents offering parolee employment.  An 1898 Act of the General Assembly (amended several times) granted the Virginia Penitentiary Board of Directors power to parole prisoners if they met certain conditions.  To be eligible the inmate must have served half his term, have not broken any prison rules for the two years preceding the date of one-half his term and the prisoner must have assurance of employment upon his discharge.  The Virginia Attorney General issued an opinion in 1915 stating that any legislation limiting the power of the governor to grant clemency was unconstitutional.

<p>This subseries is housed in 334 boxes and contains 1 volume.  The Photographs subseries is further divided into: B.I. Inmate Photographs, 1906-1914, 1934-1940 and 1965-1966; B.II. Photographs of Escaped Inmates, 1908, 1910, 1912-1935'; and B.III. Inmate Negatives, 1906-1914, 1934-1961.  Additional photographs of inmates may be located within the Execution Files subseries and the Superintendent's Correspondence series.  The photographs and negatives are arranged by inmate number.  The Prisoner Registers and Indexes can serve as an index to this collection.  Please note that not all prisoner photographs and negatives are extant.  The Virginia Penitentiary began photographing new and existing inmates around 1906.  There is a twenty year gap in the collection (1914 to 1934).  This series contains approximately 50,000 inmate negatives; however, at this time, there are photographs for only approximately 12,000 inmates.

<p>There are 5 boxes of <emph render="bold">Photographs of Escaped Inmates</emph> from 1908, 1910, and 1912 to 1935.  These photographs are arranged by inmate number and in most cases there are multiple copies.  Most of these inmates were admitted to the Virginia Penitentiary between 1912 and 1933 and many of these photographs are not included within the Inmate Photographs subseries.  The front of each 3.5" x 5.5" card contains the prisoners mug shot.  The back of the card lists the name of prisoner, inmate number, date and location of escape (Penitentiary, State Farm, or State Convict Road Force camp), date received at Penitentiary, name of county, crime, term, age, height, weight, hair, eye and skin color, names and addresses of relatives and reward amount.

<p>This group of original acetate negatives (39150-39459) had slight deterioration but duplicate negatives and interpositives were created by Northeast Document Conservation Center between 2005 and 2007.  The negatives are housed in 14 boxes.  This group also includes 100 nitrate negatives (12100-12199).

<p>The final and largest group of original acetate negatives (safety film) is stable but no duplicate negatives or prints have been made.  The negatives are housed in 118 boxes and range from inmate number 42900-79449, 79648, 79701, and 80960-80968.  Researchers should note that beginning in the early 1950s negatives for female inmates are not included.

<p>This subseries is housed in 16 boxes and is arranged alphabetically by prisoner name.  These records consist of commitment papers for the years 1865-1896.  Not all commitment papers for this time period are extant.  This subseries only represents a small fraction of the total number of prisoners committed and released from the penitentiary during this time period.  The commitment papers include the name and race of prisoner, court, locality, date of indictment and trial (including the names of the grand jury and jury), crime, date of conviction and sentence.  Some documents include notations by penitentiary staff that list date received at penitentiary, prisoner register book and page numbers and date discharged.  A small number include pardon documents issued by the Governor.  One record of note is a commitment order dated 4 September 1865 for Samuel Van Winkle, Co. G, 5th Pennsylvania Cavalry, who was court-martialed and sentenced to six months in the penitentiary for desertion.

<p>This subseries is housed in six (6) boxes and is arranged alphabetically by prisoner name.  These records consist of index cards containing prisoner information for the years 1914, 1919 and 1921 to 1949.  Not all index cards for this time period are extant.  This subseries only represents a small fraction of the total number of prisoners committed to the penitentiary during this time period.  Each index card includes the prisoner name, prisoner number, alias, race, fingerprint classification, crime, term, date and place received, date term expires, jail time, criminal history, measurements (hat, shoe, collar, coat, and pants), previous address, names and addresses of immediate family (spouse, parents and siblings) and person to notify in case of an emergency.

<p>This sseries is housed in thirteen boxes and is arranged numerically by file number.  In 1908 the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation stating that all executions would occur at the Penitentiary by means of electrocution.  Between October 1908 and March 1962, Virginia executed 236 people.  In 1972 the United States Supreme Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional on grounds that the death penalty was administered too arbitrarily (Furman v. Georgia).  The same court in 1976 ruled that Georgia's new law for capital cases removed the administration issues raised in the Furman decision.  Virginia resumed executions in 1982.   These records document Virginia's executions between 1908 and 1962.  These records include correspondence, court orders and records, lists of witnesses, newspaper clippings, photographs and negatives, prisoner records (including personal data), respites and telegrams.  Also included is one box of records (b384) containing files for prisoners not executed (stay of execution, sentenced reversed on appeal).  Photographs for the first 60 prisoners executed are located in Series II. Prisoner Records, Subseries B.  Photographs and Negatives (b19). Additional execution files from the 1980s and 1990s can be found in Series IV.  Office of the Superintendent, Subseries B.  Correspondence, Raymond Muncy (b479 and b480).

<p>The Board of Directors series is housed in six (6) boxes and contains 15 volumes and is arranged into three (3) subseries.  Subseries have been designated for:  A. Minutes; B. Correspondence and Reports; and C. Annual Reports.  The Virginia Board of Directors controlled and governed the Virginia Penitentiary, State Farm and other branch prisons.  The five directors (three prior to the 1902 Constitution) were appointed by the Governor.  In 1942 the Virginia General Assembly created the Virginia Department of Corrections, consolidating the administration and regulation of all penal and correctional intuitions under one agency lead by the Commissioner of Corrections.  This new department was overseen by a five member Board of Corrections.  Corrections departments were merged into the Department of Welfare and Institutions by a government reorganization act passed by the General Assembly in 1948.  In 1974 the Department of Welfare and Institutions was abolished and a new Department of Corrections was created.  This series documents the activities of the Virginia State Prison Board.

<p>This subseries contains 15 volumes and is arranged chronologically.  These records contain the minutes of the Board of Directors of the Virginia Penitentiary (renamed State Prison Board in 1926) from 1874 to 1877 and 1881 to 1942.  Information in these records includes:  committee reports, correspondence, resolutions, awarding of contracts, approval of bills and financial information, facility improvements (including Penitentiary, State Farm and State Convict Road Force), escapes and decisions on conditional pardons (recommended and rejected).  The minutes give insight into the decision-making process and governance of the Virginia Penitentiary and State Convict Road Force.  The volumes are handwritten through August 1931 and are typed from September 1931 to June 1942.  The volumes are not indexed except where noted.  The subseries also includes one volume, Board Approval of Checks, 1906-1913.

<p>This subseries is housed in two (2) boxes and is arranged chronologically.  This subseries contains  copies of the Board's <title render="italic">Annual Report</title>.  The reports were compiled by the Board of Directors for the Office of the Governor and include reports by the Superintendent (Penitentiary and State Farm), Surgeon (Penitentiary and State Farm) and State Convict Road Force depending upon time period.  The reports include financial information as well as prisoner-related information and statistics.  Tables accompanying the reports often provide additional information on prisoners in the Penitentiary or related bodies (State Farm, State Convict Road Force, etc.), including number of prisoners, socio-economic background of prisoners, list of escaped prisoners, pardons and deaths, births in Penitentiary, and names of children in Penitentiary.  Financial statements detail the costs of operating the Penitentiary, State Farm and State Convict Road Force.  Other topics include recommendations for capital improvements, overcrowded conditions, hiring out convict labor to private companies and convict labor within the walls of the Penitentiary.  This is not a comprehensive collection of Annual Reports.  Researchers will need to check the Library's card catalog for those that are missing.  The pre-Civil War reports can be found as documents within the Journal of the House of Delegates or Executive Communications of the Speaker of the House of Delegates (see accession 36912).  Annual Reports for the Penitentiary (1860s forward) were separate publications (call number HV8366.A31).

<p>The Office of the Superintendent series contains 19 volumes and is housed in 183 boxes and one over-size folder.  It  is arranged into eight (8) subseries.  Subseries have been designated for:  A. Letter Books; B. General Correspondence; C. State Convict Road Force; D. Correspondence-Office of the Governor; E. Reports and Publications; F. Guard Logs-Virginia Penitentiary; G. Reference Books;  and H. Photographs.  These records include letter books, correspondence, subject files, telegrams, contracts, reports, speeches, photographs, audio tapes, videotapes, lists and budgets.  The Superintendent was the chief executive officer of the Penitentiary and directed its internal policy and management subject to the control of the Board of Directors (post 1902 Virginia Constitution).  Prior to the 1901-1902 Constitutional Convention, the Superintendent was elected by the Virginia General Assembly to serve a two year term.  In 1942 the Virginia General Assembly created the Virginia Department of Corrections, consolidating the administration and regulation of all penal and correctional intuitions under one agency lead by the Commissioner of Corrections.  This new department was overseen by a five member Board of Corrections.  Corrections departments were merged into the Department of Welfare and Institutions by a government reorganization act passed by the General Assembly in 1948.  In 1974 the Department of Welfare and Institutions was abolished and a new Department of Corrections was created.

<p>
This series documents the work of the Superintendent's Office at the Virginia Penitentiary.  Researchers should be aware that there are significant gaps within this series.  For example there are very few correspondence prior to 1908, between 1911 and 1913, 1920s, and post World War II.

</p>

<p>Rice M. Youell was born in Rockbridge County on 12 February 1891.  He attended the Virginia Military Institute and was captain of the football team.  Following his graduation from VMI in 1914, Youell enlisted in the United States Army.  During World War I, Youell served in First Division, 26th United States Infantry.  He was wounded in action during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive and received the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism under fire.  Major Youell resigned his commission in 1920 and returned to Virginia to engage in private business.  Youell was elected Superintendent on 15 May 1922 to fill the unexpired term of James B. Wood.  Youell served as Superintendent until 1942 when he was selected as the first Commissioner of Corrections.  In 1948 he was named director of the reorganized corrections division, a position he held until his retirement in 1960.  Major Youell was elected president of the American Prison Association in 1937 and president of the Southern States Prison Association in 1955.  Youell married Gladys Katherine Keller and the couple had one son, Rice M. Youell, Jr.  Youell died on 15 March 1962.

<scopecontent><p>Warden Raymond M. Muncy's records are housed in six boxes and are further divided into Execution Files, Photographs and Videotapes, and Reports and Correspondence.  The Execution Files are restricted for 50 years from date of execution.  There are execution files for Richard Lee Whitley (executed 6 July 1987), Earl Clanton, Jr. (executed 14 April 1988), Alton Wayne (executed 30 August 1989), Richard Thomas Boggs (executed 19 July 1990), Wilbert Lee Evans (executed 17 October 1990) and Buddy Earl Justus (executed 13 December 1990) (b479).  Each execution file contains a photograph taken prior to execution, list of visitors, list of witnesses to execution and an autopsy report.  In addition, there are audio cassette narrations for the executions of Whitley, Wayne, Boggs and Evans (b480).  On these recordings, an unidentified Dept. of Corrections employee provides an eye-witness narration of the execution.  It is unknown why these recordings were made.  Other notable records include:  photographs of aftermath of 9 January 1983 riot at Virginia State Penitentiary (b481, f1); photographs of Penitentiary and Death House, 1991 (b481, f2); videotape of closing of Virginia State Penitentiary ceremony, 14 December 1990 (b481, f3); Research Report "Special Housing Unit Officer Study:  Death Row and Death Watch Officers", 1989 (b481, f8); and copies of "Penitentiary Employees' News, 1989-1990 (b481, f9).

This subseries contains correspondence from the Office of the Governor, written by the Secretary to the Governor (Alexander Forward, W.W. Martin, V.E. McDougall and Laura H. Allen), to the Office of the Superintendent requesting prisoner records in order to evaluate clemency requests.  These records only document the request for individual prisoner records; they do not include a copy of prisoner records.  Researchers should consult the Office of the Governor records and the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Executive Papers for clemency files and supporting documentation.

<p>The State Convict Road Force series contains 50 volumes and is housed in 87 boxes.  It  is arranged into four (4) subseries.  Subseries have been designated for:  A. Prisoner Records; B. Diaries; C. Correspondence; and D. Financial Records.  These records include diaries, correspondence, subject files, registers, rosters, index cards, reports, lists and financial records, This series documents the activities of the State Convict Road Force. 
</p>

<p>The State Convict Road Force was created by the General Assembly in 1906 as part of the Withers-Lassiter "good roads" law that created the State Highway Commission.  The Penitentiary was responsible for creating, administrating and supplying mobile convict road camps for use by the Highway Commission  The camps were manned by felons from the Penitentiary and by misdeamants from local jails.  The number and location of camps changed based upon the needs of the State Highway Commission. The Penitentiary Superintendent and/or Assistant Penitentiary Superintendent was head of the State Convict Road Force.  He was assisted by a chief clerk.
</p>

<p>Researchers should be aware that there are significant gaps within this series.  For example there are very few correspondence prior to 1926 or prisoner registers after 1925.  Topics include convict labor, State Convict Road Force operations (camp supplies, payrolls, camp inventories, rations for prisoners and camp bills), prisoner escapes, and punishment reports.  Prisoners in this series are sometimes referred to as "jailmen" or "stripemen".  Jailmen are prisoners convicted of a misdemeanor and sentenced to a short term (a year or less) on the State Convict Road Force.  Stripemen are convicted felons sentenced to the road force.  Unlike stripemen, jailmen are not included in the Prisoner Registers or Photographs found in Series II. Prisoner Records.  Researchers should also note that additional State Convict Road Force records can be found in Series IV. Office of the Superintendent, Subseries C. State Convict Road Force.

<p>This subseries is housed in 8 boxes and is arranged chronologically and by camp therein.  The camp sergeant wrote daily in the diary.  Topics covered include information about weather, absence of guards, list of convicts and jailmen received, distance men working from camp, visitors, employment/discharge of guards, escapes, movement of camp.  However, most entries contain very little information beyond weather, visitors and location.

<p>The State Convict Lime Grinding Board series is housed in 27 boxes (including five volumes), one oversize folder and contains one volume.  It is arranged into four (4) subseries.  Subseries have been designated for:  A. Minutes; B. Correspondence; C. Financial Records; and D. Records from the Dept. of Agriculture and Commerce.  These records include correspondence, minutes, orders, reports, photographs, vouchers, invoices, bills of lading, payrolls and financial records.  This series documents the activities of the State Convict Lime Grinding Board.
</p>

<p>The State Convict Lime Grinding Board, comprised of the Governor, Superintendent and Commissioner of Agriculture,  was created by the General Assembly in 1912.  The Board was empowered to build facilities to grind limestone and to use convict labor.  The Board was abolished by the state government reorganization act passed by the General Assembly in 1927 and its duties were transferred to the Board of Agriculture and Immigration.
</p>

<p>
Additional information on the creation of the State Convict Lime Grinding Board may be found in the records of Governor William Hodges Mann (1910-1914), Governor Henry Carter Stuart (1914-1918) and Governor Westmoreland Davis (1918-1922).

<p>This subseries contains one box (one folder and one volume) and is arranged chronologically.  These records contain the minutes of the State Convict Lime Grinding Board from 1914 to 1921 and 1923.  The board consisted of three members:  Governor (chairman), Commissioner of Agriculture and Penitentiary Superintendent.  The Board was created by the General Assembly in 1914 and supervised the employment of state penitentiary convicts at State Lime Grinding Plant No. 1 (Staunton) and State Lime Grinding Plant No. 2. (Irvington).  The 1927 state government reorganization act abolished the Board and transferred its duties to the Board of Agriculture and Immigration (later renamed Dept. of Agriculture and Commerce.  Information in these records includes:  correspondence, awarding of contracts, approval of bills and financial information, construction of plants, installation of machinery, and facility improvements.  The minutes give insight into the decision-making process and governance of the Stat Convict Lime Grinding Board.  The minutes are typed and are not indexed.

The original order and grouping of these volumes is unclear, but an attempt was made by the processing archivist to keep similar records together based upon the headings of each volume and/or its' contents.  In many instances, there are significant gaps in type of record and date.  The records in this series document various aspects of the financial history of the Virginia State Penitentiary.  Researchers should note that the annual reports of the Penitentiary contain financial statements (see Series III.  Board of Directors, Subseries C:  Annual Reports).  Financial information on the State Convict Road Force can be found in Series V. SCRF, Subseries D:  Financial Records.

<p>Notable financial records include:  the check book for the purchase of the electric chair, 1908 (volume 220), inmate accounts which tracked the money earned and spent by prisoners (volumes 235-237), and pay roll material for Penitentiary guards and staff, 1903-1919 (volumes 218, 219 and 266) and 1945-1947 (volume 267).
