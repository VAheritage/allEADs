<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Henry Alexander Wise was born 3 December 1806 in Accomack County, Virginia, to Major John Wise (d. 1812) and Sallie Cropper Wise (d. 1813). Wise attended Washington College in Pennsylvania, graduating in 1825. He then studied law under Henry St. George Tucker in Winchester, Virginia. Admitted to the Virginia bar in 1828, Wise followed his future wife and family to Nashville, Tennessee. He practiced law in Nashville for two years before returning to Accomack in 1830. Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1833, Wise served until 1844. He was nominated as United States Minister to Brazil on 18 January 1844. He was officially appointed by President John Tyler, 16 February 1844, as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States to Brazil. Wise was recalled and succeeded by David Tod in August 1847. He represented the Eastern Shore counties of Accomack and Northampton in the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850-1851, and represented Princess Anne County in the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861. Wise was elected governor of Virginia in 1855 and served from 1856 to 1860, during which time he met with John Brown (1800-1859) after the latter's failed raid in Harper's Ferry, (West) Virginia. During the Civil War, Wise raised troops and was appointed a brigadier general. After the war, he practiced law in Richmond, Virginia. Wise married three times: first, to Ann Elizabeth Jennings (1808-1837) of Nashville, Tennessee, 8 October 1828; second, to Sarah Sergeant (d. 1850) of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, November 1840; and third, to Mary Elizabeth Lyons (1817-1901) of Richmond, Virginia, 1 November 1853. He fathered fourteen children, only seven of whom reached maturity. Wise died 12 September 1876, and was buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. </p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Papers, 1829-1847, of Henry A. Wise, consisting of drafts of Wise's letters to Brazilian officials, letters and documents received by Wise, and informational notes and papers relevant to United States and Brazil relations. Correspondents include James Buchanan, John C. Calhoun, John Tyler, and Abel P. Upshur. During Wise's tenure issues relating to slavery, the annexation of Texas, claims of American citizens, tariffs, and the Mexican-American War strained the friendly relationship between the countries. Wise's overzealous and indignant responses to the Brazilian government jeopardized the relationship with Brazil and culminated in Wise's recall in 1847.</p>

<p>This series includes letters, 1844-1847, received by Wise from various state officials including James Buchanan, John C. Calhoun, President John Tyler, and Abel P. Upshur. Included are circulars, 16 February 1844, announcing the appointment of Wise; 1 April 1844, announcing the appointment of John C. Calhoun as Secretary of State; and 10 March 1845 announcing the appointment of James Buchanan as Secretary of State. Included is a lengthy letter, 18 July 1844, from John C. Calhoun regarding the claim of Joseph Ray against the Brazilian government. Of note is a letter, 12 August 1844, from John C. Calhoun analyzing the annexation of Texas, African slave trade, and the relationships with France and England. The letter to Wise emphasizes the importance of Brazil and impresses on Wise the need to appease Brazil that the annexation of Texas was not to be interpreted as a threat to Mexico. Also included is a letter, 10 April 1847, from President James K. Polk to Dom Pedro II regarding the recall of Wise and a letter, 12 June 1847, from James Buchanan to Wise also in regards to his return to the United States.

<scopecontent>
<p>This series includes letters, 1829-1845, lists of citizens claims against Brazil, and notes concerning the historical relationship between the United States and Brazil. Most of the letters pre-date Wise's appointment as Envoy Extraordinary but were perhaps given to Wise for informational purposes. Correspondents include Mariano Roque Alonzo, Marquis de Aracaty, James Buchanan, John C. Calhoun, Pedro Jose Cardoro, Amory Edwards, William Hunter, Carlos Antonio Lopez, Joseph Ray, William Tudor, and John Tyler. Included are several letters between William Hunter, United States representative to Brazil, and Joseph Ray, detailing a claim by Ray for property confiscated by the government of Brazil. Of note are letters, 1843-1845, requesting acknowledgment by the United States for the country of Paraguay and a letter, 10 September 1844, from James Buchanan to Edward Hopkins appointing Hopkins Special Agent to Paraguay and detailing the desired relationship between the two countries. Also of note is a letter, 10 September 1844, from John Calhoun to Wilson Shannon, Minister to Mexico, regarding the annexation of Texas and the possibility war between the countries.
</p>



<p>Also included is a list and history of specific claims of United States citizens against the government of Brazil, 1826-1842, mostly relating to the confiscation of cargo and personal property. A brief history of the relations of the United States and Brazil is also included, containing extractions of letters from William Hunter. Included is a note concerning the detention of two men by Brazilian Customhouse Officers and a history of the colonial expansion policy of France towards South America.</p>
