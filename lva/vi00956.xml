         <p>The Convention of 1861 met from 13 February 1861 until 27
         June 1861 and from 14 November 1861 until 6 December1861. The
         firing on Fort Sumter, on 12 April, ignited the confederates
         to action. On 17 April 1861, the Virginia Convention voted
         eighty-eight to fifty-five to secede from the United States of
         America. The Ordinance of Secession, which repealed the
         ratification of the United States Constitution, was ratified
         on 23 May. Three days later, the Convention created an
         advisory Council to assist the Governor in preparation of the
         state's defenses. Governor Letcher named Francis Henney Smith,
         John James Allen, Matthew Fontaine Maury, Thomas Sherwood
         Haymond and Robert Latane Montague to the Council. They
         recommended that Letcher appoint Robert E. Lee to command the
         state's forces. Lee accepted the appointment, taking over
         command on 23 April 1861. On 14 November 1861, the convention
         met again to draft a new state constitution and adjourned on 6
         December 1861. The new constitution was submitted to the
         voters for approval, but it was defeated.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The Virginia Constitutional Convention records are
         organized into three series. Series have been designated for
         Election records, Convention records and Ordinance of
         Secession records.</p>
         <p>Series #1: Election Records, 1861 This series is divided
         into three sub-series:</p>
         <p>Subseries A: Election of Delegates, 4 February 1861. This
         subseries consists of election certificates from the special
         election held to elect delegates to the convention of 1861.
         The election was held 4 February 1861. Also included are
         election abstracts from the special election held on the same
         day on the referendum question: shall the convention's action
         be ratified by popular vote? These records are filed together
         and are arranged alphabetically by locality. Records are not
         extant for all localities.</p>
         <p>Subseries B: Special Election of Delegates, 24 October 1861
         (to fill vacancies). This election was held in order to fill
         vacancies in the Secession Convention caused by the expulsion
         of certain delegates from the western counties. These
         delegates were expelled 28-29 June, but when the convention
         recessed 1 July, no provision had been made to fill their
         vacancies. On 11 October Governor John L. Letcher issued a
         proclamation providing for elections in those counties then in
         the possession of the enemy, but he did not take any
         cognizance of the vacant convention seats nor did he order any
         specific election to be held. On 24 October a special election
         was held to fill the vacant seats of those delegates who had
         been expelled from the convention. This date is ascertained
         from the manuscript election abstracts. Because the western
         counties were not under the control of the Richmond
         government, the election could only be held in those military
         encampments in eastern Virginia in which soldiers from the
         western counties were stationed. There is also one poll book
         of civilian refugees who had come to Richmond. On 19 November
         the convention, now re-convened, ratified the election of the
         new convention delegates. The Convention Journal states that
         the election had been provided for by the Governor's
         proclamation of 11 October. The manuscript election abstracts
         themselves cite this proclamation as the authority for the
         election. However, the text of the proclamation does not call
         for a specific election. [above subseries description written
         by T. Headlee, c. July 1964]</p>
         <p>Subseries C: Referendum Election Returns, 23 May 1861. This
         subseries consists of abstracts and/or poll books from the
         referendum on the ordinance of secession and the taxation
         amendment to the Virginia constitution. The referendum was
         held 23 May 1861. The records are arranged by locality and by
         military encampment. Also included are election statements on
         the finally tally of votes for both referendum questions.
         Returns are not extant for all localities.</p>
         <p>Series #2: Convention Records, 1861 This series is divided
         into two subseries:</p>
         <p>Subseries A: Ordinances, 1861. This subseries consists of
         ordinances, arranged numerically, passed by the Convention in
         its three sessions. Ordinances 1-48 were passed during the
         May-June 1861 session; 50-88 were passed in June-July 1861;
         and 89-99 were passed in November-December 1861. Not all
         ordinances are extant, including numbers 89-99. Also included
         are ordinances, arranged chronologically, that were tabled or
         rejected by the convention. All of the ordinances were
         published in volume II of Journals and Papers of the Virginia
         State Convention of 1861. Also included is an oversize volume
         of convention ordinances, resolutions and schedules.</p>
         <p>Subseries B: Miscellaneous Records, 1861. This subseries
         consists of reports, arranged chronologically, submitted to
         the Convention. Many of these reports were published in volume
         III of Journals and Papers of the Virginia State Convention of
         1861. Also included are resolutions, petitions and memorials,
         correspondence and documents, the convention's pay list volume
         and the proceedings of the Committee on Federal Regulations
         (16 February 1861 to 30 March 1861). The Committee proceedings
         are available only on microfilm (Miscellaneous Reel 571). The
         original is part of the Brock Collection, Huntington Library,
         California.</p>
         <p>Series #3: Ordinance of Secession, 1861-1961 This series
         contains the original Ordinance of Secession along with
         correspondence and affidavits documenting ownership after its
         removal from Richmond during the Civil War until its return to
         the Library in 1930. The correspondence and affidavits, dated
         1887 and 1929, certify that the Ordinance of Secession was
         among various papers found in the "State House" in Richmond by
         Charles W. Bullis, a member of the 20th New York Stat Militia,
         known also as the 80th Regiment of New York Volunteers. Mr.
         Bullis sold the document, 10 October 1887, to Major George
         Hooker Treadwell who, in turn, gave it to his son, George
         Curtis Treadwell. Also included are several photo static
         copies of various facsimiles of the Ordinance owned by the
         National Archives and the Virginia Historical Society as well
         as correspondence and research notes by Library of Virginia
         staff concerning the history and ownership of these various
         editions of the Ordinance.</p>
