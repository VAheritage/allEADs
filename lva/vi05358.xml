      <head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Warwick County (extinct) was named for Robert Rich, earl of Warwick, a prominent member of the London Company, or for the county of Warwick in England. The county was originally called Warwick River and was one of the original shires, or counties, first enumerated in 1634. The name was shortened to Warwick in 1643. Warwick County became extinct in 1952, when it became the city of Warwick. The new city was consolidated with the city of Newport News in 1958 and took the latter's name.   
</p>
<p>Newport News probably commemorated Christopher Newport, who made five voyages to Virginia between 1607 and 1619. The Old Dominion Land Company bought land there in 1880 and began laying out a new village in October. Newport News was incorporated as a city by Act of the General Assembly in 1896 without ever having been incorporated as a town. On 1 July 1958 Newport News was enlarged by oonsolidating with the City of Warwick, which then became extinct. In the years before consolidation, Newport News annexed land from Warwick County in 1917, 1921 and 1940; from Elizabeth City County in 1927 and 1937; and from both Elizabeth City County and Warwick counties in 1921.   
</p>
<p>Warwick County court records were destroyed several times, with most destruction occuring during the Civil War. The clerk's office was burned on 15 December 1864. County court minute books and loose records from 1787 to 1819 were destroyed by this fire. Additiona records were burned on 3 April 1865, in Richmond, where the county records had been moved for safekeeping during the Civil War.
