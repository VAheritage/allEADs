      <p>John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg was born 1 October 1746 in
         Trappe, Pennsylvania. He attended the Academy of Philadelphia
         (University of Pennsylvania), and studied at the University of
         Halle in Germany from 1763 to 1766. He returned to
         Philadelphia, studied theology, and was ordained in 1768.
         Muhlenberg served Lutheran churches in New Jersey before
         moving to Woodstock, Virginia. He was ordained in the Anglican
         Church in 1772. Muhlenberg served in the Virginia House of
         Burgesses in 1774. When the American Revolution began, he
         raised and commanded the 8th Virginia (German) Regiment. He
         was commissioned a brigadier general in the Continental Army
         in 1777 and brevetted a major general in 1783. After the
         Revolution, he settled in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.
         Muhlenberg was elected to the Supreme Executive Council of
         Pennsylvania in 1784 and served as its vice president from
         1785 to 1788. He was elected to the United States Congress
         three times, serving from 1789 to 1791, from 1793 to 1795, and
         from 1799 to 1801. Elected to serve in the U.S. Senate in
         1801, he resigned his seat 30 June. President Thomas Jefferson
         appointed Muhlenberg supervisor of revenue in Pennsylvania in
         1801 and collector of the port of Philadelphia in 1802. He
         married Anna Barbara Meyer (1751-1806) in Philadelphia 6
         November 1770, and they had six children. Muhlenburg died 1
         October 1807 in Philadelphia, and was buried in the Augustus
         Lutheran Church Cemetery in Trappe.</p>
