      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories. 
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Culpeper County may have been named for Catherine Culpeper; for her mother, Margaret Lady Culpeper; or for Thomas Culpeper, second baron Culpeper of Thoresway, governor of Virginia from 1677 to 1683; or for their family, which long held proprietary rights in the Northern Neck. It was formed from Orange County in 1749. The county seat is Culpeper. 
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Lost Locality Note:</emph> A significant number of loose records are missing for the period prior to 1840. They were stolen, mutilated, and/or destroyed during the Civil War. Culpeper was the site of several military engagements and experienced widespread pillaging by both Union and Confederate troops. The county courthouse was used as a jail for Confederate prisoners by Union forces.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Culpeper (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1803-1927, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.
</p>
      <p>Several suits involve fertilizer companies, such as the Bradley Fertilizer Co., the Patapsco Guano Co., the Southern Fertilizer Co., the Tygert Allen Fertilizer Co. and the Tygert Fertilizer Co., the Virginia Carolina Chemical Co., the Monumental Chemical Co., and the Zell Guano Co., many of which ended after 1890. The Culpeper National Bank and the Culpeper Savings Bank were directly associated with seven and eight suits, respectively.
</p>
<p>Commonly found surnames among the plaintiffs and defendants include Alcocke, Ashby, Baker, Barbour, Beckham, Bell, Bickers, Bowen, Bowers, Brooke, Brown, Browning, Butler, Clatterbuck, Colvin, Compton, Coons, Corbin, Covington, Curtis, Dulaney, Eggborn (also spelled Eggborne), Fant, Farish, Field, Flint, Freeman, Gaines, Gibson, Gordon, Gray, Grayson, Green, Hall, Hansbrough (also spelled Hansborough), Hill, Hitt, Hudson, Hume, Jackson, Jameson (also spelled Jamison), Jeffries, Jennings, Johnson, Jones, Kelly (also spelled Kelley), Latham, Lewis, Lightfoot, Long, Major, Marshall, Miller, Moore, Nalle, Nelson, Obannon, Payne, Pendleton, Perry, Petty, Richards, Rixey, Roberts, Robertson, Ross, Rosson, Scott, Settle, Shackleford (also spelled Shakelford), Slaughter, Smith, Somerville, Stringfellow, Strother, Taylor, Thomas, Thompson, Triplett, Turner, Vaughan (also spelled Vaughn), Ward, Wharton, Wheatley, Williams, Willis, Wood, Yancey, and Young.</p>
