      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Accomack County was named for the Accomac Indians, who lived on the eastern Shore at the time of the first English settlement in Virginia. One of the original eight shires established in 1634, Accomac County (spelled without a k) became Northampton County in 1643. The present country was formed from Northampton about 1663. In 1940 the General Assembly adopted the county's present spelling.
</p>
      <p>In 1780 the Virginia General Assembly replaced the Anglican vestries and churchwardens of the colonial period with elected bodies called Overseers of the Poor. The Overseers provided food, clothing, shelter, and medical treatment for the persons who were too poor to support themselves or too ill to provide for their basic needs. They also bound out children whose parents could not support them or who failed to educate or instruct them, as well as orphans to become apprentices. The boys learned a trade and the girls learned domestic skills.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The Accomack County (Va.) Apprentices' Indentures are two volumes dated 1835-1859 and 1850-1872. The Board of Overseers of the Poor made the indentures between an adult who would teach the apprentice a trade and a child that was either orphaned or its parents were not teaching them the skills they needed to support themselves when they became adults. These volumes are form books that have the indentures printed on the pages.  The Overseers entered the information into the forms. The indentures gave the name of the child being bound out, to whom they were being bound, and the age at which they were to be released from the indenture.  The indenture list the trade for which the child was being trained.  Some of the apprentices were taught reading,  writing, and common arithmetic as far as the rule of three. The apprentices were to receive food, drink, washing, and wearing apparel. From 1835 to 1853 the apprentices were given a sum of money when they arrived at age agreed upon to end their indentures.  In 1853, the parents of the apprentices or the apprentices received payments annually for their services.
</p>
      <p>Stuck in Accomack County (Va.) Apprentices' Indentures, 1850-1872 is an undated Registration Oath for William G. Riley, Judge of the Circuit Court.  This volume includes actual indentures and a receipt from an apprentice who recieved a sum of money when he came of age.</p>
