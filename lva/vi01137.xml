<p>Robert "King" Carter (1663-1732) was one of the largest land holders in Virginia and one of its most prominent leaders. King Carter lived at Coromoton in Lancaster County, Virginia. He and his first wife Judith
Armistead Carter (1665-1699) had five children. King Carter and his second wife Betty Landon Willis Carter (1683/4-1719) had ten children. Charles Carter of Cleve (1707-1764), in King George County, Virginia, was
the fifth child of King Carter and Betty Carter. His son was Charles Carter of Ludow (1732-1796). Charles Carter of Shirley (1732-1806), in Charles City County, Virginia, was the son of John Carter (1689-1742),
first son of King Carter and Judith Carter. Carter of Shirley married Mary Walker Carter (ca. 1736-1770), daughter of Charles Carter of Cleve. Robert Carter of Nomini (1728-1804), in Richmond County, Virginia, was
the son of Robert Carter (1704-1732), the oldest son of King Carter and his second wife Betty. St. Leger Landon Carter (1785-1850) was the son of Landon Carter of Cleve (1751-1811), son of Charles Carter of Cleve.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Papers, 1718-1833, of the Carter family of Lancaster and King George Counties, Virginia, consisting of accounts, bills of lading, epitaphs, invoices, letters, and wills. Accounts and invoices are for bedding,
dry-goods, wigs, clothing, and a telescope purchased by members of the Carter family, also includes account of tobacco sold by Robert Carter, and accounts for medical services rendered by Dr. John Tennant and a
Dr. Hall. Bills of lading record tobacco shipments from King George County to England by Charles Carter (1707-1764). Correspondence topics include business and agricultural matters such as tobacco, seeds, sheep,
and copper supplies; political subjects such as the appointment of Robert Dinwiddie (1692-1770) as Governor of Virginia, Great Britain's colonial policy, the Stamp Act, the Revolution, and early United States
politics; and social and family news, including Robert Carter (1663-1732) being informed his sons have arrived safely in England, the relationship between Robert Carter and his son Charles, and Robert W. Carter's
concerns over his son George's gambling problems. Two letters discuss Carter family genealogy and there is also a copy of tombstone inscriptions from Christ Church in Lancaster County. Papers also include the
will, 23 July 1730, of Robert "King" Carter and a roster, 29 April 1756, of the King George County militia.
