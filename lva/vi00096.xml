      <p>On March 17, 1856, the General Assembly adopted a law
         entitled, "An act providing additional protection for the
         slave property of the citizens of this Commonwealth." This
         legislation established a new inspection system to prevent the
         escape of both slaves and criminals aboard commercial shipping
         vessels. All vessels outward bound for any northern port were
         subject to the inspection. The act, however, did not apply to
         vessels owned by the United States government, citizens of
         Virginia, or citizens of foreign countries.</p>
      <p>Dr. Jesse J. Simkins was appointed as the first Chief
         Inspector and Edward S. Gayle and James L. Adams were
         appointed as river inspectors and assigned to the Rappahannock
         and Potomac rivers, respectively. Ultimately, twelve men
         served as inspectors until 1861. The pilots, however, acted as
         the primary investigators and two pilot boats were regularly
         assigned to intercept daily shipping and issue certificates to
         those vessels cleared for passage. Vessel inspections ceased
         in 1861, soon after Virginia seceded from the Union.</p>
      <p>Only one incident resulted in a prosecuted case of
         assisting a slave to escape. On May 28, 1858, an inspector
         discovered a fugitive slave aboard the schooner Francis
         French. Free black crew member William H. Thompson confessed
         his involvement as the lone perpetrator and he received the
         maximum sentence of ten years in the penitentiary.</p>
      <p>Chief Inspectors included Dr. Jesse J. Simkins (March 1856
         - May 1858) and William H. Parker (May 1858 - 1861).</p>
      <p>River Inspectors included Edward S. Gayle (March 1856 -
         June 1856); James L. Adams (April 1856 - August 1859); John F.
         D. Robinson (June 1856 - July 1857); Capt. Robert B. Fitchett
         (July 1857 - September 1858); John M. Ford (June 1858 -
         Januanry 1860); John Day Gressitt (September 1858 - 1861);
         George G. Wise (June 1859 - September 1860); Devereux B.
         Traverse (August 1859 - 1861); John S. Braxton (September 1859
         - January 1860); and James Fossett (Feb. 1861).</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of detailed quarterly reports by
         the Chief Inspector of Vessels to Governors Henry Wise and
         John Letcher from October 1856 to March 1861. These reports
         typically include the vessel's name, homeport, previous port
         of call, destination, cargo, vessel owner, captain and number
         of crew. These reports provide a unique register of more than
         thirteen thousand vessels plying the waterways of the
         Commonwealth. Quarterly reports for the periods April to
         September 1856 and October to December 1857 did not
         survive.</p>
