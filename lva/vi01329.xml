<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Mechanics Building Fund Association, based in Lexington, Virginia, was incorporated on November 15, 1867, in accordance with an act to provide for the incorparation of "Building Fund Associations" passed by the Virginia General Assembly on May 29, 1852, and amended by an act passed on January 31, 1867. The purpose of such associations was to accumulate a fund to enable its members to purchase houses and lots, erect buildings, improve lands, and to remove incumbrances from real estate. It would also distribute among its members their proper dividends from revenue accumulated by the fund.
</p>
<p>The journal, 1867-1876, of the Mechanics Building Fund Association was probably used as an exhibit in court cases that involved the association heard in Rockbridge County Circuit Court.
