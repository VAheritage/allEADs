<p>The 1747 report consists of a statement by Deputy Auditor John Blair concerning the settlement of rights with the secretary of the colony, and is one of the most significant documents extant on 
the operations of the Colonial Land Office. Blair referred to the annual destruction of the supplemental papers relating to patents which had been issued, the rights remaining in the office, records that may have been lost in the recent burning of the Capitol. The document was found by the register in 1816 as a loose page in one of the patent books.
</p>
<p>Other reports were prepared by the committees examining the register's office in 1785, 1787, 1788 1791, 1801, 1812, 1842, and 1855. These reports examined the records of the land office to determine that they were in good order and condition. The 1785 report noted that any delay resulted from the fact that Western surveys were only brought to the office every 3 or 4 months, in large quantities. The 1801 report commented specifically on the number of clerks in the office and the duties of each; it also references the surveying expedition of Major William Price. The records also include reports prepared by the register in 1802 and 1810. The 1802 report, prepared in response to a resolution from the Senate requesting information, contains the amounts of land issued in the last year, an account of fees received by the office, and the number of clerks employed as well as their salaries. The 1810 report provides information on the fees received by the office, the number of books containing records of grants, the state of the original plats and certificates for Northern Neck, and the number of surveys on which grants had not been issued. The 1810 report is located in an oversize box.
</p>
<p>The 1917 report was prepared by John W. Richardson, Register of the Land Office, for the Commission on Economy and Efficiency that was created by act of the General Assembly in March 1916. The records include correspondence between Richardson and the secretary of the commission, Le Roy Hodges, related to the preparation of the Land Office report. They also include questionnaires sent as a guide in preparing the report, drafts of certain answers, a rough copy of the report, a list of employees under Richardson's supervision, and copies of related acts.
