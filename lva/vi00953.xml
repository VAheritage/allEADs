      <p>The Office of Administration was established in 1966 as
         part of the Office of the Governor to assist the chief
         executive in carrying out his duties. Several agencies
         including the divisions of the Budget, Personnel, Engineering
         and Building and Planning reported to the Commissioner of
         Administration. This system was inadequate. In 1970, the
         Governor's Management Commission Study recommended the
         creation of six "Deputy Governors" to assist the Chief
         Executive in his managerial duties. Compatible functions of
         government were grouped under these administrative heads, who
         would serve as the Governors top management team or
         "secretariats," as they are called now.</p>
      <p>Governor Linwood Holton's top priority for the 1972 session
         of the General Assembly was a proposal for a Governor's
         Cabinet, reorganizing state agencies into six major
         departments--each headed by a secretary appointed by the
         governor. The Office of Administration was made one of these
         six departments. The office of Secretary of Administration was
         created on April 8, 1972, by an act passed by the General
         Assembly. Governor Holton appointed T. Edward Temple, the
         Commissioner of Administration since 1970, as the first
         Secretary of Administration. When Temple took office on July
         1, 1972, he was responsible for the divisions of the Budget,
         Personnel, Engineering and Buildings, Automated Data
         Processing, Justice and Crime Prevention, State Planning and
         Community Affairs, Council on the Environment, State Board of
         Elections and the Office of Special Programs. The Office has
         undergone a series of administrative reorganizations since
         1972. On April 12, 1976, the Legislature combined the
         secretariats for administration and finance, effective July 1,
         1976. On July 1, 1984, the offices were separated. The
         Secretary of Administration is a member of the Governor's
         Cabinet, and is appointed by the governor, subject to
         confirmation by the General Assembly. Currently the Secretary
         of Administration is responsible for the direction or
         jurisdiction over the following state agencies and boards:
         Charitable Gambling Commission, Compensation Board, Department
         of Employee Relations Counselors, Department of General
         Services, Department of Human Resource Management, Council on
         Human Rights, Commission on Local Government, Department of
         Rights for Virginians with Disabilities, and the Department of
         Veteran's Affairs.</p>
      <p>In January 1998 Governor-elect James S. Gilmore III named
         G. Bryan Slater as Secretary of Administration. Slater also
         served as Gilmore's Deputy Chief of Staff. He worked on
         Gilmore's campaign for attorney general in 1993 and served as
         his director of administration when Gilmore was Virginia
         Attorney General (1994-1997). Slater resigned in March 2001 to
         work for the Republican National Committee which Gilmore
         chaired. He was replaced by his deputy, Donald L. Moseley who
         served until the end of the Gilmore administration in January
         2002.</p>
