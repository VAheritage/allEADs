         <head>Biographical Information</head>
         <p>John Rolfe was born in England in 1585. He emigrated to
         Virginia aboard the "Sea Venture," which was wrecked in
         Bermuda, before completing its journey. Upon his arrival in
         Virginia, Rolfe began experimenting with various tobaccoes
         until developing one which became economically viable. For
         doing this, Rolfe has been credited with saving the colony of
         Virginia by providing it with a cash crop. He was appointed
         secretary in the colonial government in 1614 and recorder
         general in 1617. Rolfe served on the council from 1619 to
         1622. Rolfe's first wife, Sarah Hacker Rolfe, travelled with
         him to Virginia and there or in Bermuda. Their only daughter
         died in Bermuda. Rolfe married Pocahontas (d. 1617) in April
         1614 and they had one son. At some date after 1617, he married
         Jane Pierce and they had one daughter. Tradition claims that
         Rolfe was killed in the Powhatan attack of 22 March 1622, but
         his name was not on the list submitted by the colony of those
         settlers who died. Rolfe had been in poor health and may have
         died of natural causes at roughly the same time.</p>
