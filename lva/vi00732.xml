         <p>The son of Robert Carter Nicholas (1728-1780) and Anne Cary
         Nicholas (1735-1786), Wilson Cary Nicholas was born in
         Williamsburg, Virginia, 31 January 1761. He attended the
         College of William and Mary, and commanded George Washington's
         Life Guard until it disbanded in 1783. Nicholas married
         Margaret Smith (1765-1849) of the prominent Smith family of
         Baltimore, Maryland. He served as a member of the Virginia
         House of Delegates from 1784 to 1789 and in the Virginia
         convention to ratify the Federal Constitution. He returned to
         the House of Delegates from 1794 to 1800, at which time he was
         elected to finish the Senate term of Henry Tazewell
         (1753-1799), who had died. Nicholas served in the United
         States Senate until 1804, when he resigned to become collector
         of the port of Norfolk, Virginia, a position he held from 1804
         to 1807. Elected to the United States House of
         Representatives, Nicholas served from 1807 to 1809. He later
         served as governor of Virginia from 11 December 1814 to 11
         December 1816. Nicholas died at Tufton in Albemarle County,
         Virginia, 10 October 1820, and was buried at Monticello, home
         of his friend, Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826).</p>
