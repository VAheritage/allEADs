      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
      <p>Halifax County was named for George Montagu Dunk, second earl of Halifax, who was president of the Board of Trade from 1748 to 1761. It was formed from Lunenburg County in 1752. Halifax County regained the city of South Boston on 1 July 1995, when the latter relinquished its city status. The county seat is Halifax.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Halifax County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1753-1913, are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
      <p>Chancery cases are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.

          <p>Trustee of slaves emancipated by the will of Philip E. Vass in 1832 sued to receive the ex-slaves share of the estate given to them by Vass in his will. The funds were to be used to pay for their removal to another state or to Liberia. The slaves had successfully won their freedom in 1841 in a chancery suit filed in Halifax County (See Halifax County Chancery Cause 1841-010 Jacob, etc. vs. Exr. of Phillip E. Vass). The emancipated slaves were denied entry into North Carolina. Some of the emancipated slaves died and others had married and had children since they won their freedom. The suit alludes to some slaves wanting to remain in Virginia. If they did, could they receive their portion of Vass' estate.

</unittitle>
        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>Suit involved settling the accounts of a slave trading partnership consisting of Eliza M. Shelton, Francis L. Royall, and William Royall. Eliza Shelton's deceased husband Abner C. Shelton was a partner with the Royall brothers in the slave trade prior to his death. Exhibits include correspondence related to slave trade activities. William Royall was a resident of Hamburg, S.C., the end point for a route used by slave traders that began in Alexandria, VA and included Fredericksburg, Richmond, and Colombia, SC. From Hamburg, slave traders crossed the Savannah River to sell slaves in Georgia. Hamburg was located across the Savannah River from Augusta, GA. This route was less travelled by slave traders as slave markets in Mississippi and Louisiana became more valuable in the 1820's and 1830's. The opening of the new slave markets probably prompted William Royall's decision to move from Hamburg to Richmond, VA as the new slave partnership's base of operations. Quote from a letter dated 1836 May 28 written by Francis Royall to his brother William: "I perceive from your letter that you are doing something in the way of speculation in negroes. You will find I fear that you have 'swapped the Devil for the Witch' in leaving Hamburg for Richmond." Hamburg being the "Devil" and Richmond being the "Witch." The partnership purchased slaves in Virginia and sold them in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Letter dated 1834 Jan 10 from Francis Royall to Abner C. Shelton: "William Royall has left Mississippi and returned to Lancaster with his family. He is now at J.B. Royall's house and intends to trade negroes from here to Mississippi and Louisiana. I suppose you have seen from the newspapers that Louisiana has repealed the laws prohibiting the introduction of slaves. That will be a fine market to trade in and I wish you to trade there with an increased capital as negroes are 30 or 40 per cent higher than they are in Georgia." References in letters to using Northern banks to finance partnership. One letter dated 3 April 1834 to a cholera outbreak in Louisiana and Mississippi "destroying a great number of negroes belonging to the (slave) traders. Several traders from this country have lost money this season and some to a large amount. Negroes are falling every day rapidly."
