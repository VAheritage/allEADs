      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>On February 21, 1818, the Virginia legislature passed a school bill which appropriated $45,000 annually from the Literary Fund for the education of poor children. (The Literary Fund had been established in 1810 with passage of a bill to appropriate "certain escheats, confiscated, and forfeited lands" for the "encouragement of learning.") Under the provisions of the 1818 School Act, each county court was required to appoint five to fifteen commissioners to establish and/or administer schools for children of the poor. A more comprehensive public school system was established by the legislature in 1870. Prior to 1818, county courts were given the option of whether to appoint a Board of School Commissioners.
</p>
      <p>The Virginia Constitution of 1870 mandated Virginia's first statewide public school system. The schools were racially segregated by law until the mid-twentieth century.</p>
      <p>Giles County was named for William Branch Giles, United States senator from Virginia in 1806 when the county was created. It was formed from Montgomery, Monroe (now in West Virginia), and Tazewell Counties, and parts of Wythe, Monroe, Mercer (now in West Virginia), Craig, and Tazewell Counties were added later.
