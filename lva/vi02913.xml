      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Giles County was named for William Branch Giles, United States senator from Virginia in 1806 when the county was created from Montgomery, Monroe (now in West Virginia), and Tazewell Counties. Several subsequent additions were made from Wythe (1808), Monroe in 1829 and Mercer in 1841 (both now in West Virginia), Craig (1880), and Tazewell (1826 and 1836) counties. The county seat is Pearisburg.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Giles County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1807-1936, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.
</p>
      <p>The chancery causes are primarily comprised of debt suits, the bulk of which ended between 1807 and 1912; divorces, which ended between 1857 and 1912; and estate suits, which ended between 1835 and 1912. The most frequently occurring topics include business, migration/immigration, property, women, and social conventions.
</p>
<p>Commonly found surnames among the plaintiffs and defendants include Adair, Atkins, Bolton (also spelled Bolten), Chapman, Charlton, Davis, Echols, Epling, Farley, French, Hale, Hare, Harman, Henderson, Hoge, Huffman, Johnson, Johnston, Jones, Kirk, Lucas, Martin, Meadows, Mustard, Pack, Payne, Peck, Peters, Porterfield, Price, Shumate, Smith, Snidow, Spangler, Stafford, Straley, Taylor, Toney, Vaught, Wilburn, Williams, Wingo, Woodyard, Woolwine, and Young.Â The Johns Mountain Iron Company was involved in 7 suits between 1874 and 1886.
</p>
<p>These records also contain 1 folder of âOrphan Chanceryâ which has been processed but not indexed. These records contain parts, often single items, of chancery causes that could not be further identified as belonging to a certain case. </p>

          <p>William Wesley, "a man of color," was, prior to and during the American Civil War, enslaved by David J. S. Snidow. He, along with another man named Ballard Viney, entered into an agreement with Snidow in 1873 to purchase 150 acres of land. Following Vineyâs death in 1880, Wesley agreed to settle for 50 acres based on the payments made under the agreement before 1880. According to Wesley, Snidow later attempted to force Wesley to pay an additional $600 for the 50 acres under threat of vacating the agreement. Wesley initiated a chancery suit against Snidow to force performance of their agreement and to prevent his land from being taken away by Snidow.</p>
