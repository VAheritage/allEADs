      <head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
      <p>John R. Cary served as clerk of Gloucester County from 1837 until his death in 1867.
</p>
      <p>The records were used as evidence in a chancery case heard in Gloucester County Circuit Court in 1874 entitled John S. Cooke, Executor of John R. Cary versus Widow of John R. Cary and others. The suit originated from Cary's wish in his will that an inventory on his estate not be performed to determine its value before selling it to pay off his debts. Upon assuming executorship of Cary's estate, Cooke was unable to carry out Cary's wish due to the numerous debts Cary incurred personally and as representative of both Matthew W. Kemp's estate and Thomas Cary's estate. Cooke asked the court to assist him in determining the value of Cary's estate and the debts Cary owed. The court ordered all papers and books kept by Cary related to his estate, and as representative of both Kemp's estate and Thomas Cary's estate, audited by a special commission and a report made.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Records, 1832-1869, maintained by or related to John R. Cary and recording financial, agricultural, and miscellaneous information concerning Cary's estate in Gloucester County.
</p>
      <p>Account book of Thomas Cary's estate, perhaps kept by his nephew John R. Cary, who became representative of his uncle's estate following his death. Portion of volume dated 1832-1840 records accounts of individuals who did business with the Thomas Cary estate and the accounts of the estate itself. Transactions are listed in chronological order. Information found in each account includes date of transaction, style of transaction, form of payment, amounts owed and paid. Transactions include loans, payment of loans, house expenses, payment of laborers, and slave sales and hires. Pages in volume, dated 1868-1869, record transactions perhaps related to a church fundraiser.
</p>
      <p>Two memorandum books of John R. Cary. One dated, 1847-1852, records payments to laborers; purchases of merchandise, groceries, and guano; debts; and sale of wheat. A second memorandum book, dated 1860, records cash paid and cash received by Cary. Transactions are listed in chronological order and include purchases of food, whiskey, nails, guano, and spices, repairs to carriage, spices, and miscellaneous expenses. Cary received cash from payment of debts, sale of slaves, slave hires, and fees from court suits. The last few pages of memorandum book record payments made to laborers who were perhaps doing work on Cary's home. Several pages list dimensions of various rooms, such as the parlor, portico, and porch. The second memorandum book also includes a list of slaves hired out by Cary as personal representative of Matthew W. Kemp and a list of slaves owned by Cary in January 1860.
</p>
      <p>Account book, 1868-1869, kept by John S. Cooke, executor of John R. Cary. The volume records Cooke's transactions both personal and as executor of Cary's estate. Information found in volume includes name of account, date of transaction, cash paid, cash received, and names of individuals paid or from whom cash was received. Accounts, kept by Cooke as Cary's executor, record payment of debts owed by Cary at the time of his death. Volume includes receipts for payment of debts. Cooke's personal accounts record loans made to individuals many of whom were African-American. Repayment of loans were made by labor such as cutting wood, hauling goods, and washing clothes or by hiring themselves or children to Cooke for a period of time.
</p>
      <p>Account book, 1847-1864, of John R. Cary, recording the accounts of individuals and companies Cary had transactions with, both personal and as representative of Matthew W. Kemp's estate. Information found in volume includes name of account, date of transaction, style of transaction, amount paid, amount received, and name of individuals paid or from whom cash or items were received. Transactions relate to Cary's personal debts, maintenance of house and other buildings on his estate, agricultural supplies and debts incurred by Cary as Kemp's representative. Account book also contains detailed information related to the planting of wheat and production of pork by Carey's estate. In addition, there is miscellaneous information related to history of Cary family, and remedies for diseases such as cholera and scrofula. There are also loose papers in volume, one of which is a letter written by Cary during Civil War era in which he recounts a Northern raid on the town of Gloucester.
