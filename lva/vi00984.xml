<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Policy Office is a division of the Office of the Governor in the Executive Branch of Virginia state government. During Governor Tim Kaine's administration, the Policy Office was responsible for planning and implementing the Governor's policy initiatives, including proposed legislation, as well as overseeing the Administration's response to legislation and initiatives proposed by legislators and other interested parties, managing the Governor's Office review of regulations and developing and issuing executive orders and executive directors.  On 11 January 2006, Governor-elect Kaine named Brian Sheppard, then Lt. Governor Kaine's chief of staff, to serve as Policy Director.  The Policy Director was assisted in his responsibilities by a Legislative Director/Deputy Policy Director (William L. Murray, January 2006-May 2007; Suzette Denslow, May 2007-January 2009; and Barbara Reese, January 2009-January 2010), Senior Advisor (Mark E. Rubin) and Policy Staff (Steven Gould, 2006-2007; Felix Safro-Katanka, Jr., 2006-2007; Gena Boyle, January 2006-December 2009; Maribel Ramos, 2006-2007; Joyce Walton; Jennie Moline, 2006-2009; Hayes Framme, 2006-2008; Marc Cheatham; and Megan Root).

<p>The Regulations series is housed in 42 boxes and is arranged by cabinet secretary and alphabetically by state agency therein.  The series consists of regulation review forms, memorandums, recommendations, and summary of regulations.
</p>

<p>This series documents the Kaine Administration's executive branch review of Virginia's Regulatory Process.  Before a regulation become available for public comment on <extref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/">Town Hall, Virginia's regulatory website</extref>, it often undergoes review by the Department of Planning and Budget, the responsible Cabinet Secretary and the Governor (via the Policy Office).  The Office of the Attorney General also may review the regulation.  Each regulation reviewed by the Policy Office usually includes a Regulatory Review Form, memorandum(s) from the Department of Planning and Budget (DPB) and the Town Hall posting.</p>

<p>The Regulatory Review Form for each regulation usually includes:  a summary of the regulation and all amendments, explicit legislative mandate, a fiscal impact statement, summary of the Department of Planning and Budget recommendation, agency and cabinet review, and Policy Office review with recommendation(s).  The form is then initialed for approval or disapproval by a policy analyst (Gena Boyle, William Murray, Suzette Denslow, Jennie Moline, Maribel Ramos, Megan Root, Steven Gould, Marc Cheatham or Barbara Reese), Director of Policy (Brian Shepard), Senior Policy Advisor (Mark E. Rubin, 2006-2009), Counselor to the Governor (Lawrence Roberts, 2006-2009 or Mark E. Rubin, 2009-2010), Chief of Staff (William H. Leighty, 2006-2007 or Wayne Turnage, 2007-2010) and in some instances Governor Kaine.</p>

<p>The memorandums from the Department of Planning and Budget were written to the Governor (through the responsible cabinet secretary) by the head of DPB (Richard D. Brown, 2006-2008 or Daniel S. Timberlake, 2008-2010).  Each memo summarizes the background of each regulation and contains DPB's recommendation.  The Town Hall posting includes Notice of Intended Regulatory Action (NOIRA) and includes public comments.</p>

<p>Regulations are from agencies under the Secretary of Administration, Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry, Secretary of Commerce and Trade, Secretary of Education, Secretary of Finance, Secretary of Health and Human Resources, Secretary of Natural Resources, Secretary of Public Safety, and Secretary of Transportation.  Some regulations for November-December 2009 and January 2010 are filed at the end of this series.  The majority of regulations are from the Commerce and Trade and Health and Human Resources Secretariats.  A few regulations are from the Warner Administration (2002-2006).</p>

Each file usually contains the text of each bill including any amendments, bill tracking information, Governor's Summaries (prepared by the Division of Legislative Services), Legislative Action Summaries (for bills tabled, withdrawn or killed in committee), Governor's Policy Office Enrolled Bill Review Forms, Enrolled Bill Reviews (by Cabinet Secretary), Department of Planning and Budget Fiscal Impact Statements, Attorney General's Recommendations to the Governor (restricted for 75 years - attorney/client privilege) and other miscellaneous legislation-related documents which explain in detail various bills brought before and voted upon by the General Assembly.  In addition to providing the policy positions and decisions of the Kaine administration, the Legislative Files may also be useful to researchers in determining legislative intent.
</p>
<p>Each Governor's Summary prepared by the Division of Legislative Services contains the bill number, patron, bill summary, other information and name of reviewer.  The Enrolled Bill Reviews, prepared by the agency most affected by the legislation, summarize the bill and the number of votes for passage achieved by the House and Senate.  The reviews include affected constituents' summary, agency analysis and recommendations, recommendations by the appropriate cabinet secretary and notations as to whether the Governor should sign, ask to amend or veto the bill.  The Governor's Policy Office Enrolled Bill Review Form contains the vote in the House and Senate, a list and explanation of any no votes, fiscal impact (if any), summary of bill and comments by a Policy Office analyst (Mark Rubin, Maribel Ramos, Felix Sarfo-Kantanka, Jennie Moline, Suzette Denslow, Steven Gould, William L. Murray, Wayne Turnage), and recommendations to Governor Warner from the Analyst, Director of Policy (Brian Sheppard), Counselor (Lawrence Roberts, 2006-2009 and Mark Rubin, 2009-2010) and Chief of Staff (William H. Leighty, 2006-2007 and Wayne Turnage, 2007-2010) if the Governor should sign, veto or amend the bill.  Some files contain Department of Planning and Budget fiscal impact statements which detail the monetary affect any legislation might have on the budget.  The Office of the Attorney General's Recommendations to the Governor contain check boxes noting if the legislation conflicts with existing law or the Virginia and Federal constitutions, as well as any suggested amendments or comments. The Attorney General's Recommendations are restricted due to attorney-client privilege.  Other files also contain correspondence including e-mail messages from bill supporters and opponents related to that particular bill.  Also included in this series are Legislative Action Summaries that contain agency and cabinet secretary recommendations and handwritten comments and Governor's suggested amendments and veto messages.

<p>The Executive Directives and Executive Orders series is housed in two boxes and is arranged numerically by directive or order number.  This series contains the original, signed executive orders. The <extref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://bit.ly/3zbqrqU"><emph render="bold">Executive Orders Digital Collection</emph></extref> includes 110 executive orders and 9 executive directives issued by Governor Kaine. However, many of the 2006 executive orders in this series also include an Executive Order Approval Form.  This form documents the need for the executive order, summary of major provisions and recommendations by cabinet secretary, policy office analyst, Policy Director, Counselor and Chief of Staff.  Unlike Executive Orders, Executive Directives do not have the force of law.  Governor Kaine issued nine Executive Directives and 110 Executive Orders during his administration.  The series consists of executive directives, executive orders and executive order approval forms.

<p>The Policy Analyst Files series is housed in 28 boxes and is arranged into six (6) subseries.  Subseries have been designated for:  A. William L. Murray, Deputy Policy Director and Legislative Director; B. Suzette Denslow, Deputy Policy Director and Legislative Director; C. Barbara Reese, Deputy Policy Director; D. Gena Boyle, Special Assistant to the Governor for Policy; E. Steven Gould, Senior Special Assistant to the Governor for Policy; F. Reference Material.  The Analyst Files filed kept their records by subject and/or by analyst.  In some instances the files of one analyst are interfiled within the records of another.  This is noted in the subseries description.  The series consists of correspondence, memorandum, legislative files, background information, reports, briefing books, presentations, e-mail, talking points, agendas and subject files.  This series documents the activities of individual policy analysts and the development of policy during the Kaine Administration.  Several policy analysts also worked for Governor Mark R. Warner (2002-2006) and their files included records from his administration.  Researchers are advised to read the description for each subseries.
