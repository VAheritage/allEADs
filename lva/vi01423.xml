<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Greensville County was formed in 1780 from Brunswick County. An additional part of Brunswick County was added in 1787 and part of Sussex County was added in 1802. The county is named either for Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene or for Sir Richard Grenville, leader of the Roanoke Island settlement of 1585.
</p>
<p>Prior to 1853, when the Commonwealth began recording vital statistics, Virginia marriages were recorded at the county or city level. Beginning in 1661, in order to be married by license, the groom was required to go before the county clerk and give bond with security that there was no lawful reason to prevent the marriage. The license, issued then by the clerk, was given to the minister who performed the service.
Written consent from a parent or guardian was needed for individuals younger than twenty-one years.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Marriage Register, 1781-1853, is essentially divided into two sections. The first section covering pages 1-142, 1781-1853, records the date of the marriage bond, the names of both parties, the names of the parents or guardians present and the names of the security or witnesses in attendance.There is a marriage of note on pages 56 and 160. According to the entries, a free mulatto woman, named Mina or Mima, married David Watkins in December 1805. On page 142, there is an undated marriage bond.
</p>
<p> The second section covering pages 143-183, 1785-1853, records the date of the marriage, the names of both parties, the minister's name and the religious denomination of the minister.  Beginning on page 143, there is additional information given for some entries--in which county the marriage license was taken out. Entries on pages 181-182, 1853, also include such additional information as the age
of the parties, the occupation of the husband, the status of the parties, where the parties were born and where they will live, the names of their parents and where the marriage ceremony took place. Ministers' ordination bonds from 1789 and 1793 are found on page 183.
</p>
<p>An Index to Marriage Register, 1781-1853, is a separate volume. This typescript index contains the first and last names of both parties. It is arranged alphabetically from A-Z and in addition, lists alternate spellings of both first and last names.
