      <p>Marion Johnson Dimmock was born in Portsmouth, Virginia in 1824 and moved to Richmond in 1833. He served in the Confederate Army, attaining the rank of captain. He became one of the most prolific Virginia
architects in the period 1870-1900. Among his more prominant commissions during this period were the Confederate Memorial Chapel (1887), a hotel in Elkton, Virginia (1890), Richmond Chamber of Commerce Building
(1891-1892), Mortuary Chapel in Hollywood Cemetery (1897-1898), and an addition to the State Library Building (Dimmock &amp; Lee, 1908).

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This single sheet depicts a floor plan and elevation for All Saints Episcopal Church, northwest corner of Grace and Madison Streets in Richmond, Virginia. Marion J. Dimmock was a member of the vestry of All
Saints. The unsigned plan shows the striped-down Romanesque Revival structure undertaken by Dimmock ca. 1887. Known within the parish as the Madison Street Church, the structure was used for worship until 1901,
when it was replaced by a new building on Franklin Street. It was then used as a parish house and sunday school building until 1920. The structure was demolished in 1935, when it was deemed unsafe.
