        <head>Acquisition Information

        <p>These items came to the Library of Virginia in transfer of court papers from King George County in 2005 under the accession number 41901.

<processinfo>
<head>Processing Information
</head>
<p>The King George Chancery series was processed and indexed completely before the King George Judgements were examined. Chancery causes were found within the Judgements series and pulled to be added into the King George Chancery Causes series. These pulled records were processed and indexed separately. 
</p>
<p>King George was largely processed by a field processing archivist, but completed by a Library of Virginia archivist in 2007.</p>
<p> Encoded by G. Crawford: 2008; updated by J. Taylor: June 2023.</p>
<p>Backstage Library Services generated digital images from microfilm reels of the collection in 2018 funded by Circuit Court Records Preservation program.

      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph>King George County was named of in honor of King George I. The county was formed from Richmond County by a statute of 23 December 1720. The county court first met on 19 May 1721. The county seat is King George.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Lost Locality Notes:</emph>: Created by an act of 1720 to take effect on May 19, in 1721. Most loose records prior to 1830 are missing. Volumes that record deeds, court orders, and wills exist.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>King George (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1802-1922, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.

These causes are generally selected based upon guiding principles of having historical, genealogical or sensational significance; however, determining what is "of interest" is subjective, and the individual perspective and experience of the describing archivist will affect the material identified.</title></p>

          <p>St. Leger Landon Carter emancipated in his will a number of enslaved people, some of whom had already moved to Philadelphia, PA. He left them considerable amount of money and property, and also made clear the newly freed people could not be sent to Liberia without their consent and while they had to leave the state of Virginia, they could choose where they moved to.
