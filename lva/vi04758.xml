      <head>Historical Information
</head>
     <p><title render="bold">Context of Record type:</title> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories. 
</p>
      <p><title render="bold">Locality History:</title> Stafford County was named for the English county. It was formed from Westmoreland County in 1664. Part of King George County was added in 1777. The county seat is Stafford.
</p>

 <p><title render="bold">Lost Locality Note:</title> Many pre–Civil War court records were lost to vandalism by Union troops during the Civil War. A few volumes that record deeds, court orders, and wills exist.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Stafford County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1866-1912, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.

          <p>Plaintiff is seeking a divorce from defendant. Reuben maintains that Lydia became a "decided, earnest and fanatical enthusiast." According to the plaintiff, Lydia fell prey to one of the "prevalent 'isms' of the times" [probably abolitionism]. The plaintiff provides the names of prominent abolitionists such as Wendell Philips and Parker Pillsbury whom his wife invited to their home. Lydia came to neglect her household duties and her obligations as a wife finally ending in a violent and avowed aversion toward him. Reuben had his wife placed in an "insane asylum" for observation. The couple were married in Connecticut and initially lived in Massachusetts. Defendant filed suit for divorce in Massachusetts citing adultery and cruelty. Lydia then moved to New York where her mother resided. Eventually, plaintiff left Massachusetts for Virginia. Plaintiff works in a gold mine.
