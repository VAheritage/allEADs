      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Warren County was named for Joseph Warren, the revolutionary patriot who sent Paul Revere and William Dawes on their famous rides and who was killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill. The county was formed from Frederick and Shenandoah counties in 1836. 
</p>
      <p>In 1780, the Virginia General Assembly replaced the Anglican vestries and churchwardens of the colonial period with elected bodies called Overseers of the Poor. The Overseers provided food, clothing, shelter, and medical treatment for the persons who were too poor to support themselves or too ill to provide for their basic needs. They also bound out children whose parents could not support them or who failed to educate or instruct them, as well as orphans to become apprentices. The boys learned a trade and the girls learned domestic skills. 
</p>
      <p>In 1844, the General Assembly enacted laws to create poor farms overseen by boards of directors for the maintenance and education of the poor. The boards bought farms and built buildings, appointed a superintendant for each poor farm, and chose a physician to attend the sick and teachers to educate the children. The adults and older children were required to work if they were able.
</p>
      <p>In order to control the population of certain animals in a locale, citizens were allowed to kill them. They took the scalps of the animals to court and the court paid them for the scalps. In Warren County, hawks, owls, wild cats, gray foxes, red foxes, and minks were the animals killed for payment. Scalps Claims are voucher stating the type and number of scalps and the name of the person submitting the voucher.
</p>
      <p>Sheep Claims are records of sheep killed or bitten by dogs. The bodies of the sheep were examined by the court and the owners were reimbursed for the animals killed or injured by a dog.
