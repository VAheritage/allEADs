<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The Office of Administration was established in 1966 as part of the Office of the Governor to assist the Chief Executive in carrying out his duties.  Several agencies including the divisions of the Budget, Personnel, Engineering and Building and Planning reported to the Commissioner of Administration.  In 1970, the Governor's Management Commission Study recommended the creation of six "Deputy Governors" to assist the Chief Executive in his managerial duties. Compatible functions of government were grouped under these administrative heads, who would serve as the Governor's top management team or "secretariats," as they are now called.  Governor Linwood Holton's top priority for the 1972 session of the General Assembly was a proposal for a Governor's Cabinet, reorganizing state agencies into six major departments, each headed by a secretary appointed by the Governor.  The office of the Secretary of Administration was created on April 8, 1972, by an act passed by the General Assembly.  Governor Holton appointed T. Edward Temple, the Commissioner of Administration since 1970, as the first Secretary of Administration.  When Temple took office on July 1, 1972, he was responsible for the divisions of the Budget, Personnel, Engineering and Buildings, Automated Data Processing, Justice and Crime Prevention, State Planning and Community Affairs, Council on the Environment, State Board of Elections and the Office of Special Programs.  The Office has undergone a series of administrative reorganizations since 1972.  On April 12, 1976, the Legislature combined the secretariats for administration and finance, effective July 1, 1976.  On July 1, 1984, the offices were separated.</p>
<p>The Secretary of Administration is a member of the Governor's Cabinet, is appointed by the governor, and is subject to confirmation by the General Assembly.  During Governor Tim Kaine's term , the Secretary of Administration was responsible for the direction of, or had jurisdiction over, 8 state agencies and boards as follows: Compensation Board, Department of Employment Dispute Resolution, Department of General Services, Department of Human Resource Management, Council on Human Rights, Department of Minority Business Enterprises, Public Broadcasting Board, and the State Board of Elections.</p>
