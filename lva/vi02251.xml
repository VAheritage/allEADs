      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Norfolk County probably was named by Adam Thoroughgood, a local resident, for his native county in England. It was formed from Lower Norfolk County in 1691. Norfolk County became extinct in 1963, when it was consolidated with the city of South Norfolk to form the city of Chesapeake. Portsmouth, incorporated as a city in 1858, was previously part of Norfolk County.
</p>
      <p>An act passed by the Virginia legislature in 1803 required every free Black or free person of color to be registered and numbered in a book to be kept by the county clerk.
</p>
   <p>In 1806, the General Assembly moved to remove the free Black population from Virginia with a law that stated that any emancipated enslaved person, freed after May 1, 1806, who remained in the Commonwealth more than a year, would forfeit the right to freedom and be sold by the Overseers of the Poor for the benefit of the parish. Families wishing to stay were to petition the legislature through the local county court. Beginning in 1837, emancipated enslaved persons could petition the local courts for permission to remain. 
</p>
     <p>Beginning in 1778, enslavers who brought enslaved persons into Virginia were required to register the enslaved person with the county court and sign an oath agreeing not to bring enslaved persons into the commonwealth with the intent of selling them.
</p>
      <p>The General Assembly of Virginia passed a law as early as July 1, 1861, calling for the enrollment of free Blacks to work in the public service.
</p>
      <p>Eighteenth-century Virginia law required the removal of an ear for enslaved persons convicted of a range of crimes, from stealing to capital offenses.
