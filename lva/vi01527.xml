      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Nelson County was formed in 1807 from Amherst County. The county was named for Thomas Nelson Jr., governor of Virginia from June to November 1781.
</p>
      <p>Prior to 1853, when the Commonwealth began recording vital statistics, Virginia marriages were recorded at the county or city level. Beginning in 1661, in order to be married by license, the groom was required to go before the county clery and give bond with security that there was no lawful reason to prevent the marriage. The license, issued then by the clerk, was given to the minister who performed the service. Written consent from a parent or guardian was needed for individuals younger than twenty-one years.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Marriage Register, 1808-1878, is a list of marriage licenses issued in Nelson County. It is divided into two parts with various sections covered in Part I. Part I, pages 1-55, 1808-1850, records the date of the license, the names of the parties involved (groom first), the names of the securities present,the name of the person by whom married and the date of the marriage. Pages 51-71, 1847-1858, note additional information--to whom license fee was issued or paid. Entries for pages 72-116, July 1858-1878, incorporate additional categories--by what authority marriage license is issued, by whom license issued and to whom fee is paid. Also, the fees for marriage licenses are regularly recorded in this section. Entries from pages 100-116, 1872-1878, omit the name of the minister and date of marriage.  The microfilm copy of this volume includes only Part I of the register.  Part II of the register covering pages 1-81, 1808-1846, is a copy of an early register which was incorporated into Part I. The names of the parties involved (groom first) are listed before the date of the marriage license. In this part, all entries include to whom the license fee was paid. This information was not included when Part II became incorporated into Part I. 
</p>
      <p>An Index to Marriage Register, 1808-1878, is a separate volume. This typescript index contains the first and last names of both parties. It is arranged alphabetically from A-Z and in addition, lists alternate spellings of last names. This index is to Part I of the register with reference to the original (Part II) where there is any variation in names.  Unlike Part I of the register, the index was not microfilmed.
