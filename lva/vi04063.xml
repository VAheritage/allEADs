      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
      <p>Westmoreland County was named for the English county. It was formed from Northumberland County in 1653.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Westmoreland County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1753-1913 (bulk 1788-1873), are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
      <p>Chancery cases are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.

</unittitle>
        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>The plaintiff was a former resident of Westmoreland County currently living in Henrico County. Bailey hired Critcher to manager her large estate in Westmoreland County - land and enslaved people. She owned 75 enslaved people valued at 22,000 dollars in 1850. She accused Critcher of selling slaves without her permission. She identified three slaves - Octavia, Paul, and Jenny - who were sold at auction in Richmond. In his answer, Critcher acknowledged selling Bailey's slaves but it was for the purpose of paying debts owed by her estate. He recalled hiring out a slave named Nelson who ran away to Maryland where he was captured. A man named Turner claimed Nelson and took him as his property. Critcher filed suit against turner in Maryland to get Nelson back. Critcher argued that it was Bailey who wanted the three slaves sold in Richmond. "In January 1850, the conduct of three of the said negroes, to wit, Jenny, Octavia and Paul, was such that the complainant was no longer able on account of their characters to find them homes in the neighborhood without charge. They often put their own lives in jeopardy. Sometimes slept in the swamps in the coldest nights in winter. Sometimes attempted to hang themselves. And their conduct was attempted to be corrected by the mildest and best treatment on the part of those who hired them and of the complainant herself. Yet no change could be effected. Such was the constant anxiety of mind of the complainant on their account, that she frequently begged this respondent â¦ to sell them and relieve her of the greatest annoyance of her life." Critcher sold the three slaves in Richmond $1260.30. Richmond slave trader R.H. Dickinson was involved in the transaction.</p><p>Critcher accused Bailey's former agent John A. Parker of slandering him. Parker publicly accused Critcher of "selling 3 of her negroes without her knowledge or consent, and pocketing the money." Critcher wrote letters to local newspapers defending his honor two of which are exhibits in the chancery cause. In one of the letters, Critcher wrote that he and Parker had a physical altercation in the town of Tappahannock. Critcher pulled Parker's nose and Parker pulled a pistol on Critcher.</p>

          <p>Suit concerns the division of enslaved property. Numerous depositions  concern an enslaved woman named Ellen who is frequently referred to as "deranged."

</unittitle>
        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>Cause includes two letters dated July and September 1854 written by D.T. Wright living in St. Louis, Missouri. He was the guardian of the Carter children living in Virginia. Wright was responding to a question from the trustee of the children's slave property. The trustee wanted to know if Wright want to sell the slaves in Virginia and the funds be distributed among the heirs or have the slaves transported to Missouri. Wright informed the trustee to sell the slaves in Virginia and not transport them to Missouri. "There are several reasons why I think you had better sell them there than to have them sent here. They would naturally dislike to come to a strange place and into strange hands. Consequently, they would likely become dissatisfied and might endeavor to make their escape  to Illinois which is a free state and has the name of being connected with Canada by the underground railroad. One thing is quite certain. Our slaves often make their escape. There is also something of a risk and a considerable expense in bringing them here." In the second letter, Wright references a riot that took place in St. Louis following the 1854 Congressional election. He placed blame for the riot on the Irish.

          <p>Plaintiff was upset that the defendant, a game warden fined him 10 dollars for hunting game without a license required of non-residents of the state. Kennedy argued that he was a resident of the state and should not have been fined. Offered as proof his voter registration. Game warden claimed the plaintiff registered as a voter in order to avoid paying the fine. Court sided with plaintiff. </p>
