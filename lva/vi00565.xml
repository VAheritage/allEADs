      <p>WRVA was officially dedicated on 2 November 1925. Owned and
         operated by Larus &amp; Brother Company, manufacturers of
         Edgeworth Smoking Tobacco and other tobacco products, the
         station initially operated as a community station without
         commercial revenue and broadcast only two evenings a week. The
         Corn Cob Pipe Club was one of the many regular programs begun
         in 1925. It proved so popular with listeners throughout the
         United States and Canada that by July 1935, almost nine
         hundred clubs were established in the United States and
         foreign countries. By January 1926, the station increased its
         schedule to three nights a week, and by 1929, WRVA was
         broadcasting day and night seven days a week. Also in 1929,
         the station increased its power from 1,000 watts to 5,000
         watts and became affiliated with the National Broadcasting
         Company (NBC). In May 1933, WRVA opened new broadcasting
         studios in the Hotel Richmond, on 9th and Grace Streets. In
         April 1935, the station built and began using the first
         all-wood self-supporting radio tower in America. On 27 June
         1937, WRVA joined Columbia Broadcasting Systems (CBS) as a
         full time affiliate. On 17 March 1939, the 50,000 watt
         transmitter, located in eastern Henrico County was officially
         dedicated. In March 1940, Sunshine Sue and Her Rangers first
         broadcast on WRVA. In September 1946, WRVA leased the old
         Lyric Theater on 9th and Broad Street and the Old Dominion
         Barn Dance began airing on WRVA. On 28 January 1959, WRVA
         rejoined NBC. On 29 May 1968, the new WRVA studio, located in
         historic Church Hill and overlooking Richmond, was
         dedicated.</p>
      <p>In 1968, Larus &amp; Brother Company reorganized and became
         the Larus Investing Company. In July 1968, WRVA AM and FM
         became WRVA Radio, Inc. and WRVA-FM Radio, Inc., respectively,
         subsidiary corporations of the Larus Investing Company. Larus
         Investing Company sold its entire WRVA stock to Southern
         Broadcasting Company of Winston, Salem, North Carolina in
         November 1969. In August 1977, Harte-Hanks Newspapers, Inc.,
         purchased Southern Broadcasting Company, including WRVA-AM and
         WRVQ-FM. Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc., sold the radio
         stations to Edens Broadcasting Company, a company formed by
         the senior managers of Harte- Hanks Radio, Inc., a subsidiary
         of Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc., in December 1984. In
         September 1991, WRVA was sold to Force II Communication, L.
         P., of San Diego. In the Spring 1992, Clear Channel
         Communications bought WRVA and is the current owner.</p>

      <p>The WRVA Radio Collection spans seventy-five years and
         contains applause letters, minutes, anniversary booklets,
         program scripts, program guides, newsletters, histories,
         interviews, employee questionnaires, sales manuals, audience
         and sales promotions, rate cards, listener surveys, posters,
         newspaper clippings, FCC applications and reports, drawings,
         photographs, and sound recordings. This material documents the
         history of WRVA, the role the station played in Virginia and
         Richmond for over half-a-century, and the development of radio
         in Virginia and the United States. The collection is also rich
         in material on the Larus &amp; Brother Company, including
         histories, anniversary booklets, photographs of officials,
         employees, and factories, and promotions.</p>
      <p>The sound recordings date from the 1930's to the 1990's and
         contain news broadcasts of significant local, state, national,
         and world events and personalities, programs of a local and
         regional interest, including the Capitol Squirrel, Calling All
         Cooks, the Radio Scholarship Quiz, and the Quiz of Two Cities,
         and musical programs, such as the Corn Cob Pipe Club, the Old
         Dominion Barn Dance, the Sunshine Hour, and the Silver Star
         Quartet. Selected sound recordings are now available for use on       CD.  Each CD has been cataloged individually. Search The Library of Virginia Archives and Manuscripts Catalog to find WRVA sound recordings of interest.</p>

          <p>The applause memos contain comments from listeners on
               the station's programming and document the strength of
               WRVA's signal. The geographical distribution of applause
               letters received reveals that WRVA had listeners from
               the Atlantic Provinces of Canada to California. The
               correspondence file includes letters, memos, and
               telegrams regarding matters relating to the running of
               the station, station policy, the hiring and promotion of
               employees, and listener responses to programming.
               Correspondence also documents the transfer of part of
               WRVA's archives to the University of Virginia. The
               public service correspondence includes letters from
               listeners commenting and/or expressing thanks for WRVA
               programming. In many cases, a response from WRVA is
               included.</p>

          <p>Contains material used and created by the WRVA Sales
               Department to attract advertisers, including manuals,
               advertisements, advertising booklets and displays,
               client presentations, newsletters, rate cards, and
               surveys. The advertisements, booklets, and displays were
               created to convey the listening power of WRVA and the
               benefits advertisers would received from advertising on
               the radio. The surveys contain information on the habits
               and preferences of WRVA's listening audience. The rate
               cards span from the 1930's to the 1960's and illustrate
               the costs of advertising on the radio. Also includes
               copies of WRVAds from 1950 to 1953, the sales department
               newsletter, which contained information on

          <p>WRVA Dialog was the program guide for national and
               local programs airing on WRVA Radio. The guides included
               highlights of programs, time listings, and numerous
               photographs. Unfortunately, several significant gaps
               exist.</p>

          <p>This series contains photographs that document the
               visual history of WRVA from its opening program on
               November 2, 1925 to 2000. Includes photographs of WRVA's
               studios and transmitters; staff, announcers, and
               performers; staff parties; broadcasts; special events;
               public service and community activities; anniversaries;
               programs; local, state and national politicians; and
               Larus &amp; Brother Company. Some of the folders for
               WRVA staff contain biographical and program
               information.</p>
          <p>Individual folders exist for some staff, performers,
               and events. However, there are several broad categories
               the researcher should consult for photographs of staff,
               performers, and events. Many of the photographs of
               performers are grouped into Performers or Performers,
               Early. Staff photographs are grouped together in Staff,
               Individual or Staff, Group. Events are generally located
               under Special Events. Photographs of broadcasts can
               found under Broadcasts or Broadcasts, Remote.</p>
          <p>The albums primarily contain 4 x 8 photographs of
               staff and staff events from 1985 to 2000.</p>

            <p>Contains recordings of a series of news broadcasts from Jack Clements and Walter R. Bishop of WRVA radio at the 1956 Democratic National Convention. Intended for the listeners back home in Virginia, these broadcasts, direct from Chicago, primarily cover the activities of the Virginia delegation during the convention. Of note is John Battle's work on the platform committee and its adoption of a civil rights plank. Southern delegations were adamant in their refusal to support any platform that endorsed the Supreme Court decision regarding school desegregation. The news broadcasts contain news from each candidates' camp and the prospects of a floor fight over the civil rights plank of the platform. Also includes the Virginia delegation's response to Tennessee Governor Frank G. Clement's keynote speech, its feelings on the various candidates, and its decision to support John S. Battle for president.</p>

Listeners immediately started contacting Aaroe, alerting him to the insidious evil of bamboo and the damage it can do to a person's yard, plants and driveway. Another listener wrote in to tell him, conversely, that the United States government was supporting bamboo as the new crop for southern farmers. Aaroe also briefly talks about Mother's Day and does a voice advertisement for Markow's Florist. The recording begins with an advertisement for the 1958 University of Richmond-WRVA Radio Scholarship Quiz. </p>

            <p>Contains sound clips of convention events and news commentary for a documentary produced by WRVA and narrated by George Passage entitled "The Story of John Battle and the 1952 Democratic National Convention." The documentary examines John Battle's role in the fight against the loyalty pledge, which the Virginia delegates believed bound them to support the nominee before he was selected, and the platform before it was adopted. Louisiana, South Carolina, and Virginia refused to support the loyalty pledge and were almost denied participation in the convention. The recordings include excerpts of speeches of Battle, Governor Adlai Stevenson, presidential nominee from Illinois, Senator Richard Russell of Georgia, and the roll call of voting on the resolution. Battle's speech was instrumental in the resolution's defeat. The commentary of George Passage puts the speeches and roll call in context, and provides background information on the events of the convention. The sound clips of the convention events and news commentary are separate. The convention events are the first four tracks and the news commentary are the last two tracks. The news commentary recordings set up each sound clip of the convention events.</p>

            <p>Drama concerning the dangers of road rage. George Lott demonstrates a pleasant disposition when dealing with his wife and co-workers, but when behind the wheel, he is impatient and drives offensively. Then the drama reverses George's life. He is rude and impatient to his wife and co-workers, and slaps a co-worker boasting about speeding away from police. When asked why he slapped the man, George tells a story about driving with his family and getting in an accident that killed his children. The moral of the story is that "bad manners can kill you socially, bad manners on the highway can kill you permanently." This recording is track 2 on WRVA - 337.</p>

            <p> These are recordings of Jack Clements' broadcasts back to the WRVA studios while participating in an Air Force press tour in the spring of 1958. Clements joined reporters from all over the country as guests of the United States Air Force on tours of Bermuda, the Azores, England, France and Germany, usually visiting air bases. Clements reports on the people, landscape and culture of each place. As this is an Air Force sponsored tour, much of the focus is on the reactions of local citizens to the presence of the American military in their country, or the feelings of Americans living abroad. While in Europe, the interviews address the defense of the various countries against attacks of Soviet aggression, the business of NATO and rebuilding efforts following World War II.  </p>

The recording begins with a brief part of a speech in which Harry Flood Byrd discusses his decision to run for re-election to the United States Senate. Byrd is followed by Governor J. Lindsay Almond's long introduction of the main speaker, Herman E. Talmadge, United States Senator from Georgia. The remainder of the recording is of Talmadge's speech, which focuses on praising Virginia's policy of Massive Resistance in response to the Supreme Court's decision of forced integration in the public schools, while criticizing the lack of government spending on the military. He rounds out his speech with criticism of the federal leaders for spending too much money on foreign aid, at the expense of domestic programs at home.</p>

            <p>Recording of the Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner in the Grand Hall of the Hotel John Marshall. Watkins M. Abbitt, chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee and Fourth District Congressman, introduces the keynote speaker, Governor Mills E. Godwin, Jr. The bulk of the recording is Godwin's speech. Godwin praises the current Democrats of Virginia's congressional delegation, retired Senator A. Willis Robertson, retired Congressman Howard W. Smith, and the late Harry F. Byrd, Sr. He outlines the accomplishments of Byrd's gubernatorial term and criticizes the Republican Party's opposition to certain legislation. He fears the splitting of the Democratic Party into its divergent factions more than the power of the Republican Party. He calls for Democrats to make the party's diversity its strength. The first fifteen minutes of this recording is barely audible and primarily contains the voices of WRVA broadcasters preparing for the recording of Governor Godwin's speech.</p>

            <p> The Legislative Roundup was a daily program covering highlights of the activities of both the Virginia House of Delegates and the Senate during the 1958 session of the General Assembly. Jack Clements hosted the program, with the assistance of Harry Monroe and Frank Wilson. Each program included a run-down of the day's activities provided by the radio announcers, which was interspersed with interviews and commentary from various delegates and senators. Examples of topics covered in some interviews include committee work and legislation involving everything from bills regarding quail season, disciplinary spanking in the classroom and minimum milk prices, to various attempts to either curb or enhance both Virginia's policy of Massive Resistance and Governor Almond's level of executive power in response to the threat of federal troops enforcing the integration of public schools in the Commonwealth.</p>

From the balcony of the campus' Christopher Wren Building, the Queen and Prince appear and are welcomed by James M. Robertson, Rector of the Board of Visitors of the College of William and Mary.

Prince Philip is greeted by Alvin Duke Chandler, President of the College of William and Mary, and the two exchange gifts between the College and the University of Edinburgh, the alma mater of the College's first president, the Reverend James Blair.</p>

            <p> Hosted by Lon Backman, this show features four different programs devoted to the issue of annexation of Henrico County by the City of Richmond. The date of the programs are not known, but thought to be from 1960. Backman interviews various individuals involved in the annexation/consolidation controversy. Horace Edwards, Richmond City Manager, discusses the annexation ordinance process, various studies taking place, court procedures, annexation case questions, costs involved, referendum procedures, and statewide trends in annexation cases. A. Howe Todd, executive director of the Richmond Regional Planning Commission, talks about the work and composition of the Commission, the merger/annexation process, tax issues, differences between annexation and merger, and the work of the Public Administration Service (PAS). Richmond City Councilman J. Edward Lawler explains the issues involved, tax burden, business tax revenues in the city vs. county tax revenues, who would benefit from annexation, the chances of annexation succeeding, the resolution introduced by him on annexation, effect of the recent flood in Richmond on the issue, and race and school issues and their effect on the proposal. Joseph T. Williams, Jr., a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, states his position on the issue and why is vehemently opposed to annexation, discusses his legislative work in the General Assembly on the topic, and how issues of race could affect the question of annexation. Burl A. Parks, director of city planning, sums up the issues involved in annexation, merger, and status quo. Parks discusses what the alternatives are, forms of government, services provided, and tax issues involved in all three options.  </p>

The topic of discussion is a bill introduced into the House of Delegates calling for a local option referendum on serving whiskey and other spirits by the drink. Norfolk delegates Calvin Childress and Henry Howell, the patrons of the bill, are Backman's guests. The basis of the bill was the creation of a new type of liquor license to be administered by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to regulate hotels and restaurants serving spirits by the drink. There was a concern that without the passage of this bill, the Tidewater area would suffer due to competition with other Atlantic seaboard resorts unencumbered by laws preventing such sales. Childress and Howell state that this bill would benefit Virginia tourism statewide and would put the decision making on whether to allow such sales in the hands of the people of each locality, rather than the General Assembly. The opposition from some religious groups is also discussed.</p>

            <p>Titled Governor Tuck, this is a recording of Tuck's address before a joint session of the General Assembly, which convened to consider increasing "salaries of public school teachers, labor legislation and other matters which may appear urgent." The speech takes place in the Hall of the House of Delegates in the Virginia State Capitol, in a gallery "unusually well-filled" with proponents and opponents of both the labor issues and public educators' salaries.

            <p>Governor Tuck is interviewed regarding his views on the current labor problem, meaning specifically a coal strike led by the United Mine Workers. According to Tuck, the coal strike, in which miners walked off the job without any regard for the public interest or public safety, was a very unpatriotic action. He calls for the repeal of the Wagner Labor Act, allowing states, not the federal government, to regulate labor. He calls the strike an insurrection, "a challenge by highly organized, blindly following minorities against law and public morality." He blames labor unrest on "the gang of dangerous and desperate despots" and politicians more interested "in enjoying 	the fruits of their office than they are in the public welfare." Interviewer also references Tuck's March 1946 threat to draft electric and power company workers into the Virginia Militia to prevent them from striking and asks him his opinion on John L. Lewis, the president of the United Mine Workers. Tuck also discusses the State Corporation Commission's charge against Lewis and the United Mine Workers for selling union memberships in Virginia, a suit first brought by the Richmond Better Business Bureau.</p>

            <p> This is a recording of a program, hosted by Walter Cronkite, highlighting the "voices of Virginians speaking on one issue: the schools and who will attend them." The issue is school integration and Virginia's legislated agenda to prevent desegregation in the public schools, also known as Massive Resistance. The program is marked by sound bites from Governor Almond, as well as discussions of the Virginia General Assembly's passage of laws forcing the closure of schools forced to integrate and giving the governor the power either to reopen the schools on a segregated basis or deny state funding to those that do integrate. The program also includes quotes from officials and citizens on both sides of the issue. Specific situations in Norfolk, Arlington and Charlottesville are discussed in detail, with Cronkite's ultimately concludes that "Virginians are not of a single mind" on this issue.</p>
