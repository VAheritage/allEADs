      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>William Mahone was born 1 December 1826 in Southampton County, Virginia, to Fielding Jordan Mahone (1802-1855) and Martha Drew Mahone (1804-1868). He graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1847 and then taught at the Rappahannock Military Academy. He studied engineering and became engineer of several Virginia railroads. Mahone was serving as president of the Norfolk &amp; Petersburg Railroad in 1861 when the Civil War began. As colonel of the 6th Virginia infantry, Mahone took part in the capture of the Norfolk Navy Yard, and commanded the Norfolk district until its evacuation. He served in the Army of Northern Virginia from the battle of Seven Pines until Appomattox, except when recovering from a wound received at the second battle of Manassas. Mahone was commissioned a brigadier-general 16 November 1861 and a major-general 30 July 1864. After the Civil War, Mahone created the railroad system which became the Norfolk &amp; Western. Mahone built Virginia's Readjuster party, which was aligned with the national Republican party, and served as United States senator from 1881 to 1887. He died 8 October 1895 in Petersburg, Virginia and is buried at Blandford Cemetery.
</p>
      <p>William Mahone married Otelia Butler (1836-1911) of Southampton County, Virginia, daughter of Robert Butler (1784-1853) and Otelia Voinard Butler (1803-1855) 8 February 1855. They had 13 children, but only 3 survived to adulthood. One of the three was Robert Butler Mahone, who was born 18 October 1858. Mahone was appointed United States Consul at Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, by President William McKinley (1843-1901) 22 January 1898. Mahone later served as a book keeper in the customs service in Petersburg. Never married, he died 18 August 1914 and was buried in his parents' vault in Blandford cemetery.
