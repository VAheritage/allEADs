</head>
<p>Marion Johnson Dimmock was born in Portsmouth, Virginia in 1824 and moved to Richmond in 1833. He served in the Confederate Army, attaining the rank of captain. He became one of the most prolific Virginia
architects in the period 1870-1900. Among his more prominant commissions during this period were the Confederate Memorial Chapel (1887), a hotel in Elkton, Virginia (1890), Richmond Chamber of Commerce Building
(1891-1892), Mortuary Chapel in Hollywood Cemetery (1897-1898), and an addition to the State Library Building (Dimmock &amp; Lee, 1908).

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This set of drawings shows elevations, sections, floor plans, and details for the Mortuary Chapel on the grounds of Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia. Marion Johnson Dimmock won the commission from the
Hollywood Board of Directors in July 1897. The architect added to an existing Gothic Revival structure used by the cemetery gatekeeper. With James River granite, Dimmock raised the height of the tower and added
crenelation and a conical slate roof. The chapel portion of the structure, with its parapet roof and buttresses, was added to the north side of the existing tower. Dimmock's addition leans toward the Romanesque
Revival style, but is in keeping with the existing portion. The building features a receiving vault, elevator, company offices, and one hundred seat chapel. The work was completed in May 1898. This building is
still extant, but was significantly altered in 1972.
</p>
<p>These drawings have Dimmock's office stamp requesting that they be returned, indicating that these are original records from his architectural practice.
