<p>The original volumes were compiled by the Virginia State Library's (now the Library of Virginia) Archives Division from the original court records found in the Botetourt County Circuit Court Clerk's Office.  The microfilm copy of these volumes was generated by The Genealogical Society of Utah--while filming on-site at the Library of Virginia.

<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Botetourt County was formed in 1769 from Augusta County. Part of Rockbridge County was added in 1785. It was named for Norborne Berkeley, baron de Botetourt, the royal governor who served from 1768 to 1770.
</p>
<p>Prior to 1853, when the Commonwealth began recording vital statistics, Virginia marriages were recorded at the county or city level. Beginning in 1661, in order to be married by license, the groom was required to go before the county clerk and give bond with security that there was no lawful reason to prevent the marriage. The license, issued then by the clerk, was given to the minister who performed the service.
Written consent from a parent or guardian was needed for individuals younger than twenty-one years.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Marriage Register, 1770-1853, is divided into two separate volumes. The first volume covering pages 1-346, 1770-1830, records the date of the marriage bond, the names of both parties, the names of the parents or guardians present and the names of the security or witnesses in attendance.  In addition, there are a number of marriages between free persons of color--pages 165, 181, 230, 250 and 302.
</p>
<p>The second volume covering pages 347-705, 1831-1853, essentially records the same information found in the first volume but is divided into a number of sections. Of note, there is a marriage between free persons of color on page 354.  Pages 503-687 of this volume detail a separate
section covering 1782-1853. The following information is included on these pages--the date of the marriage, the names of both parties, the minister's name, the religious denomination of the minister and a remarks section (which lists the authority by which a party was married--by license, by license from another county or by "banns.") Marriage banns, published in the parish church where the couple lived, constituted a legal substitute for a marriage license prior to 1848.  Pages 687-689 of this volume, 1834-1852, detail information related to undated marriage licenses. Pages 691-703 of this volume, 1793-1853, record information found in additional county marriage registers and page 705 of this volume records recommendations for minister's licenses from 1781, 1784-1785.  
</p>
<p>An Index to Marriage Registers, 1770-1853, is a separate volume.  It is arranged alphabetically from A-Z according to the last and first names of both parties.  Alternate spellings of last names are included with a "see also" reference following the standard spelling.  Occasionally, this volume also lists alternate names of individuals (aliases) in parentheses.
