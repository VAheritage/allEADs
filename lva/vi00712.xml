         <p>Thomas McFadden was born 9 November 1825 in Rushville,
         Ohio. He studied medicine and practiced in Rushville until he
         moved to Westerville, Ohio, in 1855. McFadden served as the
         town doctor and began a career at Otterbein College, becoming
         professor of natural science. When the Civil War began, he
         enlisted as a surgeon with the 46th Ohio Infantry. He was
         honorably discharged in 1862 because of poor health, but
         reenlisted in 1863 and served as a surgeon at Camp Chase.
         After the war ended, he returned to his duties at Otterbein
         College. McFadden married Rebecca Hartley and they had at
         least three children. McFadden died 9 November 1883.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>Letters, 1869, of Thomas McFadden (1825-1883) of
         Westerville, Ohio, to Lewis McKenzie (1810-1895), president of
         the Alexandria, Loudoun, and Hampshire Railraod, and to
         Colonel H. S. McComb (1828-1881) of Wilmington, Delaware,
         detailing his geological survey along the proposed route of
         the Alexandria, Loudoun, and Hampshire railroad through
         Virginia and West Virginia. He offers astute analysis on the
         geological and mineral formations of the region as well as on
         the local inhabitants. Letters consist of: McFadden to
         McKenzie, 24 June 1869, describing the good quality and
         quantity of marble and sandstone he found in Loudoun County,
         Virginia, discussing the copper ore, iron ore, and gold he
         found there, commenting on Loudoun County's potential for
         agricultural prosperity, a recommending laying the rail lines
         south of Leesburg, Virginia; McFadden to McComb, 3 July 1869,
         detailing his survey of Clarke and Frederick Counties and
         Winchester, Virginia, noting quartz, limestone and lead,
         commenting on the great amount of iron ore in the area,
         warning that the purchase of real property in the area might
         be difficult, stating that the inhabitants have a strong
         dislike of "yankees," and providing a rough map of the area
         discussed; and McFadden to McComb, 1 September 1869, stating
         that he is back in Westerville after travelling to Wilmington,
         Delaware, to see McComb, discussing the lack of minerals,
         especially coal, in Hampshire and Hardy Counties, West
         Virginia, warning McComb that a group of New York businessmen
         have a charter to build a railroad through these counties,
         discussing the possibility of purchasing real property, and
         praising the beautiful scenery through which the proposed
         Alexandria, Loudoun, and Hampshire Railroad will pass.</p>
