</head>
<p>Thomas McFadden was born 9 November 1825 in Rushville, Ohio. He studied medicine and practiced in Rushville until he moved to Westerville, Ohio, in 1855. McFadden served as the town doctor and began a career at Otterbein College, becoming professor of natural science. When the Civil War began, he enlisted as a surgeon with the 46th Ohio Infantry. He was honorably discharged in 1862 because of poor health, but reenlisted in 1863 and served as a surgeon at Camp Chase. After the war ended, he returned to his duties at Otterbein College. McFadden married Rebecca Hartley and they had at least three children. McFadden died 9 November 1883.
