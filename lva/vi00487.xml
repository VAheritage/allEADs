      <p>The Kilby family were prominent residents of Hanover and
         Nansemond Counties, Virginia. John Kilby (1758-1826) of
         Maryland married Elizabeth Thompson (1763-1818) on 25 December
         1787 in Hanover County, Virginia. They had six children: John
         Thompson (1789-1838), Turpin (1792-1793), Turpin (1794-1832),
         Harriet (1797-1865), Spotswood (1800-1818), and Thomas
         Jefferson Kilby (1803-1881). John Thompson Kilby married Ann
         Newton (Jones) Baker (1800-1857), daughter of Matthias Jones
         and Mary (Riddick) Jones, and widow of Joseph B. Baker, at
         Suffolk, Virginia, on 1 May 1817. Harriet Kilby married Samuel
         Corbell on 4 May 1838 in Nansemond County, Virginia, and John
         L. Collins of Louisa County, Virginia, on 20 May 1855. Thomas
         Jefferson Kilby married Ann Upshur Smith (1803-1879) and
         Turpin Kilby married Martha Glazebrook (1796-1878) on 6 March
         1817.</p>
      <p>John Richardson Kilby (1819-1878), second of the seven
         children of Turpin (1794-1832) and Martha (Glazebrook) Kilby
         (1796-1878), was born in Hanover County, Virginia. He served
         as sheriff of Nansemond County, lawyer, member of the Virginia
         Convention, 1861, and served in the Virginia House of
         Delegates, 1849-1852. He married Martha Jane Louisa
         (1816-1888), daughter of Arthur (1779-1849) and Susan
         (Richardson) Smith (1781-), on 5 December 1838. Arthur Smith
         (1779-1849) operated a general store in Suffolk, Virginia, and
         served as postmaster of Suffolk, from 1804-1845. They had
         eight children, Walter, Leroy Richardson (1841- 1883), Wallace
         (1843-1899), Susan (1845-1917), Arthur Turpin (1847-1851),

      <p>Wilbur John Kilby (1850-1907), sixth of the eight children
         of John Richardson and Martha Jane Louisa Kilby, was educated
         at Randolph Macon College and University of Virginia. He was a
         lawyer in Suffolk, Virginia, and judge of the County Court of
         Nansemond, Virginia. He was also examiner of records in the
         second judicial circuit and the superintendent of Cedar Hill
         Cemetery in Nansemond County. He married Harriett Lanetta
         Brownley (1855-1887), daughter of Mary (1818-1881) and Joseph
         (d. 1878) Brownley of King and Queen County, Virginia, on 5

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Kilby family papers, 1665-1947, are organized into 4
         series: Kilby family Papers, John R. Kilby Papers, Wilbur J.
         Kilby Papers, and Arthur Smith Papers. The collection includes
         accounts, bills of sale, certificates, clippings,
         correspondence, deeds, estate accounts, genealogical notes,
         ledgers, marriage records, memoirs, military records,
         obituaries, plats, postmasters accounts, promissory notes,
         receipts, sheriff fee and tax books, slave records, surveys,
         and wills, documenting a prominent Nansemond County, Virginia
         family.</p>
      <p>These papers are most notable because they contain many
         records relating to Nansemond County, a county for which many
         records are no longer extant. Included are numerous deeds,
         plats, surveys, and wills, 1665- 1931. (An individual listing
         of each deed and will can be found in Appendix A at the end of
         the finding aid.) Included are overseer of the poor records
         and account books of levies and fees collected by John R.
         Kilby, as sheriff of Nansemond County, from c. 1840-1870.
         Included are accounts of the post office of Nansemond County,
         1804-1844, when Arthur Smith was postmaster of the county.
         Also included are many estate accounts of Nansemond County
         residents, found in the John R. Kilby series. There are also
         many slave records throughout the collection, which include
         names, birth and death dates. Of note are letters from Randal
         Kilby, a former slave of the Kilby family who had gained his
         freedom and resettled in Liberia. This correspondence may be
         found in Series I: Kilby family papers.</p>
      <p>The collection also includes military records from the 59th
         Virginia Militia, 1812, and the 16th Virginia Infantry,
         Confederate States of America. A memoir written by John Kilby
         describes his experiences in the Revolutionary war and his
         work with John Paul Jones (1747-1792). Also included are
         numerous genealogical notes and obituaries on the Blackwell,
         Glazebrook, Kilby, Riddick, Smith, and Thompson families of
         Hanover and Nansemond County and Norfolk, Virginia.</p>
      <p>Appendixes A and B are not available online. A copy of the
         appendixes may be requested from the library.</p>

               by folder title in four boxes and six oversize folders
               (see oversize folders 1-6). This series consists of
               accounts, clippings, correspondence, deeds, genealogical
               notes, notebooks, obituaries, plats and surveys,
               promissory notes, receipts, suit papers, and wills.</p>
          <p>Included are slave records, 1833-1854, containing
               receipts for the hire of slaves and a list of
               Washington, Henning, and Sarah Smith's slaves,
               1853-1854; a notebook listing the members of the Suffolk
               Committee of Native Americans, 1855; and genealogical
               notes and obituaries from the Blackwell, Glazebrook,
               Kilby, Riddick, Smith, and Thompson families of Hanover
               and Nansemond County, Virginia. Within the genealogical
               notes are included letters to Bradford and Wilbur Kilby,
               1890-1943, from family members researching their

               orders issued from the Adjutant and Inspector General's
               office, Richmond, Virginia, 1863-1864, from newspapers;
               and clippings and notes related to the history of
               Nansemond County, Virginia, 1893-1931.</p>
          <p>Within this series are the papers of some individual
               members of the Kilby family, such as Bradford Kilby,
               John Kilby, Leroy Kilby, and Josiah Riddick. The
               Bradford Kilby papers include correspondence,
               certificates from Randolph Macon College, and ration
               books. Of note within his papers are the record items of
               Suffolk Council, 1883-1907, compiled by Simon M.
               Lawrence, clerk of the Suffolk Council. This record is a
               compiled list of items presented to the Suffolk Council
               in the period 1883-1907, such as names of councilmen who
               served in Suffolk, when lights were introduced in the
               city, census statistics, what efforts were made for the
               poor, and the pavement of streets. The John Kilby papers
               included memoirs of the Revolutionary war and military
               career of John Paul Jones (1747-1792), written by John
               Kilby in September 1810. The Leroy R. Kilby papers
               include reports, returns, and muster rolls of the 16th
               Virginia Infantry, Company B, Confederate States of
               America, commanded by Captain Leroy R. Kilby. The Josiah
               Riddick papers, 1813-1814, contain muster rolls for the
               59th Virginia Militia and a list of officers belonging
               to the 2nd regiment in the War of 1812. The Cowper
               family papers, 1842-1896, including accounts,
               correspondence, and receipts. Of note is a letter, 27
               May 1861, to Fannie Cowper, Suffolk, Virginia, from a
               cousin in North Carolina, discussing the beginnings of
               the Civil War and sentiments in the South.</p>
          <p>Of note within the collection are the deeds, plats
               and surveys, and wills, 1665-1931, mainly from Nansemond
               County and Norfolk, Virginia. Many of the records
               pre-1866 of Nansemond County were burned, so these
               records provide information that is no longer extant.
               Deeds, patents, and wills exist for the: Allmond,
               Arnold, Bennett, Benton, Bernard, Boykin, Brewer, Brock,

               students, 1870-1903, of Suffolk Female Institute
               (Suffolk, Va.). The register contains the names of
               students, residence, age, name of parents, and sometimes
               death date. The front of the ledger includes marriage
               records of some of the students, including brides and
               grooms names, place and date of wedding. These records
               were copied and cataloged separately as MBRC 62
               (accession 40347). Included are correspondence,
               promissory notes, agreements, and receipts for the
               Florida Land Association, 1859-1869, a joint venture
               between James Evans, Robert Webb, Nathaniel Riddick,
               Richard Riddick, and John R. Kilby, to purchase land on
               the Caloosahatchee River near Ft. Myers, Florida. The
               papers contain correspondence regarding the purchase and
               farming of the land; license for the purchase of a ship,
               "Belle"; receipts for the hiring of slaves from Virginia
               to work in Florida; and a receipt for slaves kept at
               Charleston Work House. Of note is a letter to James
               Evans, 27 July 1861, regarding the outbreak of the Civil
               War and the effect the war would have on the land
               venture.</p>

          <p>The John R. Kilby papers are arranged alphabetically
               by folder title in three boxes and fourteen volumes and
               divided into two subseries. Subseries have been
               designated for Papers; and Accounts books and ledgers.
               This series consists of accounts, bank books, bills of
               sale, broadsides, contracts, correspondence, estate
               accounts and records, ledgers, promissory notes,
               receipts, and county records, of John R. Kilby of
               Nansemond County, Virginia. The paper subseries relate
               mostly to Kilby's personal and professional life as a
               lawyer and member of the Virginia House of Delegates,
               1849-1852. The account books and ledgers relate mainly
               to his career as sheriff of Nansemond County, c.
               1840-1870.</p>

            <p>Included within this subseries are accounts and
                  receipts, 1834-1877, for subscriptions, merchandise,
                  taxes, doctors, clothing, tuition, attorney fees, and
                  court fees. Of note are the bills of sale for slaves,
                  1840-1860. The bills often include the age or date of
                  birth and first name of the slaves. The bills are
                  also interesting because of a note written 22 January
                  1902 by Wilbur J. Kilby, in which he states the need
                  to preserve the papers, in the case that the United
                  States government reimburses the family for the
                  prices of the slaves that were set free during the
                  Civil War.</p>
            <p>The papers also include a broadside for the sale
                  of the land of Joseph Bunch in Nansemond County,
                  1853; estate accounts with the family of Richard H.
                  Riddick and W.B. Whitehead; military commission of
                  the 59th Infantry regiment of the Virginia Militia,
                  1843; and stock certificates from the Suffolk Savings
                  Bank, 1852-1859. The oaths include Kilby's oath as an
                  attorney in Richmond, Virginia, 1855; amnesty oaths
                  of Richard H. Riddick, James B. Norfleet, Elisha
                  Norfleet, George W. Briggs, Robert R. Smith, Richard
                  T. Riddick, Bartholomew Bowers, Henry L. Tynes,
                  Samuel Eley, and John E. Humes, 1865; and a copy of
                  the amnesty proclamation, 1865.</p>
            <p>Topics of the correspondence include numerous
                  legal cases in Nansemond County, family, finances,
                  health, estate accounts, and local, national, and
                  internationals politics. Of note is a letter from
                  W.L. Riddick, 2 December 1849, regarding the Whig
                  party; letter, 27 January 1850, from John Bunch, on
                  the subject of growing tensions between the North and
                  South; letter, 17 May 1852, from Nathaniel Riddick,
                  regarding Virginia politics; letter, 1853 October 22,
                  from Washington Riddick on his travels through Europe
                  and European politics; letter, 9 December 1854, from
                  William Wright, regarding the hiring of slaves at
                  Yates Free School in Norfolk, Virginia; and a letter,
                  29 January, 1857, from Harriet Collins, Kilby's aunt,
                  and 23 December 1858, from B. Devany, regarding the
                  sale of slaves; and letters dated 20 May 1868, 20
                  July 1868, and 1 December 1868, regarding Virginia

          <p>The Wilbur J. Kilby papers are arranged
               alphabetically by folder title in one box, three
               volumes, and one oversize folder (see oversize folder
               7). This series consists of appointments, circulars,
               correspondence, endorsements, estate accounts,
               graduation certificates, marriage licenses, notes from
               the University of Virginia law program, and receipts. Of
               note are the papers relating to Kilby's career as a
               lawyer and judge in Nansemond County, Virginia. Kilby
               served as county court judge, superintendent of the
               cemetery, commissioner of accounts of the court, and
               judge of the first judicial circuit. Included are
               appointment and election results, 1883-1905, containing
               official documents certifying to the authenticity of the
               election results; circulars endorsing Kilby for
               judgeship in Nansemond County, 1885-1893; graduation
               degrees from Randolph Macon College and the University
               of Virginia, 1868-1872; and his attorney license,
               1872.</p>
          <p>Kilby was the administrator and/or executor for the
               estates of many family members and the collection
               includes accounts, receipts, promissory notes, bills,
               circulars for land sale, and correspondence relating to
               the estate accounts. On some estates Wilbur took over as
               executor when his father (John R. Kilby) died in 1878.
               Included are records for the estates of Alfred Adkins
               (d. 1879), John R. Kilby (d. 1878), Martha J. Kilby (d.
               1888), Wilbur J. Kilby (d. 1907), Andrew McAlister (d.
               1879), Nathaniel P. Phillips (d. 1878), and William
               Quillen (d. 1875). Of note is the estate of Alfred
               Akins, a freed black man of Nansemond County, Virginia.
               Included is Adkins will, 1879; receipts for taxes paid
               from 1849-1879; funeral expenses; circular announcing

               and appraisement of the household goods, 1879; and
               correspondence. Adkins left half of his estate to Alfred
               White (b. 1872), the son of Martha White of Pennsylvania
               and designated Wilbur Kilby as guardian of White, until
               he turned 21. Also included within the estate records
               are accounts, bills, correspondence and receipts
               relating to White's inheritance, 1879-1883.</p>

          <p>The Arthur Smith papers are arranged alphabetically
               by folder title in one box and one oversize folder (see
               oversize folder 8). This series consists of account
               books, circulars, clippings, correspondence, daybooks,
               promissory notes, and receipts of Arthur Smith of
               Nansemond County, Virginia. Included are numerous
               accounts of the post office of Nansemond County,
               1804-1812, where Smith was postmaster from 1804-1844.
               Also included are receipts for monies paid on behalf of
               the post office, circulars announcing rate increases,
               and quarterly reports. Also included is an account book
               of the post office, 1832-1844, contains postal accounts
               and a list of subscribers of various newspapers and
               magazines, such as the Richmond Christian Advocate,
               Christian Sentinel, Norfolk Herald, Norfolk Beacon, and
               the Philadelphia Courier (Pa.).</p>
          <p>Also includes a summons for Smith to appear before
               the justice of the peace in Suffolk, Virginia, 1849, tax
               receipts for Nansemond County, 1849, and receipts for
               the purchase of insurance from the Mutual Assurance
               Society of Virginia. Smith also operated a general store
               in Nansemond County and the collection includes a
               daybook, 1809-1825. The daybook records purchase amounts
               and payment for cloth, dry goods, hardware, tobacco,
               lumber, and iron.</p>
          <p>When Arthur Smith died in 1849, his son-in-law, John
               R. Kilby, was appointed executor of the estate, and
               receipts and promissory notes are included from the
               estate settlement, 1850-1853. Also included are two
               newspaper articles from the Norfolk Virginian Pilot on
               the history of Nansemond County postmasters, 1932 and
               1937.</p>
