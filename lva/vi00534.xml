</head>
      <p>The Highway Safety Division was created to promote highway safety by an act of the General Assembly passed on April 4, 1968. The same act created the Highway Safety Commission to advise the division, and a coordinating committee to promote cooperation among state agencies in carrying out the highway safety program established by the division. An act passed by the General Assembly on April 10, 1978, abolished the division effective July 1, 1978, and created in its stead the Department of Transportation Safety under the Secretary of Transportation. The purpose of the Department of Transportation Safety was to investigate, evaluate, and promote the safe movement of people and property in the transportation modes of highways, air, water, rail, and mass transit. The duties of the Highway Safety Commission were assumed by the Board of Transportation Safety, and the coordinating committee was replaced by a coordinating supervisor who served under the director of the department. The General Assembly passed an act on April 6, 1983, abolishing the department effective July 1, 1983, assigning its duties to the commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles, and creating a division of transportation safety under a deputy commissioner. The Board of Transportation Safety is currently within the Department of Motor Vehicles and advises the Governor, Secretary of Transportation, and the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles on transportation safety matters.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This series contains the administrative correspondence of the Commissioner for the Department of Transportation.  These records are also called Day Files by the Department.  The records consist of letters, memoranda, budgetary items and some reports involving substantive transportation issues such as road maintenance, construction and safety.
</p>

<p> The Commissioner's Correspondence also known as "Day Files" provides Commissioner Philip A. Shucet response to letters and e-mails (many transferred from the Governor's office) requesting assistance on topics involving transportation issues such as road construction, VDOT purchasing of property for right of way purposes and the impact of traffic congestion on the citizens of Virginia. Requests and questions of Secretary of Transportation Whittington Clement are among the correspondence transferred and handled by Commissioner Shucet's office.  Another feature of these records concerns the controversial proposed improvements to Interstate 81 offering much discussion concerning the impact on wildlife and the natural environment of the Shenandoah Valley. The records reflect citizen concerns about snow removal and or the lack of adequate cleaning of highways after snow storms are highlighted. The onslaught of traffic delays and subsequent delays due to road improvement construction are well documented in this collection. The inspection of bridges and budgetary discussions of ways to bring the cost down for the department are topics of interest.  This collection provides an index to all correspondence answered by the Commissioner's office. Some of the correspondence have attached reply letters sent out by the Commissioner's staff or Mr. Shucet. There is an index that provides the date, names, and topics of the various correspondence.  These records were microfilmed by the department before they were transferred to the library and each document has an assigned number displaying the order of filming.
