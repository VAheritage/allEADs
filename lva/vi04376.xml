<p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Business Records, both volumes and loose records, are in some cases transferred to the Library of Virginia as components of court record transfers. These business records in some cases were simply stored in the local court building for safe keeping by business owners. In other cases, business records (particularly ledgers, account books, etc.) may have been filed in a court case as an exhibit. These business record exhibits appeared both in chancery causes and in judgments, these records serving as exhibits for business dissolution cases, debut suits, and contract disputes.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Lee County was named Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee, governor of Virginia from 1791 to 1794.  It was formed from Russell County in 1792.  Part of Scott County was added in 1823.  Its area is 438 square miles, and the county seat is Jonesville.

Information found in each volume includes date of transaction, form of transaction, and amount owed and paid. The cash amount of transaction is listed under the name of ledger where it eventually was transferred. Ledgers listed include general ledger, petty ledger, cash ledger, payroll ledger, sales ledger, scrip ledger, store sales ledger, etc. Page numbers and account numbers found in many transactions correspond to page numbers and account numbers found in corresponding general ledgers. At the end of each month, the bookkeeper subtracted the cash received from cash paid to calculate the total balance for each ledger. The amount was then placed in the trial balance book and eventually transferred to the corresponding ledger. Loose papers (correspondence, receipts, etc.,) found in several ledgers were removed and placed in folder.
