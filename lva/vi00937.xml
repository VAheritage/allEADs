        <head>Processing Information
</head>
        <p>The Western State Hospital collection came to the Library of Virginia in multiple accessions over several decades.  In many cases, the original order of the material had been disturbed or was unidentifiable.  In other instances, the provenance was unclear and an educated guess was made as to which person or office created the records.  Care was taken to maintain the original order when possible, but for the most part, the arrangement of this collection is artificial.  The series names and groupings were devised by the processing archivist in an attempt to create logical divisions within this large collection.  Cross-references can be found in many series descriptions that will point the researcher to similar material in other series.
</p>
        <p>Additionally, separate box and volume numbering systems were imposed by the processing archivist for finding aid and stack location identification purposes.  The box and volume numbers should be used when requesting material, but are not always in strict numerical order.  
</p>
        <p>Researchers should also note that Series VI. of this finding aid describes correspondence, contracts, agreements, buildings and grounds records and other miscellaneous documents that were found during a records transfer at Eastern State Hospital in Williamsburg, Virginia in February 2010.  Many of the documents were created and used by building superintendent and architect Thomas R. Blackburn. According to records at Eastern State and Western State, these items were removed from the Western State Hospital archives in 1983 and used by researchers to accurately reconstruct the Public Hospital at Colonial Williamsburg.  The records were never returned to Western State and were eventually found in a basement at Eastern State in 1987.  The records were taken to the Eastern State archives where they were housed until the hospital transferred its historical records to the Library of Virginia in 2010.  The records in Series VI. remain part of Eastern State Hospital accession 44812. 
</p>
        <p>Accession 50989 came from the Commonwealth Center for Children and Adolescents, which was previously known as the DeJarnette State Sanatorium. Because of the overlap between these records and the records found in the Western State Hospital records, as well as the fact that Joseph DeJarnette was the superintendent of both facilities, these records have been interegrated into this collection as Series VII.</p>

      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>In January 1825 the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation providing for the construction of an asylum in the western part of the state.  A Court of Directors was commissioned by the Governor to serve as the asylum's governing body and charged with purchasing a site close to the town of Staunton, west of the Blue Ridge Mountains, on which to build an asylum to house the mentally ill of western Virginia.  The institution, which became known as Western Lunatic Asylum, was the second mental health facility built in the Commonwealth of Virginia.  The buildings and surrounding gardens were designed to embrace the idea of "moral therapy" for mentally ill patients by providing an aesthetically pleasing and tranquil atmosphere in which patients lived comfortably, exercised and worked outdoors.  </p>
      <p>Western Lunatic Asylum opened in 1828, accepting both male and female patients suffering from a variety of mental disorders.  Common diagnoses included "hard study," "religious excitement," and "debility of the nervous system."  The asylum was overseen by a Keeper, a Matron and a visiting physician during its earliest years.  The hospital also employed attendants, gate keepers, night watch personnel, farm hands, and a steward who handled the day-to-day financial operations. The first superintendent appointed to oversee Western Lunatic Asylum was Dr. Francis T. Stribling.  Dr. Stribling was a proponent of the moral therapy approach, and was a leader in the early mental health community.  Dr. Stribling was one of the thirteen founders of the Association of Medical Superintendents of American Institutions for the Insane, which later became known as the American Psychiatric Association.  Dr. Stribling served as the hospital superintendent and as a physician until his death in 1874.  </p>
      <p>It should be noted that the hospital underwent a short-lived name change between 1861 and 1865, when it was known as Central Lunatic Asylum.  (It should not be confused with an asylum of the same name later built in Petersburg, Virginia to house African American patients).  From 1865 to 1894 the name was again Western Lunatic Asylum.  However, in 1894 the General Assembly passed legislation changing the name to Western State Hospital.</p>
      <p>Another highly influential superintendent at Western State Hospital was Dr. Joseph S. DeJarnette.  Dr. DeJarnette was hired as a physician in 1889 and was appointed superintendent in 1905.  His tenure was the longest of any superintendent at Western State.  Dr. DeJarnette was also responsible for founding the DeJarnette State Sanatorium, which housed patients with the ability to pay for their treatment.  Dr. DeJarnette remained the superintendent of Western State for 38 years, retiring in 1943 with many accolades.  He served as superintendent of the sanatorium from its formation in 1932 to his full retirement in 1947.  Dr. DeJarnette's involvement in the eugenics movement and his support of the involuntary sterilization of mental patients has in more recent years earned him a less favorable reputation. </p>
      <p>Many of Western State Hospital's original structures remain standing on what is referred to as the "Old Site."  Many of these structures are historically and architecturally significant and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  During the 1960s a newer hospital facility was constructed, and over the next decade patients and programs were slowly moved to the "New Site."  Deinstitutionalization efforts and increased focus on localized community programs resulted in lower patient census numbers starting in the 1970s, and by the mid-1970s the Old Site had shut down completely.  The Old Site was later converted into Staunton Correctional Center, which it remained until its closure in late 2002.  The original grounds of Western State Hospital were eventually sold and are being converted into condominiums and retail space as part of an urban redevelopment plan. </p>
      <p>Western State Hospital continues to serve the mental health needs of Virginia's citizens from the New Site in Staunton, Virginia. The hospital is part of the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services (DBHDS) and is governed by the State Board of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The Western State Hospital collection contains a wide variety of bound volumes and paper records spanning more than 170 years (1825-1998). Included are administrative records such as annual reports, correspondence, office and subject files, meeting minutes, newsletters, photographs, and reports, as well as a specific departmental and program records relating to the Community Hospital Industrial Rehabilitation Program (CHIRP), the DeJarnette State Sanatorium, and the Shenandoah Geriatric Treatment Center (SGTC). Also included are financial records such as auditor's books, budget files, farm production records, and supply inventories. The patient-related records include admission registers, commitment papers, medical records, and several types of patient lists. Also included in this collection are a variety of report books created and maintained by staff members regarding patient admissions, attendants' rounds, ward activities, and many other duties performed at the hospital. The records of the Western State Hospital document many facets of the institution's operational history, patient life and medical treatment, as well as the evolution of mental health treatment in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

          <p>Contains a variety of records including annual and other miscellaneous reports, building and grounds records, correspondence, meeting minutes, newsletters, policies and procedures, photographs and slides, press material, subject/general files, and student papers and theses.  This series serves as a "catch-all" for records without a definite office of origin, but which shed light on various aspects of the administration of Western State Hospital.  Most of the records originated from or are thought to have been created and/or collected by the Superintendent (also known as the "Director") of the hospital. However, some records may have been created and collected by other departments or offices.  Though the provenance may be unclear in some cases, these records document the history of the institution and its various day-to-day activities. </p>

The reports often contain statistical and financial information for each institution under its governance, as well.  This state agency has changed names several times since its inception.  In the 1950s it was referred to as the Department of Mental Hygiene and Hospitals.  It became the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation in 1973, and then the Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services in 1987.</p>

              <p>Contains the annual reports of Western State Hospital that were submitted to the General Assembly by the Court or Board of Directors every year. Researchers should note that Western State Hospital has changed names several times during its history.  In its earliest years it was sometimes referred to as "Western Hospital," as well as the more commonly used, "Western Lunatic Asylum."  Between 1861 and 1865, it was known as Central Lunatic Asylum (not to be confused with the hospital of the same name later built in Petersburg, Virginia).  The name was eventually changed to Western State Hospital by an Act of the General Assembly in 1894. The reports were compiled by the superintendent and contain financial information, as well as patient-related statistics.  These charts often note specific mental conditions, place of patient origin, and if or when an elopement, discharge or death occurred. Other topics are addressed when necessary, and include discussions of medical techniques, equipment or employment needs, patient life, and overall management of the hospital. All of the earliest reports are handwritten, and some are merely rough drafts or notes.  Since this is not a comprehensive collection of annual reports, it may be necessary to look elsewhere for those that are missing.  In the earliest years, annual reports for state institutions were part of the rough journals of the House of Delegates (1826-1846).  Later, they became part of the Governor's message and annual reports of the public officers of the state (1847-1860s).  Annual reports for all of Virginia's state agencies (1860s and beyond) were bound together as "Annual Reports of Officers, Boards and Institutions of the Commonwealth of Virginia," (call no. JK3930.A21). Additional annual reports for Western Lunatic Asylum, most notably the report from 1861, can be found in the Records of Eastern State Hospital.</p>

            <p>Contains a variety of general files and meeting minutes created by and for the State Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services Board and all of its earlier incarnations.  The history of the Board begins with the Court of Directors which was established as soon as the General Assembly approved construction of the asylum in 1825.  In its earliest years, the directors met as frequently as necessary, sometimes several times each month.  In later years, the meetings became monthly or bi-monthly.  The Court of Directors was later renamed the Board of Directors, and its nine appointed members were required to meet on a quarterly basis.  In 1903, the Board of Directors was replaced by a three-person group called the Special Board of Directors.  This board answered to the newly-created General Board of Directors, which was composed of all the members of each hospital's Special Board.  The General Board connected all of the state-run hospitals for the first time.  In 1937 the individual Special Boards were abolished, and the General Board was renamed the State Hospital Board.  This board consisted of seven members who were responsible for the management of all the state-run hospitals.  This board was required to meet at least once each year at each hospital.  In later years, the Board met on a monthly or twice-monthly basis.  The State Hospital Board became the State Mental Health and Mental Retardation Board in 1973, and then the State Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services Board in 1987.  All Board records created prior to 1937 are specific to Western State Hospital, while those created after 1937 include information on all of the state-run hospitals.  For information on the Executive Committee (a subcommittee of the Western State Board of Directors), please see Series I. Administrative Records, Subseries G. Executive Committee Records, as well as Series I. Administrative Records, Subseries N. Reports.  The items within the Board of Directors general files were found loose within accessions 31030 and 41404. The meeting minutes are part of accessions 31353, 31704, and 41404.

Due to the presence of restricted patient information, these records may require review by an archivist and/or redaction (if it is possible) before they are served.</emph> Contains detailed minutes of the meetings of the Court of Directors, Board of Directors (also referred to as the "Directory"), and the Special Board of Directors of Western State Hospital.  Also included here are minutes of the meetings of the General Board of Directors, the State Hospital Board, the State Mental Health and Mental Retardation Board, and the State Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services Board, depending on the date of the document.  The minutes give insight into the decision-making processes and governance of Western State Hospital, as well as the other state hospitals.  A few of the early minute books have overlapping dates and many identical entries.  However, in some cases one book may have minutes that the other does not, so it would be beneficial to consult both for research purposes.  Some of the later loose minutes have agendas and correspondence attached.  Additionally, there are several hospital inspection reports included within the minutes for the 1940s. </p>

            <p>Contains office files and drawings pertaining to the hospital grounds, at both the New and Old Sites.  The office files document maintenance and upkeep, insurance matters, building dedications, and other issues pertaining to the Western State Hospital facility and campus. It is unclear which office or person created and maintained the files, but they may have originated in the Office of the Superintendent. Of particular note are the Fire Insurance Inspection Reports which give detailed accounts of the structures present at the Old Site in the 1960s.  The report includes information about the use of buildings, dates of construction, materials used, and value.  Each structure is detailed individually, most have a photograph attached as well.  Additional photographs of the buildings (exteriors and interiors) at the Old Site and New Site can be found in Series I. Administrative Records,  Subseries K. Photographs and Slides.  An older fireproofing report, including architectural renderings, can be found in this subseries under "Drawings and Plans."  Some of the older files include handwritten documents describing the hospital's gas works, water system, and construction projects (Box 18, Folders 3, 5, 19, 26).  Many of these documents were written by Thomas R. Blackburn, the building superintendent and former architectural student of Thomas Jefferson.  Researchers interested in the early years of Western State should also consult Series I. Administrative Records, Subseries D. Correspondence, (Box 19, Folder 2) which contains several documents relating to the construction of the original hospital buildings.  This file includes a rather detailed sketch of the early building and its dimensions drawn by Baltimore architect William Small.  There are also several letters from the hospital gardener, William Wood, that describe his work on the grounds of the hospital (Box 53, Folder 15).  Additional construction-related letters can be found in the 1890 correspondence file (Box 61, Folder 22).  Meeting minutes for the Local Building Committee and its later incarnation, the Institutional Executive Committee, can be found in Series I. Administrative Records, Subseries I. Meeting Minutes.  Additionally, an 1835 Building Committee report can be found in Series I. Administrative Records, Subseries N. Reports.  Researchers should also note additional buildings and grounds records (1825-1873), including a workbook belonging to building superintendent, Thomas Blackburn, can be found in Series VI. Records Found at Eastern State Hospital (Accession 44812).  

Most of the drawings and plans are of buildings located at the New Site, many of which were done by the architectural firm of Marcellus Wright and Son.  A few drawings of the Old Site are included, such as those of the proposed court yard area and canteen. The report on fireproofing includes an outdoor site plan and several architectural renderings of the wards.  The material found in this subseries was originally part of accessions 41404 and 31030.

            <p>Contains correspondence-related material including lists of correspondents, correspondence registers, postal and delivery records, general correspondence files, and the outgoing letter file of Dr. Joseph DeJarnette.  The outgoing letter file was separated from the general correspondence because it arrived as its own separate entity within the collection.  As a side note, lunacy and commitment papers that were originally housed with the correspondence can be found in Series IV. Patient Records, Subseries D. Commitment Records.  The earliest correspondence files are part of accession 31030, while some letters (mostly post-1900) are part of accession 41404.  The correspondence lists and registers, as well as Dr. DeJarnette's outgoing letters are part of accession 41404.

              <p>Contains lists of correspondents, most of whom wrote to inquire about specific patients.  It appears that the lists were most likely kept by the hospital superintendent.  The individual registers are arranged in loose alphabetical order and provide the correspondent's name, the name of the patient or "subject," the correspondent's address, and his or her relation to the patient.  All of the correspondent lists are undated, but the dates have been roughly estimated.  The first volume dates from sometime before 1874 because Dr. Francis Stribling's handwriting is found in it. The earliest list contains correspondents for both male and female patients.  The other four registers are divided according to the sex of the patient.  There are two lists devoted to correspondents inquiring about male patients and two lists for female patients.  Two of the registers have "Correspondence, W.S.H." stamped on the cover, along with "Male" or "Female."  They are believed to date from the late 1800s to the early 1900s.  The final two registers have no information on the cover and are thought to have been created and utilized during the 1910s to 1920s.  The four later registers contain loose correspondence and notes, which were used to formulate the approximate dates.  The last item listed is an unidentified and undated address book.  It is uncertain whether the contacts listed are related to patients.</p>

              <p><emph render="italic">Restricted: Correspondence containing patient names and information that is less than 125 years old.  These records may require review by an archivist and/or redaction (if it is possible) before they are served.</emph>  Contains correspondence files from the superintendent's office.  The correspondence has been divided into three subgroups: correspondence, subject correspondence, and surveys.  The largest of these groups is the general correspondence files which contain incoming letters addressed to the hospital superintendent.  The letters and surveys give insight into the daily work of the hospital superintendent and document the earliest years of Western State Hospital, and Virginia's mental health treatment system in general. Researchers should be be aware that some of the correspondence may contain mold due to past exposure to water. Although now stabilized, some spores may still be present.  As a result of the water damage, many of the documents are fragile and discolored, and must be handled with care. Researchers should also note that additional superintendent's correspondence (1835-1918) can be found in Series VI. Records Found at Eastern State Hospital (Accession 44812).  </p>

                <p>Contains mostly incoming letters addressed to the hospital superintendent.  Some draft copies of outgoing letters are also present and are filed according to the last name of the recipient. Several different types of letters are included in the correspondence.  For the most part, the material is in the form of letters from concerned friends and family members in regard to the conditions of specific patients. However, many of the letters in this subseries are in the form of patient applications from private citizens and jailors needing to place an insane person. In the earliest years of correspondence, the superintendent wrote "no vacancy" on the original request, if there was no room to house the patient.  Researchers may find some physician's reports about patients in the correspondence, since many were sent to the superintendent as letters.  The physicians would often answer the same questions found on the interrogatories in the commitment papers. Researchers should note that commitment papers can be found in Series IV. Patient Records, Subseries D. Commitment Papers. </p>
                <p>In some cases, the letters are written directly to the patient.  Letters sent to inmates from outsiders appear to have been screened by the superintendent.  He deemed whether the patient could have the letter or not, whether family members should continue writing, and whether patients could write back.  Notable letters include, James K. Dabney's letter to Governor James L. Kemper accusing the hospital of false imprisonment (Box 51, Folder 5), a letter from a man by the last name of Halyburton who wrote to his mother about rotten food served to patients (Box 51, Folder 10), and notes written by Thomas R. Evans to the hospital superintendent complaining of various problems and poor treatment (Box 51, Folder 6).  In other cases, former patients wrote to the superintendent, such as a man named John Jones of Hanover County, who accuses the hospital and its doctors, and many other organizations and people of grievious wrongdoing (Box 25, Folder 18), (Box 29, Folder 4) and (Box 30, Folder 18).

                <p>
There are many topics of particular historical interest featured in the correspondence files.  Information on building construction is featured sporadically throughout.  The 1825 folder contains several documents related to the construction of Western State, accompanied by a detailed sketch of the building and its dimensions (Box 19, Folder 2).  Additionally, the entire 1890 folder of correspondence revolves around the construction of a new building (Box 61, Folder 22).
</p>
                <p>
Also included are many letters are from various Virginia politicians, mostly members of the General Assembly or the Office of the Auditor of Public Accounts, which pertain to money issues and legislation affecting Western State Hospital.  Letters from the Auditor's office can be found interpersed throughout the folders from 1836, 1840, and 1841.  Letters from legislators and those interested in hospital affairs can be found in (Box 20, Folder 17), (Box 34, Folders 19-20), (Box 35, Folders 7-9), (Box 36, Folders 18-19), (Box 41, Folder 14), (Box 50, Folder 25) and (Box 51, Folders 1-2).  Letters from various Virginia governors such as Governor Westmoreland Davis (Box 62, Folder 7), Governor E. Lee Trinkle (Box 62, Folder 8 and Box 62, Folder 12), Governor Harry F. Byrd (Box 62, Folder 10; Box 62, Folder 11; Box 62, Folder 13; and Box 62, Folder 21), Governor George C. Peery (Box 62, Folder 20), as well as Governors James H. Price and Colgate W. Darden, Jr. (Box 62, Folder 21).  Many of the letters are thank-you notes or congratulatory in nature. Also included in the post-1900 correspondence is discussion of budgetary matters (Box 62, Folder 8).

                <p>
Correspondence during the Civil War years is sparse, but the volume greatly increases in the years following the war.  The letters from 1865-67 show the economic downturn many Virginians faced, and it appears that there was an increase in the number of letters of application.  Notable letters include those written by John R. Edmunds who wrote about the unsettled relations between the black and white populations (Box 43, Folder 4), and by a former slave named Harrison Kyle who wrote to the superintendent to inquire about the condition of his former owner (Box 43, Folder 12). A letter written by Dr. D. Lamatin from Howard's Grove Hospital in Richmond wrote to Dr. Francis Stribling for information that might help him establish a new hospital for blacks (Box 44, Folder 21).  That institution would later become known as Central State Hospital.  Also of note is a letter from Dr. Martin P. Scott who wrote seeking evidence to prove that emancipation caused an increase in African American insanity (Box 55, Folder 24).  For information on John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, please see letters written by James M. Hite (Box 38, Folder 9) and John Q. Marr (Box 38, Folder 17).  In the letters Hite discusses the incident in terms of government response, while Marr wrote about the public's response, both white and black.
</p>
                <p>
Another topic of interest is the correspondence between the superintendents of Western Lunatic Asylum and Eastern Lunatic Asylum in Williamsburg.  Robert M. Garrett, a former superintendent of Eastern State wrote to Dr. Stribling about his ouster from office and illegal actions taken by the Board of Directors (Box 43, Folder 7).  In another letter, Dr. C.S. Mills describes the suicide death of Garrett's successor, Dr. Peticolas (Box 43, Folder 14). In a letter to Dr. Stribling written by Dr. D.R. Brower of Eastern, it is revealed that many of the "books and most of the record of the asylum [Eastern State Hospital] had been scattered to the four winds," (Box 44, Folder 8). Additionally, the folder of 1892 correspondence contains letters between Eastern and Western administrators that touch on unhappy employees, fees, and the presence of inebriates at the hospitals (Box 61, Folder 23).  
</p>
                <p>
There are several unexplained gaps within the superintendent's correspondence.  In some cases, the gaps are alphabetical, in others the gaps are chronological. Generally, the quantity of letters diminishes after 1879.  The correspondence after 1900 focuses less on patients and family members, and more on business practices, policies and budgetary matters.  The correspondence is arranged chronologically by year, then alphabetically within.  However, there is no order within the folder(s) associated with a particular letter of the alphabet.  Letters with illegible or missing names are filed in the last folder of the year in which they were written.  Researchers should note that additional correspondence files dating from 1907 to 1944 are located separately from the general superintendent's correspondence, but also in this subseries, under the heading of Superintendent's Correspondence Files: Dr. Joseph S. DeJarnette.

                <p>Contains several files of superintendent's correspondence that were previously arranged apart from the general correspondence.  Included here are letters to Dr. Francis Stribling from social reformer Dorothea Dix.  Dix was well-known as a crusader on behalf of the indigent insane.  Her letters detail her travels and experiences at other hospitals.  The correspondence begins in the 1840s and ends in the 1870s.  Researchers should note that the Stribling letters to Dix are located at Houghton Library at Harvard University. Also included are folders of correspondence regarding the relationship between the Eastern and Western hospitals.  In these letters Dr. Stribling of Western Lunatic Asylum and Dr. Galt of Eastern Lunatic Asylum discuss problems between the institutions, most notably the dispute over the geographical lines which guided admissions. The case of Alfred Mather became the turning point in this dispute.  The subject correspondence also contains a folder devoted to an 1844 incident involving the inhumane treatmeant and illegal transport of a patient named William Hudson from Nelson County to Western State Hospital, as well as one folder of letters written by V.M. Randolph detailing his supposed mistreatment while a patient at the hospital.</p>

                <p>The survey material contains questionnaires received in response to a circular sent by Dr. Francis T. Stribling asking all Virginia doctors to take a census of the insane patients in their jurisdictions.  The doctor's purpose was to complete a roster of all insane persons in Virginia not currently being treated at an asylum.  The purpose for this project is unclear, but it appears that Dr. Stribling may have been trying to gather information for a report that would highlight the need for larger and more numerous mental health institutions in Virginia.  Many of these files also contain lists of physicians practicing in each locality.  It appears that Dr. Stribling may have died prior to the completion of this project.

These records may require review by an archivist and/or redaction (if it is possible) before they are served.</emph>  Contains two groups of correspondence belonging to hospital superintendent Dr. Joseph S. DeJarnette which were maintained separately from the other correspondence files, and separately from each other.  The first group contains only outgoing letters dating from 1907 and 1909, while the other set contains both incoming and outgoing letters written between 1910 and 1944.  Reseachers should note that a small amount of additional work-related DeJarnette correspondence can be found in the later years of the previous section of Superintendent's Correspondence. Dr. DeJarnette's personal correspondence and other effects can be found in Series I., Subseries E. DeJarnette Personal Files. </p>

                <p>Contains correspondence dating from the years shortly after Dr. Joseph S. DeJarnette's 1906 appointment as Superintendent of Western State Hospital. These letters are mostly small, brittle scraps of paper which are very difficult to read due to faded ink.  Preservation photocopies were made, but in many instances, the letters are still unreadable.  The letters are addressed to patients' families and various suppliers.  Due to their small size, the letters are not highly detailed.  Thus, the photocopied pages feature several letters on each page, in no particular order. </p>

These records may require review by an archivist and/or redaction (if it is possible) before they are served.</emph> Contains both incoming and outgoing letters written to and from Dr. Joseph S. DeJarnette, superintendent of Western State Hospital and later, DeJarnette State Sanatorium.  The incoming letters are mostly inquiries from family and friends of patients.  The outgoing letters were sometimes typed on the backs of the incoming letters.  This correspondence is much more detailed and in much better physical condition than the earlier material.  Each paper folder within a larger folder contains letters pertaining to a particular patient.  Some of the patients featured in these letters may have resided at DeJarnette Sanatorium as well as Western State Hospital, since Dr. DeJarnette was superintendent of both simultaneously from 1932-1943, and head of the sanatorium from 1943-1947. </p>

            <p>Contains account books, correspondence, personal files, and scrapbooks belonging to longtime hospital superintendent, Dr. Joseph S. DeJarnette and his wife Dr. Chertsey Hopkins DeJarnette.  Dr. DeJarnette began as a physician at the hospital in 1889 and became superintendent in 1905.  He was responsible for the planning and implementation of what would be called the DeJarnette State Sanatorium, constructed in 1932 to house patients who could afford to pay for their treatment.  Dr. DeJarnette held the superintendency of both institutions until 1943 when he resigned as superindent of Western State.  He remained the superintendent of the Sanatorium until 1947.  Dr. DeJarnette was also an important figure in the eugenics and sterilization movements in Virginia.  Additionally, Dr. Chertsey Hopkins DeJarnette is thought to have been one of the first licensed female psychiatrists in Virginia, having served as a physician at Western State from 1894-1906.  
</p>
            <p>The account books are not clearly identified, but they seem to be personal in nature.  Most of the volumes contain records of stocks and dividends, as well as the estate of Mrs. DeJarnette's sister, Nannette Hopkins.  The correspondence files contain letters to and from Dr. DeJarnette in relation to personal matters to include topics such as the hospital, poetry, and state government issues.  Much of the later correspondence deals with Dr. DeJarnette's transition as head of DeJarnette Sanatorium, and problems encountered by a would-be reformer by the name of Reverend W. Carroll Brooke.  Several folders of correspondence belonging to Dr. DeJarnette's wife Chertsey are also included, as well as material pertaining to her younger sister Orra Hopkins.  The personal files contain mostly insurance documents and financial records.  The folders labeled "Scrapbook" contain material found in three scrapbooks presumably put together by recent Western State Hospital staff.  It is not known whether the material was originally in scrapbook form, or if the placement in binders was done arbitrarily at a later date.  The first scrapbook contains letters of congratulation upon Dr. DeJarnette's fiftieth anniversary with Western State Hospital in 1939.  Also included are invitations, telegrams and newspaper clippings.  The second book contains miscellaneous ephemera such as birthday, Christmas, and anniversary greeting cards, letters, and poetry.  The third contains mostly poetry, some written by Dr. DeJarnette himself, others from newspaper clippings, and some that was sent to him by mail.  The scrapbook material was removed from the binders for preservation purposes. 
</p>
            <p>It is unclear why this personal material was maintained and included as part of the Western State Hospital collection.  However, much of the material relates directly to the hospital and Dr. DeJarnette's tenure as superintendent.  It also provides a personal glimpse into a revered and controversial figure in Western State's history.  Additional work-related DeJarnette correspondence can be found in the previous correspondence sections within this series. These personal files are part of accessions 41404 and 45553.

            <p>Contains ledgers and other material pertaining to employment and personnel activities. The absence ledger contains lists of male ward employees and what seem to be requests for days off from work.  The Registration Books also document employee absences.   The Employees Handbook contains helpful information for new employees.  It covers pay, leave, retirement, and health insurance information, and provides descriptions of the duties performed by each department of the hospital.  The Time Books contains monthly accounts of work attendance by each ward's regular attendants.  This book accounts for male ward employees only.  The three later volumes contain what appear to be monthly accounts of work attendance by those employed in the business office.  The Weekend Book contains several miscellaneous sections of notes and short entries about weekend personnel activities, followed by a list of nurse supervising duties and a list of representative meetings.  The telephone directories contain at-work contact information for employees of Western State, as well as numbers for general and designated work areas.  The records in this series are part of accession 41404. </p>

            <p>Contains subject and miscellanous files found throughout the Western State Hosptial collection.  The files consist of a variety of material including limited correspondence, memos, working papers, and other related documents pertaining to a particular subject or person.  The files were most likely maintained by the hospital superintendent or his office staff, but in some cases the origin is unknown.  Many files contain only one document, while other subjects fill several folders.  The title of "General Files" was given in order to encompass all of the subject files, as well as lone and/or miscellaenous documents found in the collection. These files are part of accessions 31030, 31353, 31704, and 41404.

              <p>Contains miscellaneous files and individual documents found in various parts of the Western State Hospital collection.  Much of the earlier material was found mixed in with the superintendent's correspondence.  Topics of note include the 1883 patient poisonings and the subsequent investigation performed by the Pinkerton company, the handwritten job descriptions, including those for the ten pin alley attendant, the night nurse, and the steward, as well as the files of legal documents that include wills, estate settlements, and summonses.  Researchers should note that additional 19th century files (1828-1873) can be found in Series VI. Records Found at Eastern State Hospital (Accesion 44812). </p>

The minutes contain information about administrative and medical activities at the hospital.  Some minutes are highly detailed, while others contain just an outline of subjects discussed.  Most of the minutes were originally part of the Director's Correspondence and Reference Files accession, but were arranged separately for ease of research.  In other cases, minutes were found scattered throughout the collection and moved to this subseries for the same reason.  The bulk of the minutes date from the 1960s and 1970s.  Meeting minutes from a variety of hospital committees can also be found in Series II. Departmental and Program Records, Subseries C. Shenandoah Geriatric Treatment Center Files.  Researchers should check each section of this subseries for the minutes of specific committees.  The meeting minutes are part of accessions 31353, 31704, and 41404.

              <p>Contains the meeting minutes of the Infection Control Committee.  This committee was composed of physicians at Western State Hospital as well as outside public health officials.  When the committee first formed, it also included members from the Augusta-Staunton Health Department, King's Daughters' Hospital, and the University of Virginia, School of Medicine.  The minutes include statistics on the number of infections in the various wards, the types of infections present, and the treatments utilized.  It appears that the records were kept in order to satisfy state laws that required reporting the presence of infectious diseases in public hospitals.</p>

              <p>Contains meeting minutes for the Local Building Committee.  The Local Building Committee was previously called the "Building Committee."  During the 1970s the name and some of the duties were changed, and the commmittee became the "Institutional Executive Committee."  The minutes were separated in an attempt to retain the original order of the records. Much of the Local Building Committee material focuses on the construction of the "New Site," and includes rough plans, bidding information, and cost analyses.  Also included is correspondence between the hospital and the architectural firm of Marcellus Wright and Son of Richmond, Virginia.  Information on other small building and maintenance projects can be found here as well.  For more information on buildings and grounds subjects, please see Series I. Administrative Records, Subseries C. Building, Facilities and Grounds Records, as well as the minutes of the Institutional Executive Committee.  </p>

              <p>Contains meeting minutes for several unit meetings within the Western State Hospital geriatric program.  The minutes contain information about events, treatment, and patient well-being.  Some of the minutes date from the time before Shenandoah Geriatric Treatment Center was officially established, but still pertain solely to the geriatric program.  The minutes are from specific unit meetings, as well as meetings of all the units within the center.  These minutes are separate from the other Shenandoah Geriatric Treatment Center files because they were found in the files of the hospital superintendent.  For more information on the geriatric program please see the "Geriatric Program" files within Series I. Administrative Records, Subseries H. General Files and Ledgers, 20th Century.  Additional information on Shenandoah Geriatric Treatment Center can be found in Series II. Departmental and Program Records, Subseries C. Shenandoah Geriatric Treatment Center Files.</p>

              <p>Contains meeting minutes of the Utilization Review Committee.  This group began as the Medical Records Committee, later became the Medical Records and Utilization Review Committee, then finally shortened the title to Utilization Review Committee.   Utilization reviews were conducted in accordance with Title XVIII of Public Law 89-97 and the standards set forth by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals.  The committee reviewed patient medical records to ensure that high quality care was provided, and that hospital facilities and services were being used effectively.  The committee members included the Director of Medical Services and four staff physicians.  A detailed description of the committee and its goals can be found in the folder labeled 1966-1967.  </p>

              <p>Contains minutes and other administrative material pertaining to the Western State Hospital Association of Registered Nurses.  The first folder contains the association's philosophy and basic constitution, but the by-laws are missing despite the presence of a table of contents. The subsequent folders each contain memos, meeting minutes, letters and other miscellaneous items.  The memos and minutes show the progression of an organization struggling with attendance, as well as the grievances expressed by the nursing staff about issues such as staff shortages.  </p>

            <p>Contains newsletters created by and for Western State Hospital employees, and to some extent, the patients as well.  The newsletters contain information about hospital policies, activities, and governmental legislation.  They also contain photographs of employee activities and events, notations about births, weddings, illnesses, new-hires, retirements, employee service recognitions and other pertinent information.  Most of the newsletters include an introduction by the hospital director.  The earliest newsletters also contain individual ward reports which document the activities and movements of patients. The newsletter underwent several name, format and publication changes over the years.  The earliest newsletter was called "Who's and What's," (1940) and the next earliest newsletters were called "Valley Echoes," (1955-1966).  The next name change occurred sometime after 1966, when the newsletter became the "Western State Hospital Bulletin."  In 1974, the title was changed to the "Western State Monthly Messenger."  Finally, the newsletter became "The Messenger" in 1979.  Also included in this subseries are three newsletters printed in addition to the the series that became "The Messenger."  These extras include the "Personnel Bulletin," which was issued periodically during the 1950s and 1960s, and the "Security Dispatch" and "Western Update," which were printed in the 1990s.  The newsletters are part of accession 41404.

Many loose photographs accompanied the albums, but no attempt was made to integrate them back into the albums.  The loose photographs have been arranged chronologically by date after the albums.  Many of the albums have similar titles and overlapping dates.  The photographs were removed from their original housings for preservation purposes, but each album's contents have been kept together.  The photos within each album have been foldered separately by year due to the privacy restrictions placed upon them. </p>

These photographs will be withheld from research for 75 years from the date of creation.  </emph>  Contains photographs and prints that document the hospital grounds, construction projects, and activities. The photographs are divided up into the following five groups: construction photographs, event and activity images, exterior photographs, interior images, and photographs of people.  Most of the photographs were not originally labeled or grouped together, thus the categories were created for ease of research.  The portraits reprinted on photograph paper date from the 1820s, and there are a few photographs from the late 1800s, but the majority of the photographs in this collection are from the 1950s.  The 1950s black and white photos are dispersed throughout the categories, but account for most of the images in the "Construction," "Interior," and "Exterior" categories.  Many of these photographs document renovation of the Old Site, and the construction of buildings at the New Site.  The exterior and interior photographs document structures on the Western State campus, often also providing "before" and "after" images.  The photographs in the "Event/Activity" files document anniversary celebrations, holiday parties, staff retirements, and staff performing various job duties.  The "People" files contain group and individual staff photographs spanning several decades, as well as photographs of hospital superintendents Dr. Joseph S. DeJarnette and Dr. Lyn Harding, the members of the General Board of State Hospitals, and the Association of Medical Superintendents of American Institutions for the Insane.  Unfortunately, a number of the photographs in this group are unidentified and/or undated.  Some of the later photographs were accompanied by negatives, and a group of loose negatives can be found at the end of the list. </p>

Please see the restriction sheets inside the slide boxes for more specific information on restricted slides.  </emph>  Contains slides which document various patient activities, festivals, hospital programs, and staff presentations.  Some slides contain images of buildings and grounds, "before and after" shots, as well as what appear to be slide presentations on topics such as obsessive compulsive disorder and alcoholism.  There are also slides used for instructional purposes that include several graphic images of patient injuries, though patient identities are not revealed.  The slides titled "Miscellaneous Slides (Activities, Buildings, Older WSH Images circa 1930s-1950s" (boxes 116e-f) contain several slides of older images that document the hospital buildings and grounds.  Many of these slides can be found in photograph form in the preceeding section, but others are only found in slide form.   Most of the slides were originally housed in binders, but carried little or no identifying information.  The binders were arranged in arbitrary order by the archivist and given labels I through VIII.  The contents of each binder are separated by green tabs.  Groups of identifiable slides within a volume are separated by a beige tab that contains the descriptive information as it was provided in the material.  Some categories may appear more than once, and the groups are not in chronological order. </p>

            <p>Contains various procedural documents published by the state agency that governed Western State Hospital, as well as several internal policy documents drafted by the hospital itself.  The oldest material can be found in the "Regulations and Orders" ledger.  Here, the duties and expectations of each employee are transcribed by the superintendent.  The ledger contains very specific details about Western State Hospital's earliest workers.  The modern manuals were updated frequently, so many of them contain memos and other documents noting changes to the rules and regulations.  The manuals provide insight into the daily routines of Western State employees and patients including diet planning, infection control, and administrative practices.  The most informative manuals are those that document specific departmental and hospital instructions, ranging from laundry sanitation to energy conservation.  The policies and procedures material is part of accession 31704, 41404, and 50576.

              <p>Contains newspaper clippings that document the institution and its directors, legislative decisions affecting the hospital, volunteer activities, and the subject of mental health.  The clippings were originally pasted or taped to paper, and arranged chronologically in several three-ring binders.  Many of the binders had overlapping dates, and in some cases, there were multiple binders for only one year.  No attempt to merge the clippings was made, thus they remain together as they had in the individual binders.  The clippings were photocopied for preservation purposes.  A notable set of clippings titled "Crossfire at the Crossroads" taken from The Daily Progress in Charlottesville, Virginia (Box 122, Folder 1).  This series of articles describes the need for better facilities, professional training, and a more progressive attitude toward mental health treatment in general.  Other topics of interest include the conversion of the "Old Site" into a correctional facility, (Box 124, Folders 6 and 8), and the resignation of superintendent Dr. Hobart G. Hansen,(Box 124, Folder 8).</p>

Due to deteriorating adhesive and acidic paper, some of the scrapbooks were dismantled and contents photocopied. </p>

Sometimes the report also notes when they were discharged or when they died, and also whether their estate was able to pay for their expenses. The reports of the keeper are divided into two categories, "contracts" and "patients." </p>

The superintendent was required to report regularly to both the Executive Committee and the Court of Directors/Board of Directors.  The earliest physician/superintendent's reports contain detailed commentary in regard to specific issues, projects, and petitions.  These reports also often feature tables displaying patient-related statistics.  Much of the information is financial, but many of the reports also include detailed accounts of hospital life.  The later reports contain similar information, but were submitted on a regular monthly and quarterly basis.  The reports included here are rough drafts, but the final reports of the physician/superintendent were usually published in the annual reports of the institution, many of which can be found in Series I. Administrative Records, Subseries A. Annual Reports.</p>

              <p>Contains a variety of reports, mostly published by the the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation or another branch of state government.  One notable report is the Virginia Comprehensive Mental Health Services Plan (Fiscal Years 1976-1981), which is a projection plan with annual updates on progress.  Also included is hospital superintendent Dr. Benjamin Blackford's address to the Committee on Public Institutions of the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1902, during which he made his case for keeping the state hospitals under local governance.  Despite Dr. Blackford's plea, the legislature voted to centralize the hospital system.</p>

            <p>Contains two types of mental health related publications.  The first is a historical sketch about the origins of Central State Hospital and the care of the "colored insane" in Virginia from 1870 to 1905.  The sketch was written by William F. Drewry, M.D., superintendent of the hospital.  The booklet includes photographs (mostly of buildings) and a very detailed account of the hospital's creation and development and gives limited information about the care of African American patients.  Also included here are several issues of the "Mental Hygiene Survey" published by the Virginia State Hospital Board in 1940s.  This serial was published monthly and included editorials, articles and other news about the state hosptials and colonies.  Its primary objective was to "disseminate news and educational matter looking to improvement of the State Hospital System...and to advance Mental Health in general."

Some records may require review by an archivist and/or redaction (if it is possible) before they are served.  </emph>  Contains a variety of records most likely created and maintained by director of the Community Hospital Industrial Rehabilitation Program (CHIRP) at Western State Hospital.  The program began operating during the 1960s, and along with the Work Therapy Division, were administered by the Work Programs Department beginning in early 1968.  CHIRP began with the goal of giving patients a place to work that would be similar to working conditions in their home communities.  The program also gave patients the opportunity to learn acceptable work habits, to socialize with other people, and to earn money.  Patients were evaluated, interviewed, and assigned suitable jobs based on their level of skill.  Most of the work was piece-work, and done for various local and national companies.  Some work was conducted off-site at local farms or other places of employment. This subseries contains files on various companies for which CHIRP provided services, correspondence, meeting minutes, and reports compiled by the Work Programs Department.  Several files are devoted to orders for birdhouses and feeders, for which the CHIRP program was well-known locally for producing.  The CHIRP records are part of accession 41283.  </p>

            <p>Contains annual reports, brochures, and purchasing records of the DeJarnette State Sanatorium.  The sanatorium was established as DeJarnette Sanatorium in 1932 by Western State Hospital superintendent Dr. Joseph S. DeJarnette.  It functioned as a unit for voluntary patients with the financial means to pay for treatment.  The sanatorium was a self-supporting institution, deriving its funds from patient payments instead of the state treasury.  Dr. DeJarnette oversaw the operations of both Western State and DeJarnette Sanatorium until he resigned his position at the hospital and became the head of only the sanatorium in 1943.  Dr. DeJarnette remained superintendent of the sanatorium until 1947, one year after the institution formally separated itself from Western State Hospital and began calling itself DeJarnette State Sanatorium.  Researchers should note that correspondence regarding patients who resided at the sanatorium might be found in Series I. Administrative Records, Subseries D. Correspondence, Superintendent's Correspondence: Dr. J.S. DeJarnette.  The DeJarnette State Sanatorium records are part of accession 41404.

Some records may require review by an archivist and/or redaction (if it is possible) before they are served.  </emph>  Contains files correspondence, reports, and reference files created and utilized by the Director of the Shenandoah Geriatric Treatment Center (SGTC), a semi-autonomous unit of Western State Hospital.  The files include information on the specialized treatment of geriatric patients, the Intermediate Care Facility and Intensive Psychiatric Treatment certification processes, and the possible separation of SGTC from Western State Hospital.  The files arrived in two separate accessions, comprised of five date-based subgroups: 1974-1978, 1978, 1979, 1981, and 1982.  There is considerable overlap in dates and subject matter between the groups, so researchers should examine all of the subgroups for information on a particular person or topic. In order to better understand the files, it is necessary to provide background information on the leadership of Shenandoah Geriatric Treatment Center (SGTC).  Personnel changes were frequent during the years these files were kept, and job titles changed often as well.  The records indicate that Lyn Harding served as Acting Director of SGTC from 1976-77, and then held the dual role of Assistant Director of SGTC and Assistant Director of Geriatric Services from 1977-1978.  Later in 1978, Harding left Geriatric Services to become Associate Director, Administrative for Western State Hospital.  As a result of Harding's departure, Paul Hundley, Director of Geriatric Psychological Services was named Acting Director of SGTC in 1979.  Later in 1979, Phil Denton took over the dual roles Director of SGTC and Assistant Director, Geriatric Services, which he held until 1981.  Early in 1981, Director Phil Denton resigned and Paul Hundley, Director of Geriatric Psychological Services, again became Acting Director.  Hundley returned to his old position when Charles Spraker was appointed as Denton's permanent replacement in October 1981, and was still serving in this capacity in 1982.  The Shenandoah Geriatric Treatment Center records are part of accessions 31704 and 32451.

          <p>Contains a variety of financial records including those related to accounting, budgeting, farm and sewing production, sales, and procurement of supplies. This series also contains the records of the auditor and the steward, two important positions within the hierarchy of Western State Hospital.  The auditor (often also the superintendent) controlled the allocation and spending of hospital funds and reported to the Board of Directors. The steward served as the superintendent's assistant in the administration of business and financial affairs. The steward was responsible for maintaining accurate day-to-day financial records.  The records in this series document various aspects of the finanical history of Western State Hospital.  The original order and grouping of these volumes is unclear, but an attempt was made to keep similar records together under headings stamped on the books, however some categories were created by the archivist due to the absence of any identifying information.  In many cases there are gaps in time and sequence that cannot be explained. </p>

Due to the presence of restricted patient information, this volume will require review by an archivist until the records reach 125 years of age.  </emph>  Contains financial information about patients paying for treatment at Western State Hospital.  Many patients were admitted as "state patients," meaning that they were unable to afford the cost of their hospital stays.  Those who could pay their own way were charged based upon their ability to pay.  These account books contain information about patient committees and guardians, lists of payments and deposits, as well as lists of those accounts forwarded to an attorney for collection.  One separate undated index is present, but it is unclear to which ledger it belongs. Gaps in time are unexplained, as are overlapping dates. The accounts for board are part of accession 41404.  </p>

            <p>Contains reports of Western State Hospital's finances, as compiled by the auditor.  The auditor controlled the general allocation and spending of hospital funds and reported to the Board of Directors at specific intervals.  The first two auditor's books found here are very similar and can be linked chronologically.  The reports housed in these volumes are divided into categories with titles such as "support," "board," and "buildings."  Expenditures within each category are described.  The additional five volumes are not in running chronological order, but also contain monthly expense reports divided into broad categories.  These categories include expenditures related to salaries, lights, steam, laundry, and farm activities.  Although it is not entirely clear that these last five volumes are actually auditor's books, the information contained in them is similar enough to warrant their inclusion here. The records of the Auditor are part of accession 41404.

            <p>Contains a variety of budgetary documents including information on appropriations, expenditures and other state budget preparation material.  The biennium budget for 1966-1968 is the focal point of much of the material.  Included are mostly working papers and drafts of budgets and proposals submitted to the General Assembly. Additionally, one notable folder contains a 1927 letter from Governor Harry F. Byrd which discussed the need for all Virginia agencies to cut costs.  Included in this folder is a study on consolidation and simplification of state government (Box 208, Folder 14).  A Western State Hospital budget exhibit for 1970-1972 is located in Series II. Departmental and Program Records, Subseries A. Community Hospital Industrial Rehabilitation Program (CHIRP) Files, (Box 144, Folders 4-5).  A 1982-1984 program exhibit for Western State is located in Series II. Departmental and Program Records, Subseries C. Shenandoah Geriatric Treatment Center (SGTC) Files, (Box 201, Folder 9). The budget records are part of accession 41404.

            <p>Contains a wide variety of financial ledgers including account, cash, invoice, purchasing, receipt and wage payment books that document the cash flow at Western State Hospital.  The ledgers document supply purchases made and often include information about what was purchased, from whom it was purchased, and the cost.  Some of the volumes document the purchase of one particular item, such as coal or meat, while some reflect expenditures out of a particular account. Many of the ledgers in this subseries are missing bindings and other identifying information.  The "Account Book (Miscellaneous)" category contains various order, purchasing, and general expenditure records which do not run in neat chronological order and may or may not be related to each other.  Most of the accounting was handled by the steward, though these volumes could not be directly attributed to that position.  Researchers may also benefit from reviewing the records of the Steward found in Subseries K. Steward's Records.  The expenditure and purchasing records are part of accession 41404.

            <p>Contains accounting ledgers with information about Western State Hospital's general expense fund and its contingency fund.  It is unclear whether the "contingent fund" and the "patient contingent fund" were separate accounts or one and the same. The money in the contingent account may have been patients' private funds.  Journals accompany each ledger and contain daily or transactional accounts of money received and expended.  The ledgers only contain final tabulations, often on a monthly basis.  The ledgers and journals may have been kept by the Steward, since he controlled the hospital's day-to-day spending, and possibly the patients' private accounts as well. These volumes were separated from the other records of the Steward because of their unique labeling and the presence of separate journals.  Gaps in time and alphabetical order remain unexplained.  Researchers should review Subseries D. Expenditure and Purchasing Records, as well as Subseries K. Steward's Records for additional information. Those interested in private patient accounts should consult Subseries H. Patient Account Records. Additionally, two other volumes with similar labeling exist: "Ledger C" is a wage book located in Subseries D. Expenditure and Purchasing Records, "Ledger D, Contingent Account," which is located in Subseries H. Patient Account Records, and "Ledger E," which is an account book also located in Subseries D. Expenditure and Purchasing Records.  It is unclear whether these volumes are part of the same alphabetical series as the ledgers found here. The general ledgers and journals are part of accession 41404.

            <p>Contains several ledgers and one folder of records that document how funds belonging to individual patients were handled.  It appears that money was deposited by family members into accounts in order for patients to buy items not covered by the basic room and board provided by the hospital.  Some patients also performed work for the hospital and were reimbursed through this method as well. The patient account ledgers are divided into three categories: account books, cash books (monies disbursed), and day books (monies received). Incoming funds were entered into the day books, outgoing funds were recorded in the cash books, and the account books contain both sets of information, arranged by patient name.  Many of the account books contain indices because the entries are not usually arranged in alphabetical order.  The second column of each transaction in the cash books contains the page number for the corresponding account book entry for that particular patient.  One book of receipts for money paid to patient accounts through salaries or deposit by family members is also included in this suberies.  Finally, amongst the ledgers is one file containing an annual report of patients' private funds for the years 1956-1957.  Several of the volumes in this subseries refer to the "Patients' Contingent Account" or the "Contingent Fund." Researchers interested in patient funds and accounts information should also reference Subseries F. General Ledgers and Journals. Additionally, one ledger containing limited patient fund information for 1851-1853 can be found in Subseries K. Steward's Records, (Volume 201).  The patient account records are part of accession 41404.

            <p>Contains account books for several independent monetary funds set up to aid Western State Hospital patients.  Most of the funds were set up by friends and family of current of former patients, with the money designated to pay for what were deemed "special comforts."  These funds include the Murkland Fund, the Arlette McGiverin Fund, the Nathan H. Marshall Fund, and the Sallie V. and Elvira E. Chapman Fund.  The origin of the Chapel Society is unclear, but its membership may have come from the hospital population, with the superintendent serving as treasurer.  The last ledger contains receipts and disbursements for both the patient and special funds, but also the Commonwealth Fund which provided assistance to many rural hospitals.  Several of the ledgers contain background information about the individual funds, sometimes in the form of correspondence.  The special funds records are part of accession 41404.

            <p>Contains ledgers directly linked to the steward of Western State Hospital.  The steward served as the superintendent's assistant in the administration of business and financial affairs. The steward was responsible for maintaining accurate financial records of money expended from both the "support account" and the "contingent account."  Expenditures such as those for food, transportation, wages and general patient care can be found in the account books (later called Day Books).  Also included in this subseries is a ledger containing financial reports created by the Steward for examination by the superintendent, the Board of Directors, the Auditor of Public Accounts, and the Executive Committee. A notebook containing various entries regarding supplies, contact information and charts can be found here, as well as a register of letters written by the steward, and a book containing sales records.  Additional sales records can be found in Subseries I. Sales Books. Researchers should also examine Subseries H. Patient Account Records, Subseries F. General Ledgers and Journals, and Subseries D. Expenditures and Purchasing Records for more information on hospital finances and other financial records that may or may not have been handled by the steward. The steward's records are part of accession 41404.

Please see reference staff if you wish to view a register that has a date range that encompasses both unrestricted and restricted content.  </emph>  Contains registers of patients admitted to Western State Hospital that list patients admitted during a specific period of time.  Every patient was assigned an identification number when admitted to the hospital.  Some patients may have multiple numbers due to multiple admissions over time. The admission numbers for each ledger are found in parentheses in the content listing.  Each entry contains information about the patient including his or her name, number of previous admissions, occupation, admission date, sex, age, social relation, education, nativity, residence, number of attacks, duration of the disease upon admission, supposed cause of disease, form of disease upon admission, removal date, condition upon removal, mode of removal, and various remarks.  The remarks also include information pertaining to family history of insanity and cause of death. One volume contains only female names (1852-1916).  There are also two admission register indices, which are loosely arranged alphabetically.  Researchers should know that the annual and biennial lists (found later in this series) contain much of the same information found in the admission registers, but in most cases the annual and biennial lists are ordered according to the date of admission, not the admission number. For additional information on admissions, researchers should also see Series V. Report Books and Other Registers, Subseries A. Admission Report Books.  It should be noted that these ledgers record the initial intake of each patient, but contain much less information than the admission registers.  The admission records are part of accessions 41253 and 41404.

            <p>Contains volumes featuring detailed accounts of individual patients and their treatment at Western State Hospital.  The accounts include references to the patient's health, medications and activities.  If a patient was new to the hospital, the account usually included admission information and medical history as well.  The case books each start during a particular year and were added to at sporadic intervals until the book became full and another volume was started.  The date spans given to the volumes are "bulk dates."  There are instances when an entry was added that was outside the official date span of the volume, usually only by a year or two.  In some cases, the doctor ran out of room and continued a patient's account in the next volume, usually with a note as to page number.   In the early 20th century volumes, each page has a standardized form for recording patient information.  The form contains room for the patient's name, date of admission, nativity, residence, age, type of insanity, symptoms, pulse rate, height and weight, deformities, condition of teeth, sight, reflexes and heart.  Underneath the form there is room for chronological recordkeeping.  The most recent volumes are referred to as "clinical records," but contain the same type of information in the same form, and as a result they are included here under the original title of "case books."  To get the most accurate information, researchers should consult the index of each volume when attempting to locate a particular patient. Some volumes have a separate index booklet, while others have an internal index. The significance of the case book numbering system is unknown, but in some instances there are multiple volumes associated with one case book number. Researchers should note that additional miscellaneous patient medical records can be found in Subseries G. Medical Records.  The case books are part of accession 41404.

              <p>Contains court documents, correspondence, and other material created and/or used during the commitment process, such as the order to commit and depositions containing details of the patient's behavior.  Items of note within the commitment papers are questionnaires called "interrogations" or "inquiries" that consist questions about the patient, his or her health, background, current illness, and previous treatment.  The questionnaires begin to appear beginning in 1830, and by 1837 are almost always included. In some cases a form was used, in others the reporting physician copied the questions and answered them on his own paper.  Researchers should also be aware that beginning in 1880, papers for those who were not accepted into the hospital are also included.  These papers are usually labeled "rejected."  In some cases a reason is given, such as lack of space, that the patient was suffering from epilepsy, or that he or she was a drug addict.  Additionally, unidentifiable papers have been labeled as "unknown," and placed at the back of the last folder for the particular year in which they were found.

              <p>Contains ledgers featuring lists of patients present at Western State Hospital during the course of a given year. The annual lists contain the patient's admission number, name, occupation, date of admission, sex, age, social relation, education, nativity, place of residence, number of attacks, cause of illness and its duration, date of removal or death, cause of death, and at times, notes about family medical history.  The hospital used calendar years until September 1847, when they switched to a fiscal year format that began on 1 October and ran until 30 September of the following year.  The annual lists for 1878-1907 are numbered and it appears that the first through sixth volumes are missing, since the numbering begins at volume seven.  Annual List #29 (1900-1901) is also missing. In the first volume, patient information for the years 1828-1830 is recorded in admission register format, but it is recorded in annual list format for the remaining years, 1831-1845.  (It is possible that this volume could have started out as the first admission register, with its information transferred to that ledger at a later date).  Clothing inventory lists for patients and servants during 1830-1831 are also included in this volume.  Additional information on clothing and linen inventories can be found in Series III. Financial Records, Subseries L. Supply Inventories.  The final volume (1910-1913) contains three alphabetical lists of patients present during July 1910, January 1911, and January 1913.  The annual lists contain much of the same information found in the biennial lists and admission registers, so researchers should utilize all three types of records.   </p>

              <p>Contains volumes featuring lists of patients present at Western State Hospital during the course of two fiscal years, October 1 through September 30.  The biennial lists contain information including the patient's admission number, name, sex, age, social relation, occupation, education, nativity, place of residence, number of admissions, number of attacks, cause of illness and its form, age at time of attack, admission date, removal date, amount of time spent in the asylum, duration of illness, condition upon removal or death, as well as the patient's condition and prospects for recovery if he or she continued to remain hospitalized.  Some of the volumes also contain tables of statistical information compiled from the lists.  Tables include documentation of admission numbers, discharges, deaths, civil condition (marital status), age at onset of insanity, and counties of origin.  Often a chart covering admissions from 1828 to the date of the report was also included.  One unique table is found in the biennial list for 1869-1871, which includes a list of rejected applicants.  The biennial lists contain much of the same information found in the annual lists and admission registers.   </p>

Please see reference staff if you wish to view a register that has a date range that encompasses both unrestricted and restricted content.  </emph>  Contains volumes featuring information about patient admissions, furloughs, deaths, discharges, and elopements (escapes).  All but one of the ledgers are divided according to patient sex, with sections for each action taken.  The sections contain lists of patients by month and year.  The final census (1948-1949) is divided by day and contains the same information, but for both male and female patients.  The title of "patient census" may be misleading since only those patients who were admitted, furloughed, discharged, or those who died or escaped are listed. There are many overlapping dates, but because of the similarity in content, these volumes were included here together.  It is unknown why the dates overlap, nor is there an explanation why there are more volumes devoted to female patients than to male patients.  Researchers should be aware that many similarities exist between the censuses and the ward lists, found in the section below. </p>

              <p>Contains volumes with lists of patients according to the ward on which they resided.  Patient names and dates of transfer, furlough, death, or discharge are provided, but only if such action took place during that particular year.  These volumes may be earlier versions of the patient censuses, since the ward lists contain much the same type of information, but in a different format.  In the earliest pages of the first ledger (1886-1910) there are lists of patient by ward, but little additional information.  By 1893, notes about furloughs are included in the lists, as well as identifying information such as age, weight, and residency.  Also included in this first volume are recipes, definitions of diseases, and a list of attendants who refused to remain quarantined during a small pox outbreak in 1895.  Male wards are numbered and female wards are lettered.  All of the volumes, except for one, are separated according to patient sex.  Due to the similarities between the censuses and ward lists, researchers should consult both sets of records. </p>

No viewing, photocopying, or redaction of medical records less than 125 years of age is allowed.  </emph>  Contains medical and photographic records of patients who received transorbital lobotomies at Western State Hospital.  The case book files were originally housed in an album and contain medical histories, photographs of patients before, during, and after their operations, and written descriptions of each surgery.  The contents of the album are arranged in their original order (loosely alphabetical), and the photographs have been sleeved for their protection.  The other files contain post-operation reports and patient follow-up information. Transorbital lobotomies were performed by inserting an icepick into the eye socket and tapping it with a hammer to break through the bone.  The pick was then used to "stir" the frontal lobe.  It was believed that this operation alleviated many forms of mental illness.  Most of the operations were performed by Dr. Walter Freeman, who is famous for introducing and promoting the use of transorbital lobotomy to treat mental illness in the United States.  Dr. Freeman visited Western State Hospital several times over a four year period.  During his short visits he interviewed perspective candidates and performed multiple surgeries. Western State Hospital discontinued the use of Dr. Freeman's services once the antipyschotic drug thorazine was introduced. Additional medical information on transorbital lobotomies can be found in the Operating Room Registers in a previous section.  Researchers should also note that general information on lobotomies, as well as superintendent's correspondence related to the procedure, can be found in Series I. Administrative Records, Subseries H. General Files and Ledgers, 20th Century Files.

The receiving books document the various clothing and personal items that arrived with each patient, as well as any additional items sent to the patient while he or she was hospitalized.  The valuables ledgers document items of particular value brought with each patient.  Researchers should note that the volumes in Series V. Report Books and Other Registers, Subseries K. Out Books also contain information about possessions (mostly clothes) that were checked out to patients by ward attendants. The personal effects records are part of accession 41404.

Please see reference staff if you wish to view a register that has a date range that encompasses both unrestricted and restricted content.  </emph>  Contains volumes featuring information about clothing and other personal articles belonging to Western State Hospital patients.  The receiving books were used to keep track of items received with the patient upon admission, additional articles sent from home, and those bought for the patient while he or she was living at the hospital.  The earliest two volumes chronologically list when clothing and other items were received and bought for the patients, with no division between the sexes.  The later volumes are divided by sex, but information is not recorded chronologically.  An index is usually present at the front of these later volumes.  The receiving books serve as ongoing inventories of items each patient accumulated during short periods of time, usually two or three years.  However, the most modern receiving books are arranged differently.  In these volumes, each page represents a day of the year and contains a list of all items received, as well as the name of the recipient.  There are no indices, nor are the volumes divided by ward.  For an unknown reason, the dates overlap in several of the receiving books, and gaps in time exist as well.  The foldered material was originally found in metal binders and was removed for preservation purposes.   </p>

These records include physician's reports, weekly and monthly reports of the wards, diet lists, watchman's reports, as well as registers pertaining to the library, hospital visitors and entertainment functions.  While some of the volumes provide only rudimentary information such as check marks or lists of names, the records serve to highlight the many roles staff members played in the hospital's day-to-day operation.  </p>

Please see reference staff if you wish to view a register that has a date range that encompasses both unrestricted and restricted content.  </emph>  Contains notebooks featuring information about patients upon their admission to Western State Hospital.  These notebooks are not admission registers, but instead appear to be a set of separate and less detailed records kept by the hospital staff for their own purposes.  The notebooks contain entries for each patient including the referring doctor, the date, the ward to which he or she was assigned, and other various remarks.  In later notebooks additional information was provided about the patient's current mood and behavior, and sometimes noted the type of commitment and whether the patient came from home, jail or another hospital.  Additionally, there are three notebooks containing information about medications found with patients upon their arrival at Western State.  The dates of these books overlap the dates of the admission record books, but were given the same title.  Researchers interested in admission information should see Series IV. Patient Records, Subseries A. Admission Records.  The admission report books are part of accession 41404.

The supervising attendant also kept track of his activities, such as time spent working on records and reports.

In some early volumes, the time is noted for when the patient woke up in the morning and when she retired in the evening.  Most of the ledgers appear to be divided by ward, specifically wards D, E, F, G, H and I.  The earliest volumes carried the title "Uncleanly Books," or "Attendant's Reports as to Uncleanly."  Since the information contained in these ledgers is similar to that found in the night watch/night nurse reports, researchers should cross-reference the records in Subseries I. Nightly Report Registers. The day books are part of accession 41404.

              <p>Contains the nightly reports of the gate keeper at Western State Hospital.  It appears that the gate keeper was responsible for recording who came through the front gate and at what time.  In the later ledgers, the gate keeper also notes when the outdoor lamps were lit and when he performed his check of the stable and yard.  The ledgers are very similar to the Special Watch registers found later in this subseries.  Since they have different titles and some overlapping dates, they remain separate.  Researchers would benefit from cross-referencing both types of books.  </p>

Please see reference staff if you wish to view a register that has a date range that encompasses both unrestricted and restricted content.  </emph>  Contains nightly reports of patient activities as described by the Night Watchmen and/or Night Nurses at Western State Hospital. Some volumes are titled "Night Watch," while others are titled "Night Nurse," "Watchman's Book," "Reports of the Watchman," or some other variation.  There are many inconsistencies between the ledgers due to the wide date range and because different night watch personnel recorded information in various ways.  However, despite the differences in recordkeeping style and title, the types of information contained in the ledgers are fairly consistent.  The ledgers are divided by sex, and later by ward or groups of wards.  Nightly entries document patient toilet activities, the presence of soiled bedding or clothes, whether patients slept well, or if patients were sick.  The night watch officers began duty around nine or ten in the evening, and were relieved from duty near daybreak.  The earliest volumes (1850s-1860s) contain entries written in paragraph form that only note general activities such as the changing of bed linens, administering medication, and the monitoring of servants' quarters.  At the back of the early ledgers are charts showing depth measurements of the fresh water spring, as well as the outside temperature and weather conditions.  The volumes dedicated to the male department also include notes about the watchman's morning duties of extinguishing the lights, calling the cooks, opening the gate, kitchen, and servant's quarters, as well as the ringing of the morning bell. One item of interest includes a female ward ledger dated 1863-1864 (Volume 648) which is lined with Ohio 75th Regimental muster rolls from the Civil War, dated March 1862.  How this small ledger came to be lined with these records is unknown, but the lack of paper in the South during this time could explain its reuse.  In the late 1860s, the ledgers become more chart-like, documenting the toilet activities of each patient, as well as which patients were awake and at what time.  This new recordkeeping style becomes the norm.  The weather charts are included sporadically through the 1940s.  As the patient population grew, the hospital added additional wards.  (The male wards were numbered, and the female wards lettered).  It is difficult to pinpoint exactly which wards are accounted for in some ledgers.  Since there is some confusion, the volumes have been arranged chronologically instead of by ward or groups of wards.  The volumes for which a date range could not be ascertained are included at the end of the volume list.  Some of the ledgers are for a particular ward or wards, which is noted after the date in the content list.  If no ward letter or number is found after the date, that means several (if not all) wards are accounted for in that book.  Since the content of the night watch books is very similar to that found in the day reports, and to some extent, the outside watch reports, it is recommended that researchers cross-reference those categories.   </p>

Contains nightly reports of the activities of the Night Watchmen and/or Night Nurses at Western State Hospital. It is unclear whether these are supervisory reports, but the ledgers are different than the regular Night Watch/Night Nurse books because they contain less-detailed, broader summaries of nightly activities on the wards.  These ledgers were separated from the other Night Watch/Night Nurse books because their chronologies did not fit and their content was somewhat different.

The outside watchman also noted periodic meetings with the inside watchman.  The outside watchman's shift lasted from approximately seven in the evening to half past four the next morning.  One loose page exists from an Outside Watch volume that has not been found.  This page is filed separately from the other volumes.  The Outside Watch ledgers are very similar to both the Gate Keeper's Books and Night Supervisor's Reports.  Researchers would benefit from cross-referencing all three types of records.

              <p>Contains the nightly accounts of the special watchman.  This person was in charge of monitoring the gate during the evening hours, usually starting between six and seven o'clock and ending by ten.  The names and times of entrance for each person coming through the gate were recorded.  The special watchman was also responsible for lighting the outdoor lamp and for performing a cursory check of the stable and yard before signing out.  The ledgers are very similar to the Gate Keepers Reports, but because they have different titles and some overlapping dates, they remain separate.  Researchers would benefit from cross-referencing both types of records.</p>

These reports keep track of movements on the wards, including admissions, furloughs, escapes and deaths.  The reports also note illnesses, work and job related activities, worship, and leisure pursuits.  While the ward reports do contain information about specific patients, it appears that they were used by hospital staff for statistical  purposes.  For this reason, the ward reports have been kept separate from the patient censuses and ward lists found in Series IV. Patient Records, Subseries F. Lists. Researchers may benefit from consulting both sections. These report books are part of accessions 41404 and 41253.

              <p><emph render="italic">Restricted: Report books containing patient names and information that are less than 125 years old. Please see reference staff if you wish to view a register that has a date range that encompasses both unrestricted and restricted content.  </emph>  Contains volumes with daily notations concerning the conditions and activities of the patients at Western State Hospital.  Although the volumes have various titles printed on them, they contain very similar information, in the same format.  Some of the titles include, "Report Book of the Male/Female Department," "Reports of the Assistant Physician," "Notes Relating to the Male/Female Department," and "Case Book."  The original titles have been noted in the content list.  Only the date range is provided in the list for those ledgers without titles.  The entries document patient illnesses, conflicts, complaints, medicine and treatments administered, and in some volumes, dance registers.  The earliest volumes appear to have been created by the Assistant Physician, but over time it becomes unclear who was responsible for the daily reporting function.  Based on notations found in several of the ledgers, it appears that the day-to-day information in the earliest ledgers may have been transferred into the case books found in Series IV. Patient Records, Subseries C. Case Books.  The later male department volumes (1912-1943) contain only charts tallying the number of patients in each ward who participated in certain activities such as work, worship, and the reciept of medicine.  These particular books also contain chronological notes about admissions, furloughs, elopements, deaths and transfers, but are much less informative than the earlier ledgers.   </p>

Please see reference staff if you wish to view a register that has a date range that encompasses both unrestricted and restricted content.  </emph>  Contains volumes that document monthly statistical information about patients at Western State Hospital.  The earliest volumes are set up in grids that show when a patient did housework, outside work, sewing, laundry, went to chapel, and walked outside.  These ledgers also note when seizures or "fits" took place, and the use of restraints.  Transfers, furloughs, elopements, discharges and deaths are also included in these reports.  Each day the activities of each patient are accounted for with letters or symbols that apply to each type of activity.  Definitions of the letters and symbols are usually located at either the front or back of each ledger.  In some of the ledgers, monthly accounts and descriptions of each female patient's catamenial (menstrual) period are recorded, usually at the back of the volume.  The recordkeeping technique changes in the later monthly reports, where some registers were given the title of "roll."  After approximately 1910, while each patient on the ward is still listed, the entries only note transfers, furloughs, discharges, elopements and deaths.  The volumes no longer track other patient activities.  Additionally, patient weight registers can be found at the back of several later volumes.  Researchers should also cross-reference the weight ledgers in Series IV. Patient Records, Subseries G. Medical Records.  The monthly report ledgers were maintained for individual wards, ward assignments are noted in the content list.  At the end of the list for the male department are two "Records of Monthly Reports" that compile all of the statistical data found in the monthly reports.  The number of admissions, deaths, discharges, and average number of patients in the hospital are tallied for each month.  The records also specify the number of patients in each ward.  The monthly report books are part of accessions 41404 and 41253.

The ledgers also leave room to note where or how the patients were employed at the hospital, any special activities in which they participated, or if there were any incidents or accidents.  The ledgers also have notes about specific patients in terms of admissions, furloughs, transfers, elopements and deaths.  Several weekly report volumes listed at the end of the female patient section are not quite the same as the others, though they were also made on a weekly basis.  They were included here due to the method of recording and the type of information recorded, despite the fact that they do not fit into the general chronology.  </p>

            <emph render="italic">Contains correspondence, contracts, agreements, buildings and grounds records and other miscellaneous documents found during a records transfer at Eastern State Hospital in Williamsburg, Virginia in February 2010.  According to records at Eastern State and Western State, the documents were removed from the Western State archives in 1983 and used by researchers to accurately reconstruct the Public Hospital at Colonial Williamsburg.  The records were never returned to Western State and were eventually found in a basement at Eastern State in 1987.  The records were taken to the Eastern State archives where they were housed until Eastern State transferred its historical records to the Library of Virginia.  The records remain part of Eastern State Hospital accession 44812. </emph>
          </p>
          <p>Files are split into three categories: correspondence, subject files, and volumes.  Most of the records in this series pertain to buildings, construction projects, contracting for supplies and labor, and basic hospital operations.
