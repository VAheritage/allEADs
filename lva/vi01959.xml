</head>
      <p>John Rutherfoord was born on 6 December 1792 in Richmond, Virginia. Rutherfoord was the eldest son of Thomas Rutherfoord, a merchant and native of Scotland, and Sarah Winston.  Educated at Princeton College, Rutherfoord studied law and was admitted to the Richmond bar.  He represented Richmond as its sole delegate in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1826 to 1834.  Rutherfoord was then elected to the Council of State on 16 December 1836 serving as lieutenant governor during Governor David Campbell's absence between 19 July and 27 October 1838.  Rutherfoord was reelected to another three-year term in the Council on 1 April 1839.  In this capacity, Rutherfoord succeeded John M. Patton on 31 March 1841 as acting governor following the resignation of Governor Thomas W. Gilmer.  As acting governor, Rutherfoord helped resolve the conflict with Governor William H. Seward of New York regarding the extradition of a fugitive who abducted slaves from Virginia. It was this conflict that prompted Governor Gilmer's resignation.  Rutherfoord served as acting governor until 31 March 1842 and continued to serve in the Council until 29 March 1845. 
</p>
      <p>
In 1836, Rutherfoord was elected principal agent of the Mutual Assurance Society, serving as president until his death.  He also established and served as the first captain, and later colonel, of the Richmond Fayette Artillery.  Rutherfoord married Emily Anne Coles, daughter of John &amp; Rebecca Coles of Albemarle County, on 23 April 1816.  He died on 3 August 1866 and was survived by his only son John Coles Rutherfoord of Goochland County, Virginia, and Emily Anne, wife of Patrick Henry Aylett.  Rutherfoord was buried at Shockoe Hill Cemetery.
