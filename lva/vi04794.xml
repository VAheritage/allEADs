      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Madison County was named for James Madison, a Virginian statesman, author of the United States Constitution, and member of Congress when the county was formed from Culpeper County by a statute adopted on 4 December 1792. This was the second Virginia county to be named for future president Madison. The county court first met on 23 May 1793. The county seat is Madison.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Madison County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1794-1919, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.

          <p>Hill and Taylor were business partners engaged in the slave trade, buying enslaved people in Virginia for the purposes of selling the enslaved people further south, specifically in Mississippi and Louisiana. After the partnership dissolved, Hill sued Taylor to recover his fair share of the profits. Hill asked the court to perform an audit of all the partnership's transactions from the time of its commencement to its dissolution. Included in the suit are lists containing the names of hundreds of enslaved people bought in Virginia and sold down south between 1830 to 1843. The lists record the names of enslaved people, the purchase price in Virginia, the sale price in Mississippi and Louisiana, the date of sale, and the names of the buyers.

          <p>Jacob G. Weast found a substitute for Benjamin Burton in the Confederate Army ca. 1861 and was promised 500 dollars in three payments. Weast collected one payment before Burton died. Weast and Edwin P. Rosson, the co-plaintiff, sued for the remainder. The administrator contended that the debt was invalid because it concerned service for the Confederate States of America, and the only true government of Virginia was the Restored Government now back in place in Richmond. The argument failed; the court ruled in favor of Weast and Rosson.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The suit is concerned with the settlement of Charles Hume's estate. Hume died in 1860 and provided for Charles and Hay Taliaferro, two elderly enslaved men, in his will. Charles died before or shortly after Hume. There was dissent between Hay and Hume's executors as to the contents of an agreement developed between Hay and the executors regarding Hay's care and maintenance. Hay, a petitioner to the suit, claimed to have been duped by the executors into signing an agreement that was not to his benefit. A decree from the Supreme Court of Appeals in the suit seemed to imply that Hay has no standing in the suit since he was freed at the end of the Civil War.
