<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Born in 1830 in York County, Virginia, to James E. and Eliza A. White Chandler, Silas Chandler moved to Middlesex County, Virginia. When the Civil War began, he enlisted in Company B, 55th Virginia Infantry. Company B later was detached and made into Fleet's Artillery Company. He was wounded at Antietam, and later taken prisoner there. Exchanged, he fought at Chancellorsville and at Gettysburg, where he again was wounded. Chandler's unit was later sent to Tennessee, where it arrived just after the battle of Chickamauga. Chandler returned to the Army of Northern Virginia, and served through the siege of Petersburg and surrendered at Appomattox Court House. After the war, Chandler returned to Middlesex County where he was a farmer and an oysterman. He married Ann Elizabeth Gayle (1837-by 1880) 28 December 1852 and they had 8 children. He married Mary C. Gayle (1842-1913) 11 January 1881. Chandler died April 1912.
