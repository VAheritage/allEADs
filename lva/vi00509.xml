         <p>Born in 1830 in York County, Virginia, to James E. and
         Eliza A. White Chandler, Silas Chandler moved to Middlesex
         County, Virginia. When the Civil War began, he enlisted in
         Company B, 55th Virginia Infantry. Company B later was
         detached and made into Fleet's Artillery Company. Chandler was
         wounded at Antietam and later taken prisoner there. Exchanged,
         he fought at Chancellorsville and at Gettysburg, where he
         again was wounded. Chandler returned to the Army of Northern
         Virginia and served through the siege of Petersburg and
         surrendered at Appomattox Court House. After the war, Chandler
         returned to Middlesex County, where he was a farmer and an
         oysterman. He married Ann Elizabeth Gayle (1837- by 1880) on
         28 December 1852. They had eight children. He married Mary C.
         Gayle (1842-1913) on 11 January 1881. Chandler died in April
         1912.</p>
