</head>
<p>Marion Johnson Dimmock was born in Portsmouth, Virginia in 1824 and moved to Richmond in 1833. He served in the Confederate Army, attaining the rank of captain. He became one of the most prolific Virginia
architects in the period 1870-1900. Among his more prominant commissions during this period were the Confederate Memorial Chapel (1887), a hotel in Elkton, Virginia (1890), Richmond Chamber of Commerce Building
(1891-1892), Mortuary Chapel in Hollywood Cemetery (1897-1898), and an addition to the State Library Building (Dimmock &amp; Lee, 1908).

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>These six sheets depict a Queen Anne styled church structure with some Gothic Revival influences by Marion J. Dimmock. The church was known as St. Luke's Protestant Episcopal Church in Clover, Halifax County,
Virginia. Dimmock's structure replaced an 1873 church building that was destroyed by fire. The building features drip moldings over the windows and lancet windows that show some Gothic Revival influence. This is
likely the result of its function as a church. The shingled gable ends with recessed arches give this building a decidedly Queen Anne styling. As of 2003, the structure was still extant (with a major addition to
the west elevation) and is used by different denomination's congregation.
</p>
<p>The first sheet of this set of drawings bears Dimmock's office stamp requesting that they be returned, indicating that these are original records from his architectural practice.
