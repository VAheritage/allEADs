        <p>The state government faced serious problems in
            mobilizing for war after Virginia seceded from the Union on
            April 27, 1861. In response to this, the secession
            convention passed an ordinance on April 27, creating a
            board of commissioners to audit and settle all account for
            expenses and claims incurred in the defense of the state.
            This included assembling, arming, equipping and maintaining
            troops and the navy, transporting munitions, and paying for
            damages. This ordinance was repealed on April 30, 1861,
            when a new, more comprehensive ordinance was passed.
            Although the three members of the board initially were
            appointed by the convention, vacancies were filled by the
            governor. The board continued in operation until the end of
            the Civil War.</p>
        <p>The United States Arsenal at Harper's Ferry was seized
            by Virginia militia under Colonel Turner Ashby on April 18,
            1861. All of the weapons, machinery, and stock were
            confiscated by the Confederate States government and
            transported to the Richmond Armory shortly thereafter. This
            massive task began in June 1861 under the direction of
            James H. Burton, Superintendent of the Richmond Armory.
            Once the materials were evacuated, Col. Joseph E.
            Johnston's troops burned the armory buildings and the Rifle
            Works. Some of the factory workers who stayed loyal to the
            south relocated to work in the Richmond Armory, while
            others went to Fayetteville, N.C.</p>

        <p>Contains accounts, affidavits, correspondence, extracts
            from Federal rolls, payrolls, powers of attorney, and
            receipts related to the settlement of accounts by the
            Auditing Board for services performed at the Harper's Ferry
            Armory in 1861. The accounts include both those to the
            Confederate States of America and the State of Virginia.
            The Confederate States of America accounts include a
            receipt and an affidavit from Alfred M. Barbour, late
            superintendent of the U.S. Armory. Each claimant swore an
            oath to the Confederate States of America before George W.
            Munford, President of the Auditing Board. The accounts to
            the State of Virginia are also signed by Barbour and
            include a receipt and affidavit for services rendered.
            There are five separate affidavits from the fathers of
            armory workers swearing that their sons are under
            twenty-one years of age. There is correspondence between
            James H. Burton, Superintendent of the C.S. Armory, and
            Munford regarding the account of John Cross. Burton also
            corresponded with J. Bell Bigger, Clerk of the Auditing
            Board, regarding John Cross and Samuel Shewbridge's
            account. There are also letters to Bigger from Joseph
            Schoppert and James H. Holt regarding powers of attorney
            and accounts. Three letters from Thomas W. Shriver,
            Ordnance Dept., to Bigger regarding accounts. The extracts
            from Federal rolls list the names, operations, number,
            price and amount for work done by Federal employees at the
            armory in April 1861.</p>
        <p>There are four payrolls found in these records. The
            payrolls include the name, occupation, time or number of
            days employed, wages, and amount for work done in June and
            July 1861. The powers of attorney were issued by employees
            to appoint individuals to draw and receive pay on their
            behalf. Some of these documents are for individuals who
            relocated to the armories in Richmond and Fayetteville,
            N.C. There are two receipts in the collection: one for pay
            and the other for the removal of gun stocks from the
            armory. Lastly, there is a return of work done at the U.S.
            Armory which lists the names, occupation, number, price,
            and amount of work done at the U.S. Armory between March
            and April 1861.</p>
