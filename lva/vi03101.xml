      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories. 
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Amelia County was named for Amelia Sophia Eleanora, daughter of King George II. It was formed from Prince George and Brunswick Counties by an act passed in 1734 to take effect on 25 March 1735. The county court first met on 9 May 1735. The county seat is Amelia.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Amelia County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1738-1939 (bulk 1747-1913) consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics. 
</p>
      <p>While there are several suits concerning the freedom of enslaved individuals, these cases largely represent the perspective of white enslavers and their disputes involving the sale, hiring, financial responsibilities, and legality of ownership of Black individuals. Under the system of chattel slavery, laws permitted enslavers to treat enslaved people as personal possessions in the same manner as livestock, farm equipment, or household items.
</p>
<p>Some commonly found surnames among the plaintiffs and defendants in Chancery Causes 1738-1939 include Archer, Barden, Bass, Bevel (also spelled Bevil, Bevill, and Beville), Blanton, Booker, Bottom, Burton, Cousins, Craddock, Deaton, Eggleston, Farley, Ford, Foster, Green, Hardaway, Holt, Jackson, Jeter, Leath, Mann, Mumford, Munford, Noble, Perkinson, Pollard, Pride, Randolph, Rowlett, Royall (also spelled Royal), Seay, Southall, Steger, Tabb, Thraves, Townes, Tucker, Vaughn, Walthall (also spelled Walthal), Webster, Willson, Wilson, Wingo, Worsham, and Wright.

      <head>Selected Suits of Interest

<p><title render="italic">Causes of Interest are identified by local records archivists during processing and indexing. These causes are generally selected based upon guiding principles of having historical, genealogical or sensational significance; however, determining what is âof interestâ is subjective, and the individual perspective and experience of the describing archivist will affect the material identified.</title>

        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>Suckey, described as a âmulattoâ woman, was purchased from John Jones of Dinwiddie County, her enslaver, by Benjamin Crawley, who later emancipated Suckey and her son, Jonathan. Crawleyâs will stipulated that Suckey be provided with several enslaved people and land throughout the remainder of her life, and she sued to the administrator of the estate to fulfill the provisions of the will.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>Jarrett claimed that the executors of his enslaverâs will, despite the will including a provision freeing Jarrett, sold him to John B. Chaffin because of debts the estate owed to various creditors. He petitioned the court for his freedom, stating that he was being âillegally detained as a slave.â The court ultimately determined that Jarrett was indeed free, assuming the estate of Jarrettâs enslaver was sufficient to pay the debts.

          <p>Billy, along with Booker, John, and William Peyton, petitioned the court to free them based on a provision in Thomas Blankenship, their enslaver's, will.

These suits involve additional descendants of Rachel, a formerly enslaved woman and an ancestor all the enslaved complainants have in common, whose emancipation by the will of Jordan Anderson Sr., and a deed Anderson made in 1790, were the impetus for the various chancery causes.
