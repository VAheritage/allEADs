<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Manchester was established as a town by the General Assembly in November 1769. According to this act, "the honorable William Byrd hath lately laid out a parcel of his lands at Rocky Ridge, at the falls of the James River, in the county of Chesterfield, in lots and streets for a town."  Directors and trustees were appointed and the town was named Manchester. The town was incorporated on February 27, 1834. On March 20, 1874, a city charter was approved by the General Assembly and the city was divided into 4 wards. Three members from each ward served on the City Council, the main governing body of the city along with the mayor. On April 15, 1910, the city of Manchester was officially annexed to the City of Richmond with the provisos that a free bridge would be constructed to connect Manchester with Richmond and that Manchester would retain a courthouse. Today the area is also known as South Richmond. The town of Manchester was named probably for Manchester Parish in Chesterfield County. The parish in turn was named either for George Montague, fourth duke of Manchester, or for the town of Manchester, England.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Manchester (Va.) Board of Alderman Minute Book, 1902-1910, covers the adminstrative functions of this governing body. The Board of Alderman of the City of Manchester, like the City Assembly, was formed on February 15, 1901 by Virginia's General Assembly. According to the Acts of the Assembly (p. 241), "the administration and government of the city shall be vested in one principal officer, to be styled the mayor; the City Council to be composed of the Board of Alderman, consisting of two members from each ward, and the City Assembly, consisting of three members from each ward." Furthermore, "each board composing the city council shall have one regular meeting during each month and as many special or called meetings as the interests of the city shall require. A majority of the members elected to each board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. No ordinances or resolutions shall become a law of the city until adopted by a majority of each board present and voting." Unlike the City Assembly, however, the Board of Alderman was not officially organized until July 2, 1902. The volume deals primarily with building permits, committees and ordinances. The volume has an internal index (A-W) organized alphabetically by subject according to the order in which it appears in the volume.
