<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p><title render="bold">Context for Record Type:  </title>In 1782 the General Assembly of Virginia enacted a major revision of the tax laws of the commonwealth. The act provided for statewide enumeration on the county level of land and certain personal property. The act created a permanent source of revenue for the operation of government in Virginia.</p>
<p>Various revenue acts passed by the General Assembly established the tax rates and procedures for the collection of land and personal property taxes. At first, justices of the local court were designated to collect the taxes. By 1786, the county courts were directed to divide each locality into precincts and to appoint "commissioners" to collect the tax. Taxes were assessed between March and April of each year and were payable by the end of December. The commissioners prepared four "fair and correct" copies of the land tax books. Copies were prepared for the commissioner, county clerk, sheriff, and auditor of public accounts.</p>
<p>A warrant was an authority issued to a collector of taxes, empowering his to collect the taxes extended on the assessment roll, and to make distress and sale of goods or land in default of payment.</p>
<p>A tax book is a record of persons paying taxes on personal or real estate. They may contain a record of other taxes levied on the official documents produced or recorded by the local government. They may also contain taxes levied on goods and services provided by individuals or businesses in the counties or cities.</p>
<p><title render="bold">Locality History:  </title> Greensville County was named either for Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene, commanding general of the Continental army in the South during part of the Revolutionary War, or for Sir Richard Grenville, leader of the Roanoke Island settlement of 1585. The county was formed from Brunswick County on 28 November 1780.</p>
