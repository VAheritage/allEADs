         <head>Biographical Information</head>
         <p>James Wood, Jr., was born in Winchester, Virginia, on 28
         January 1741, to Col. James Wood and Mary Rutherford. His
         public service began at a young age as deputy clerk and deputy
         surveyor for Frederick County, while also serving as clerk of
         the vestry of Frederick Parish. In 1766, Wood began his first
         term as a representative to Frederick County in the House of
         Burgesses, serving in that capacity until 1775. Wood married
         Jean Moncure of Stafford County in 1775 and settled at
         Hawthorn, the home built on his family's estate of Glen Burnie
         in Winchester. Wood had a distinguished military career
         beginning as a captain during Dunmore's War and continuing as
         colonel of the 8th Virginia Regiment Continental Line during
         the Revolution. In 1779, Wood became Post Commandant of the
         Albemarle Barracks in Charlottesville which accommodated the
         Convention Army Guard created to guard the prisoners taken
         from John Burgoyne's army on 17 October 1777.In 1781, he was
         named Commissioner of Prisoners for Virginia and Maryland. By
         the end of the war, Wood had obtained the rank of brigadier
         general of Virginia troops. Wood was also a member of the 1st
         (1774) and 5th (1776) Virginia Conventions. He served two
         terms in the House of Delegates in 1776 and 1784-1785. During
         the interim, Wood was a member of the Council of State,
         serving as Lieutenant Governor, the head of that body, for
         several terms. As Lieutenant Governor, Wood performed the
         duties as governor on a number of occasions, most notably
         during the long absence of Governor Henry Lee in 1794. The
         pinnacle of Wood's long public service came on 1 December 1796
         when he was elected by the General Assembly to succeed Robert
         Brooke as governor of Virginia. Wood was reelected for two
         additional one-year terms until 6 December 1799 and his
         governorship was distinguished by the construction of the
         Virginia Penitentiary and Manufactory of Arms. Following his
         terms as governor, Wood returned to service on the Council of
         State until his death on 17 June 1813. Wood is buried at St.
         John's Church in Richmond.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>James Wood's Executive papers are organized chronologically
         with undated items arranged at the end of each year. These
         papers primarily consist of incoming correspondence during
         Wood's three one-year terms as governor between 1 December
         1796 until 6 December 1799. The correspondence in this
         collection relates to a variety of topics including
         appointments &amp; recommendations for state positions; the
         construction of the Virginia Penitentiary &amp; Manufactory of
         Arms; the Point of Fork Arsenal; foreign vessels in Virginia
         waters; resignations; arms &amp; ammunition; the boundary line
         between Kentucky &amp; Virginia; extraditions; state expenses
         &amp; revenue; quarantine of vessels; elections; Presidential
         electors; the Capitol Building; the militia; and others. In
         addition to correspondence, there are resolutions from
         Congress and the Virginia Senate &amp; House of Delegates;
         accounts; oaths; contracts; pardons; proposals; receipts;
         election returns &amp; certificates; qualifications; lists;
         proclamations; petitions; reports; appointments; resignations;
         bonds; commissions; orders; proceedings; applications;
         opinions; and other sundry items.</p>
         <p>The majority of correspondence relates to two significant
         building projects commenced during Wood's terms in office: the
         Virginia Penitentiary and the Virginia Manufactory of Arms.
         The Governor received numerous letters of application and
         recommendations for architects and superintendents for the
         construction of the Penitentiary. Benjamin Henry Latrobe was
         eventually named architect and Thomas Callis as superintendent
         of the project. Included is a letter from John Barret offering
         lots on the street opposite Hay Market for the site of the
         Penitentiary (1797 Jan. 11). Especially valuable is Thomas
         Jefferson's letter to the Governor on 31 March 1797 regarding
         his design of a prison which includes notes and an estimate
         for its construction. Many individuals submitted proposals for
         such tasks as laying bricks (1797 March 27, July 14 &amp; 20,
         Oct. 9), furnishing bar iron (1798 June 4), and woodwork (1798
         July 28). In addition, on 12 June 1798, John Mills and John
         Atkerson write agreeing to undertake the digging of the
         foundation. Thomas Callis also writes regarding laying the
         foundation (1797 Aug. 3), an estimate of the whole expense of
         erecting the Penitentiary (1797 Dec. 5), an account of the
         carpenter's work and an estimate for framing the roof (1798
         May 26), the contract for the doors &amp; window frames and
         slate for the roof (1798 July 3), the account of Reuben George
         for timber plank &amp; scantling (1798 Nov. 30), and an
         account of the receipts given Harvie &amp; Winston (1799 Feb.
         14). Benjamin Latrobe periodically reports on topics including
         the foundation (1797 Aug. 7), his bill as architect (1798 Feb.
         14), directions for the stone &amp; brickwork (1798 March 10),
         the account of slate for the roof including a small sketch
         with measurements (1798 July 10), the arch of the cellar under
         the kitchen and the proposal for carpenter's work (1798 July
         9), the new road to the Penitentiary and sewers including a
         rough drawing (1798 Sept. 3 &amp; 8), an account of the stone
         work and an estimate of the expense for altering the design of
         the roof to a gable roof (1798 Sept. 22), the conduct of a
         blacksmith who assaulted some workmen (1798 Oct. 26), the
         progress in the Penitentiary since 1797 with specific work
         done on the east &amp; west wings, the gate, and the men's
         court including the expense of the work (1798 Nov. 28), and a
         request for a leave of absence until Christmas (1798 Nov. 30).
         Latrobe's letter dated 1798 Sept. 8 also discusses the
         Council's proposition to remove him as architect. In another
         letter dated 23 Feb. 1799, Latrobe communicates the completion
         of his work on the Penitentiary, problems with his work in
         Philadelphia on the Bank of Pennsylvania which has delayed his
         return to Richmond, instructions to the bricklayer, and a
         recommendation for William Callis as Superintendent. Other
         miscellaneous items regarding the Penitentiary include letters
         from John Harvie regarding a draft from the Treasury to
         purchase oyster shells for lime in the construction (1797 May
         11), an account of Augustine Davis for various work (1797 July
         10); a letter from Samuel Dobie requesting compensation for
         his plan of the Penitentiary submitted to the Council (1797
         Aug. 17); a recommendation of Harry Tetherston as blacksmith
         for the iron work (1798 March 6); prices for scantling and
         plank from Ebenezer Maule (1798 March 10); letters from John
         Clarke concerning bricklayers and a supply of iron for the
         blacksmiths (1799 June 22), shingling (1799 Sept. 14), and an
         estimate of bricks &amp; lime to complete the building (1799
         Sept. 28); and letters from Jesse Bowles &amp; Nathaniel
         Quarles on the walls, arches, etc. (1798 Aug. 16) and the east
         &amp; west wings (1799 Aug. 17).</p>
         <p>The Virginia Manufactory of Arms is the other major
         building project during Wood's governorship. In 1796, the
         House of Delegates passed resolutions for employing additional
         artificers at the Point of Fork Arsenal and for ascertaining
         the best location in Richmond for an arsenal &amp; manufactory
         of arms (1796 Dec. 26). John Clarke was appointed
         superintendent of the armory in 1798. Clarke visited the
         armory in Springfield, Massachusetts, and the Cecil Iron Works
         in Maryland. He writes the Governor on 7 March 1798 from
         Philadelphia regarding his trip. He again writes on March 10
         concerning his failure to have 4,000 stand of arms
         manufactured in Philadelphia and considers the possibility of
         having arms imported from France. On 10 April 1798, Clarke
         informs Wood about his delay in reaching Springfield. On 23
         July 1798, Clarke remarks on the cost of the houses, water
         works, etc., for the manufactory of small arms. Shortly
         thereafter, he comments on the cost of stonework (1798 July
         27). Lastly, Clarke writes on several occasions respecting the
         digging of the foundation by Moses Bates (1798 Nov. 19, 1799
         March 21, June 15, &amp; Aug. 20, Oct. 19). Other items
         related to the Manufactory include a letter from John Hardien
         &amp; Benjamin Hailey proposing to furnish bricks for the
         armory (1798 Aug. 21); the bond of Jesse Payne, James Mann,
         Daniel Burton, &amp; William G. Payne to furnish timber &amp;
         plank for the machinery (1798 Nov. 20), a report of the
         Committee of the Executive appointed to examine the progress
         &amp; quality of the masonry (1799 Aug. 27), and Ninnan Wyse's
         stonework contract (1799 Nov. 16).</p>
         <p>Other public projects continued during Wood's tenure as
         governor with work on the Capitol Building. The Directors of
         Public Buildings, including Daniel L. Hylton, William Foushee,
         William Hay, Richard Adams, Robert Goode, and Robert Mitchell,
         provide the Governor with periodic updates on the status of
         repairs to the Capitol, particularly the roof. On 31 August
         1797, the Directors write regarding an advance with the
         undertaker to finish the outside of the Capitol and the
         problems with the slate roof. The Directors request additional
         warrants for funds on 11 Oct. 1797, 12 Dec. 1797, and 24 July
         1798. An abstract of the proceedings of the Directors from
         William Hay provides an excellent summary of their activities
         between 1779 and 1793. On 5 Feb. 1798, the Directors enclose a
         report with a general account of transactions and the probable
         estimate to finish the Capitol. Goode &amp; Foushee also write
         on 27 Aug. 1798 regarding the construction of two reservoirs
         on the Public Square. Additionally, the Directors write
         concerning the sale of public lead, as well as compensation to
         the directors &amp; commissioners (1798 Oct. 20). Finally,
         Foushee writes regarding the completion of the Capitol roof
         and a warrant for $1000 for Henry Robertson to finish the
         outside of the Capitol (1798 Oct. 23). Other miscellaneous
         documents relating to the Capitol include a letter from John
         Johnson offering to contract to fill up the ravine near the
         Capitol (1797 Oct. 5), a letter from William Foushee regarding
         compensation for the Directors of Public Buildings (1798 Feb.
         5), the account of Wyse &amp; Hope for rebuilding the stone
         wall near the Capitol (1798 April 18), a letter from William
         Hay recommending Benjamin Latrobe to inspect the Capitol's
         roof (1798 Aug. 9), and a letter from William Hay regarding
         the plans &amp; drawings of the Capitol &amp; Public Prison
         sent from Paris by Thomas Jefferson (1799 March 18).</p>
         <p>Governor Wood's Executive Papers also include
         correspondence from the United States government. Wood
         received letters from Timothy Pickering, Secretary of State;
         James McHenry, Secretary of War; Samuel A. Otis, Secretary of
         the Senate, John Beckley &amp; Jonathan W. Cody, Clerks of the
         House of Representatives, Thomas Jefferson, Vice-President,
         and Virginia Delegates in Congress.</p>
         <p>Timothy Pickering writes the Governor on 26 June 1797
         enclosing an "act to provide for the further defense of the
         ports &amp; harbors of the United States." Pickering also
         transmits sets of acts passed in the 1st session of the 5th
         Congress on 26 Oct. 1797, as well as the first volume of the
