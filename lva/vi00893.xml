<p>On January 23, 1860, the General Assembly passed an act appointing commissioners to audit and pay the expenses incurred by the Executive for the purchase of arms and munitions, and for the defence of the commonwealth. This board was to consist of the secretary of the commonwealth, the auditor of public accounts, and the adjutant general. The board's function was to settle all accounts incurred in assembling, arming, equipping, transporting, and maintaining troops during John Brown's Raid on Harper's Ferry. The auditor of public accounts then issued warrants to the individuals entitled compensation. On March 6 and again on March 28, 1860, further appropriations were passed by the General Assembly to defray these expenses. Please note that this board of commissioners should not be confused with a similar board established on January 1, 1860, by "an act making an appropriation for the purchase and manufacture of arms and munitions of war."

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Volume contains a chronological list of claims of individuals, businesses, etc., who were owed money for their contribution in the defense of Virginia during John Brown's Raid on Harper's Ferry between January 25, 1860, and January 11, 1861. This volume seems to correspond with John Brown's Raid Military Expenses (Acc.# 36955). A brief description of the item or service, the date, and a dollar amount were entered into the ledger. Some of the expenses include forage, lodging, meals, damages, mules, transportation of troops, payment for military service, etc. Separate entries in the volume are included for the following: expenses on account of pay (p. 50-55), accounts reported to the General Assembly (p. 97), subsistence and commissariat (p. 101-103), expenses on account of use of property and property lost in service of the state (p. 193), police and secret service of the state (p. 197), expenses of the medical department (p. 199), expenses for transportation and the Quartermaster General Department (p. 201-206), and expenses of the Ordnance Department (p. 301).
