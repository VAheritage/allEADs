         <head>Historical Information</head>
         <p>The General Assembly passed an act on March 2, 1866 to
         reorganize the militia. This act provided that the county or
         corporation courts appoint, for each regiment of militia,
         three people to conduct the elections of field and company
         officers. The General Assembly passed another act on March 29,
         1871 to provide for the organization of the Volunteer Militia
         of the State, and to repeal existing laws concerning the same.
         The militia, known as the Virginia Volunteers, was to consist
         of volunteers to be called into service in case of war,
         invasion, riots, etc. The militia was organized into companies
         of 50 to 100 men which in turn were organized into regiments
         of 6 to 10 companies. The regiments were then organized into
         brigades and divisions. The officers of the militia were
         examined by a board consisting of three officers who issued a
         certificate to the officer if deemed competent. The
         certificate was then returned to the adjutant general and the
         officer was commissioned by the governor. All commissioned and
         non-commissioned officers were also required to take an oath
         of allegiance to the state of Virginia and support the United
         States constitution. Following the passage of the National
         Defense Act in 1916, the Virginia State militia changed its
         name from the Virginia Volunteers to the Virginia National
         Guard.</p>
