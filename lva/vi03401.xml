      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories. 
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Nelson County was formed in 1807 from Amherst County.  The county was named for Thomas Nelson, Jr., governor of Virginia from June to November 1781. The county seat is Lovingston.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Nelson County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1808-1964 consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics. Photocopies of documents may be found in the collection.
</p>
      <p>These records contain two boxes of "Orphan Chancery" which are processed but not indexed. These records contain parts, often single items, of chancery causes which could not be be further identified as belonging to a certain case.

          <p>Richard C. Pollard sued John Whitehead for the worth of Edmund, an enslaved man deeded to Pollard's mother by James Hopkins, her father, and later purchased by Whitehead. A deed of loan in the case between Elizabeth Pollard and James Hopkins, gave her control over a group of enslaved people who were to be freed after their terms of service were completed. Included as an exhibit in the case is the petition of Torrisman Lockett, an enslaved man who sued for his freedom on the basis that his mother Hannah was one of the enslaved people emancipated in the deed of loan and Hopkin's will.  However the will stated that the male offspring of the enslaved women would be emancipated at the age of forty and at the time of his suit Torrisman Lockett was under the age of twenty-one.
