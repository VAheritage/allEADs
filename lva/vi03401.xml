      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Chancery Causes  are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law."  A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
      <p>Nelson County was formed in 1807 from Amherst County.  The county was named for Thomas Nelson, Jr., governor of Virginia from June to November 1781.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Nelson County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1808-1912, are indexed into the Chancery Records Index. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records, marriage records and vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted on the main folder for the cause, as are wills.  Photocopies of documents may be found in the collection.
</p>
      <p>Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.
</p>
      <p>In addition, chancery causes for Nelson County may reference or contain documents from the following counties and cities in Virginia: Amherst, Albemarle, Augusta, Bedford, Buckingham, Goochland, Highland and King William counties and the cities of Lynchburg and Richmond.
</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement encodinganalog="351">
      <head>Arrangement
</head>
      <p>Organized by case, of which each is assigned a unique index number comprised of the latest year found in case and a sequentially increasing 3-digit number assigned by the processor as cases for that year are found. Arranged chronologically. 
</p>
      <p>Arrangement of documents within each folder are as follows: Bill, Answer, and Final Decree (if found.)

        <scopecontent>
          <p>Richard C. Pollard sues John Whitehead for the worth of the slave Edmund, deeded to his mother by her father James Hopkins and later purchased by Whitehead. A deed of loan in the case between James Hopkins and his daughter Elizabeth Pollard gave her control over a group of slaves that were to be freed after their terms of service were completed. Names and birth information were provided for the slaves listed in the deed. Included in the deed was the slave Phillis, the supposed mother of Edmund. Included as an exhibit in the case is the petition of Toisman Locket who sued for his freedom on the basis that his mother Hannah was one of the slaves emancipated in the deed of loan and in Hopkins's will. However the will stated that the male offspring of the slaves would be emancipated at the age of forty and at the time of his suit Toisman was under the age of twenty-one.
