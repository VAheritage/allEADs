<p>These items came to the Library of Virginia in a transfer of court records from Nelson County under the accession number 42148.

<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Chancery Causes  are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law."  A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
<p>Nelson County was formed in 1807 from Amherst County.  The county was named for Thomas Nelson, Jr., governor of Virginia from June to November 1781.
</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a">
<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Nelson County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1808-1912, are indexed into the Chancery Records Index. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted on the main folder for the cause, as are wills.  Photocopies of documents may be found in the collection.
</p>
<p>Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.
</p>
<p>In addition, chancery causes for Nelson County may reference or contain documents from the following counties and cities in Virginia: Amherst, Albemarle, Augusta, Bedford, Buckingham, Goochland, Highland and King William counties and the cities of Lynchburg and Richmond.
