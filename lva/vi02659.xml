      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
      <p>Middlesex County probably was named for the English county. It was formed from Lancaster County about 1669.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Middlesex County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1754-1912, are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
      <p>Chancery cases are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.

          <p>Estate dispute contains family correspondence between the Jones and Calef families. 17 May 1843, Sallie Calef writes to David Calef to describe her husband's death; the education of her daughter at Gothic Seminary in Northampton, Massachusetts, where she studied geometry, chemistry, and Latin; and the theft by her slaves of barrels of corn intended for horse feed which resulted in the death of seven of her horses. 15 January 1845, Daniel J. Calef writes to his mother about advising his Aunt Sally Calef "to dispose of her nap heads or Blacks," and he goes on to write, "you can't imagine how the slaves want waching. Everything has to be put under lock and key or they would steel it. They are a pac of unprophetable servents." 24 September 1850, Elliott P. Jones writes to D. J. Calef relating an incident with his teacher O. White in which White "called a whipping" that Jones was not strong enough to prevent - "would I have crushed the man who dared to treat me as a negro, but I could not." 26 February 1860, Elliot P. Jones writes to his cousin discussing the approaching Civil War - Virginia is "now arming and preparing herself for active war.... I hope to God we may not have to use our men, but if the North is determined to force upon us a Black Republican President, then I am willing, ready, and anxious for the conflict."

Times was very bad in Scotland when I left it and great numbers leaving it to come to America."
