<head>Processing Information
</head>
<p>Middlesex Chancery was processed in three batches. Library of Virginia staff processed Middlesex Chancery Causes found in Middlesex Judgements prior to 1999. Additional Middlesex Chancery was found in Judgements and processed in 2007. After a transfer of Middlesex county records in 2011, additional Chancery Causes were processed and completed in 2013. Each successive batch completed was indexed and added to the end of the collection rather than interfiled.</p>
<p>Digital images were generated  in 2008 by Crowley Micrographics through the Library of Virginia's Circuit Court Records Preservation Program. Additional digital images were generated in 2013 by Backstage Library Works through the Library of Virginia's Circuit Court Records Preservation Program. 
</p>
<p>Post-1912 records were previously described separately under the title Middlesex County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1913-1919. Records are now described together.</p>
<p>Chancery Causes 1913-1919 are unprocessed. At this time, there are no plans to process these records.</p>

      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><title render="bold">Context for Record Type:</title> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories. 
</p>
      <p><title render="bold">Locality History:</title> Middlesex County probably was named for the English county. It was formed from Lancaster County about 1669. The county seat is Saluda. 
</p>
<p><title render="bold">Lost Locality Notes:</title>Created in 1669. Numerous loose records from the nineteenth century are missing, including chancery, judgments, and commonwealth causes. Most volumes (including deed books, will books, and order books) exist because court clerk Philemon T. Woodward removed them from the courthouse for safekeeping during the Civil War.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Middlesex County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1754-1919, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.
</p>
      <p>Middlesex County is located on the Middle Peninsula on the western shore of Chesapeake Bay. Due to its location, the county was involved in the oyster farming trade, a fact which appears across a number of chancery cases. 
</p>
<p>These records contain one box of "Orphan Chancery" which is processed but not indexed. These records contain parts, often single items, of chancery causes which could not be be further identified as belonging to a certain case.</p>
