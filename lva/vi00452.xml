         <p>Christopher Valentine Winfree was born 14 November 1826 in
         Lynchburg, Virginia, to Christopher Winfree (1785-1858) and
         Cornelia Meyer Tilden. Winfree grew up just outside of
         Lynchburg in Campbell County, Virginia. He attended the
         Virginia Military Academy, graduating in 1848. A civil
         engineer, he worked for the East Tennessee and Virginia
         Railroad, then worked on railroads in Mississippi, before
         returning to Lynchburg in 1858. Winfree then became involved
         in tobacco manufacturing. When the Civil War began, he was a
         lieutenant in the Lynchburg Rifles, which became Company E,
         11th Virginia Infantry. He served in the Confederate army in
         1861, rising to the rank of captain. In 1862, he returned to
         Lynchburg as a major in the Virginia service and commanded the
         home guard around Lynchburg. In 1863, he entered the
         engineering corps of the army and served until the end of the
         war. After the war, he returned to his tobacco manufacturing
         interests. He also served as a director of the People's
         National Bank, of the Lynchburg Cotton Mill, and of the
         Glamorgan Pipe and Foundry Company. Winfree married first
         Virginia A. Brown (d. 1884) 14 November 1860, and they had 6
         children. He married second Sarah C. Doniphan (b. ca. 1851) 13
         October 1886, and they had no children. Winfree died 18 June
         1902 in Lynchburg, Virginia.</p>
