</head>
<p>The Virginia Freedom of Information Act (Code of Virginia, 2.2-3705.5) and the Virginia Health Records Privacy Act (Code of Virginia, 32.1-172.1:03) establish guidelines for restricting access to medical and other confidential forms of information in order to protect personal privacy.  Protected health information (PHI) as defined under the Privacy Regulations issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) includes, but is not limited to, personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, and social security numbers.  The Virginia Public Records Act (Code of Virginia, 42.1-78) includes a provision for closing all privacy protected information for 75 years from the date of creation.  In accordance with this legislation, the Library of Virginia can and will restrict, in whole or in part, access to any privacy protected medical information or any other confidential information contained in these records.</p>

<p>When possible, privacy protected information has been sealed or redacted (or will be upon request of material), and may be available for research in its altered form.  When redaction is deemed implausible by library staff due to the type, size, or condition of the records, the records will be completely closed.  Absolutely restricted material may include but is not limited to, patient lists, patient admission registers, treatment registers, and personnel files less than 75 years of age.  Please inquire about the restriction status of individual boxes and volumes.  All records more than 75 years old are open for research.  </p>

<p>A patron wishing to access his or her own records will be accommodated, regardless of the age of the record, as long as proof of identity is provided.  Patrons searching for their own records must provide a drivers license or government-issued identification card featuring a photograph.  This identification card will be photocopied and attached to the research agreement.</p>

<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Public Hospital established by legislation in 1788 (Vol. 1790, p. 31, Index to Public Acts) was the premier public mental health facility during its time.  The legislation required a Court of Directors as administrative oversight for the Hospital.  Early staffing at the Hospital consisted of a Keeper, Matron for female patients and a Visiting Physician.</p>

<p>The Hospital at Williamsburg was proposed by Royal Governor Francis Fauquier in 1766 and was founded in the fall of 1773, being noted for its innovative treatment of the mentally ill and for the expectation that the mentally ill could be cured.  Prior to the construction of the Public Hospital, the mentally ill invoked fear in family members and the general community and consequently treatment consisted of incarceration.</p>

<p>The admission policy to enter the hospital was strict.  A magistrate had to issue a warrant ordering the accused insane person to appear before local justices.  If a majority of the justices concluded that a person was insane, they would then appear at a hearing before the Public Hospital's Court of Directors to determine agreement with the local magistrates ruling.  It was at this point that the person could be admitted.  Once admitted, the major goal of the Hospital was the curing and discharging of the patient.  Treatments of the mentally ill consisted of various experimental methods, such as bleedings, blistering, salves, enemas, drugs, water treatments, and the use of various restraining devices.</p>

<p>In 1841 Dr. John M. Galt, II, Superintendent, introduces the Moral Management treatment to the Eastern Lunatic Asylum.  Moral Management suggested that the roots of insanity might be emotional and therefore kindness, along with organized social activity might work better in treating the mentally ill than severe treatments, such as restraints and bleedings.  One of the more controversial concepts (as well as prophetic) of Galt's treatment was the suggestion that the mentally ill should be allowed to pursue work in the community and then return to the hospital to sleep.  In essence, a predecessor of the community based mental health home of today.  Dr. Galt instituted the practice of hiring full-time attendants to work with patients and permitted former patients the opportunity to come back to the facility to work.  Dr. Galt also encouraged slaves to interact socially with white patients.  In 1846 Dr. Galt received legislative consent to accept mentally ill slaves as patients to the hospital.  By 1869, post-Civil War racial segregation of the hospital was re-established.</p>

<p>On June 7, 1885, a major fire swept through the facility killing at least one patient and destroying several buildings.  With the construction of a new facility, the hospital faced a new direction in the housing of patients.  "Warehousing" or custodial care became the focus of the hospital with less expectation of curing the mentally ill.</p>

<p>According to annual reports, Eastern State Hospital has experienced various name changes over the years.  At its establishment in 1788 it was called the Public Hospital.  In 1837, it became known as the Lunatic Hospital at Williamsburg, Virginia.   From 1843-1869 it was called the Eastern Lunatic Asylum and from 1870-1893 it was known as the Eastern Lunatic Asylum of Virginia.  Finally, in 1893 there was a proposal that the word lunatic not be used due to its cruel characterization of the patients, and by 1895 the original Public Hospital was given its current name of Eastern State Hospital.</p>

Some records may require review by an archivist and/or redaction (if it is possible) before they are served. </emph> This series includes a variety of registers that document the financial history of the hospital.  Included are ledgers devoted to particular accounts, such as the building fund, contingent fund and support fund.  Also included are check stub books related to the Additions and Improvements Fund and the Auditor of Public Accounts. Other ledgers contain information on contracts awarded, pay patient funds, steward's sales, transportation and amusement.  The largest subset of financial registers are the general ledgers and general journals.  The general ledgers served as the final accounting of funds received and disbursed. The ledgers provide information on money spent for capital outlay projects, legal expenses, medical supplies, food, amusement, equipment, postage, telephone and telegrams.  Ledgers for more recent years include information on grant monies, accounts such as the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Donation Fund and the Chapel Buildings Fund, and appropriations for the Behavior Modification Program.  In most cases, each general ledger is accompanied by a journal that features more descriptive information about accounts paid and received.  Several of the later general journals are restricted due to the presence of patient names and Medicaid information.  One volume of Building Committee minutes (found in Series IV. Minutes) also contains a record of pay patients and bonds owed the institution for 1866-1869.  Researchers interested in patients' private funds (individual patient spending money), please see Series V. Patient Records.

<p>This series contains a variety of registers related to the inventorying and issuing of food and other items at the hospital, such as daybooks, registers of stores issued and received, requisition and invoice registers, and a farm production register. </p>

<p> The daybooks describe supplies maintained by and issued to particular staff members or units such as the matron, supervisor, chief cook, steward, and drug room or for particular purposes such as housekeeping. Examples of items inventoried include whiskey and wine, various foodstuffs, clothing, toiletries, and tobacco.  Handwritten notations made by the matron or supervisor can be found in some of the earlier daybooks.  </p>

<p>The registers of stores issued contain lists of particular supplies, food and other items that were issued to various staff or hospital units.  These supplies include wagons, utensils, clothing, bedding, personal care items, and food.

<p>This series contains the minutes of the Court/Board of Directors and the Executive Committee, as well as minutes of the Board of Physicians and Building Committee.  The majority of the volumes contain minutes of the Court/Board of Directors.  The history of the Board begins with the Court of Directors which was the original advisory committee that closely supervised the operation of the asylum.  The Court of Directors was later renamed the Board of Directors, and its nine appointed members were required to meet on a quarterly basis.  In 1903, the Board of Directors was replaced by a three-person group called the Special Board of Directors. There may be some overlapping use of older and newer names, but they describe the same basic administrative body.  The first volume of minutes contains a deed for the land on which the original hospital sat, the articles of agreement, and description of the area and original buildings.  In some cases, the minute books have overlapping dates, due to the presence of "rough minutes" in addition to the official minutes of Board meetings.</p> 

<p>Also related to the Board minutes are the minutes of the Executive Committee.  The Executive Committee was composed of a small number of members of the Court of Directors/Board of Directors. The Executive Committee was responsible for reviewing the superintendent's reports, auditing the steward's monthly expense accounts, and overseeing other matters that arose between Board meetings. An index to the Executive Committee minutes exists for the years 1901-1913.</p>  

<p> Additionally, this series contains the minutes of the Board of Physicians, which include patient and treatment information, as well as discussion of hospital business and operations.  Also included are the minutes of the Building Committee (or Committee on Construction), which include records of money spent on construction projects, buildings, grounds and the general maintenance of the hospital structures.  This volume also contains an account of pay patients and bonds, 1866-1869.</p>

Some records may require review by an archivist and/or redaction (if it is possible) before they are served. </emph>  This series contains a variety of registers related to patients and medical treatment at the hospital.</p>

<p>  The registers of patients are divided into three sections: a statistical tally of the number of males and females housed in the hospital for the respective years, lists of individual patient names, addresses, dates admitted and the results of the hospitalizations.  These registers also contain a complete diagnostic diary on individual patients which provide the name of the patient, treatment received and the patient's response.  The volume dated 1859-1861 also contains a Board report for the year 1887 that includes a narrative discussion of the operation of the hospital,patient care, a statistical breakdown of the number of patients by sex and age, and a list of patients who received clothing. </p>

<p> This series also includes account books for the Patients' Private Fund, which was composed of patient spending money held and issued by the superindent.  If a patient was sent money by friends and family, it was not given directly to him or her.  The money was held in the Patients' Private Fund and doled out for personal expenses when necessary.  </p>

<p>Also included in this series are two record books kept by the night watchman of the male department.  These volumes document the activities of the night watchman and describe the number of visits to each ward, the time and temperature of the ward at the time of the visit, as well as the names of patients and their level of "excitement."  Additional registers found in this series include a ledger of articles belonging to patients, which includes a listing of clothing, money, jewelry and other personal effects, and a list of furloughed patients which provides the name of the patient, ward, residence, number of days on furlough, and occasionally includes the reason for the patient's return to the hospital. </p>

<p><emph render="italic">Access to architectural and engineering plans and drawings of current governmental buildings requires written authorization from the appropriate authority within the agency occupying the facility. See the Archives Research Services staff for further information.</emph>  This series contains architectural and engineering plans and drawings for several structures on the grounds of Eastern State Hospital, such as the Montague Building, the superintendent's residence, the laundry and bakery.</p>

<p>The Public Hospital at Williamsburg was constructed from 1771-1773. A third story was added in 1841. In 1885 the building (then known as the Eastern Lunatic Asylum) was destroyed by fire. In 1972, archaeologists from Colonial Williamsburg excavated the foundations. In 1979, reconstruction of the building was begun, using a detail of the 1829 drawing as a primary source of information about the structure. The rebuilt Public Hospital was opened in 1985.</p>

<p> This series also includes a very early elevations and plans for the entire hospital.  Hospital Keeper Dickie Gault (possibly Alexander Dickie Galt) created the drawing at the request of the Governor's office in 1829. Gault was paid out of the hospital treasury for his work. See the Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Report of the Directors of the Lunatic Hospital at Williamsburg, Document No. 12, (Richmond, 1830). A copy of this document is enclosed with the drawing.  </p>

<p>These oversize drawings and plans were separated from the other Eastern State material at some point in the past and were accessioned and arranged as part of the Library of Virginia's General Architectural Files Collection; particular folder numbers are indicated below.  Many of the plans are composed of multiple sheets each.
