<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Elisha Norfleet was born 15 November 1800 in Nansemond County, Virginia, to Christopher Norfleet (ca. 1761-1812) and Clotilda James (ca. 1770-184-), the 5th of 10 children and the 4th of 5 sons. Primarily a farmer, Norfleet amassed a large amount of real estate in the county. By the outbreak of the Civil War, Norfleet owned over 30 slaves. When the Union army occupied Suffolk and Nansemond County, Norfleet moved his family to Henderson, North Carolina, returning to Nansemond at the end of the war. He married Sarah Ann Lassiter (1804-1850) 30 December 1824 and they had 13 children. He then married Sarah Elizabeth Riddick (1833-1910) 20 November 1851 and they had 8 children, including John Ballentine Norfleet (1866-1955) who served as mayor of Suffolk from 1907 to 1911. Elisha Norfleet died 25 December 1869.
