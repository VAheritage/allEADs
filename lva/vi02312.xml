      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><title render="bold">Context of Record type:</title> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.</p> 
     <p><title render="bold">Locality History:</title> Winchester, in Frederick County, was first known as Opequon, then as Frederick's Town (or Fredericktown), and, finally, on establishment as a town in 1752, as Winchester. According to tradition, one of the town's founders, James Wood, named the town in honor of his birthplace in England. Winchester was incorporated as a town in 1779 and as a city in 1874.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Winchester (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1787-1936, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.</p>
<p>The collection also includes chancery suits heard in Frederick County Circuit Court.

          <p>Dispute over ownership of an African American Cemetery located in Winchester. The plaintiffs were members of John Mann Chapel, an African American Methodist Church. They asserted ownership of the cemetery and that only members of their congregation were to be buried in it. The defendants, also African American, claimed ownership of the cemetery stating their right came from the city of Winchester. They argued that the cemetery was to be for the burial of all African Americans regardless of religious affiliation. The plaintiffs accused the defendants of illegally taking possession of the cemetery to bury deceased individuals not affiliated with the church and keeping the burial fees for themselves. See also Frederick County Chancery Cause 1849-004 which involves the Grim family. The plaintiffs reference a decree from this case in their bill of complaint.
