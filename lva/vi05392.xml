<emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph>Business Records, both volumes and loose records, are in some cases transferred to the Library of Virginia as components of court record transfers. These business records in some cases were simply stored in the local court building for safe keeping by business owners. In other cases, business records (particularly ledgers, account books, etc.) may have been filed in a court case as an exhibit. These business record exhibits appeared both in chancery causes and in judgments, these records serving as exhibits for business dissolution cases, debt suits, and contract disputes.
</p>
<p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph>: Chesterfield County was named for Philip Dormer Stanhope, fourth earl of Chesterfield, British statesman and diplomat, and was formed from Henrico County in 1749. The county seat is Chesterfield Court House. Part of Henrico County was added to Chesterfield in 1922. Area: 425.8 square miles. Population: 259,903 (2000), 286,500 (2005 estimate.)

It was organized "for the purpose of promoting, fostering, and encouraging the business of marketing tobacco cooperatively: for reducing speculation; for stabilizing the local tobacco markets; for cooperatively and collectively handling the problems of tobacco growers, and for other pertinent purposes."</p>
<p><emph render="bold">Scope and Content:</emph>Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association Contract Book, 1923-1925, contains the names of farmers in Chesterfield County, Va., who signed contracts to market their tobacco cooperatively through the association. The contracts contain the farmer's address (name of community), the date of the contract, the number of pounds, type of tobacco (dark or bright) pledged, and the amount of acreage in production. Index included. The book also contains a printed agreement with the Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, 1924, outlining terms of marketing agreements with farmers; and three signed affidavits of M.O. Wilson, Secretary of the Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association, 1924.
