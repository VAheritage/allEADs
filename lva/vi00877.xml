<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>George William Smith was born in 1762 at Bathurst, Essex County, to Meriwether Smith and Alice Lee, Meriwether's first wife and the widow of Thomas Clarke. Meriwether Smith was a prominent politician having
served in the Continental Congress and as a representative of Essex County in the House of Burgesses, Committee of Safety, Virginia Conventions, and House of Delegates. George William, a lawyer, followed his
father into politics representing Essex County in the House of Delegates from 1790 to 1793 and Richmond City from 1801 to 1802. Smith was also elected to represent Richmond City at the 1807-1808 session, but his
election was successfully contested by John H. Foushee.
</p>
<p>On 15 December 1807, Smith became a member of the Council of State, elected as president of that body on 20 March 1809 to replace Alexander Stuart. Smith was reelected as president of the Council on 1 January
1810 and again on 2 January 1811. During this time, Smith was twice called on to assume the duties as lieutenant governor and acting governor. His first stint as acting governor occurred as a result of the
resignation of Governor John Tyler on 15 January 1811 to become a judge of the United States District Court for Virginia. Shortly thereafter, James Monroe was elected governor on 19 January 1811 leaving Smith with
his duties in the Council of State. Monroe too resigned on 3 April 1811 in order to accept his appointment by President James Madison as Secretary of State. In the absence of the General Assembly, Smith again
became acting governor for eight months until the legislature reconvened and elected him governor on 5 December 1811. Smith's tenure as governor, however, was cut short upon his death in the Richmond Theater fire
on 26 December 1811. Peyton Randolph, a member of the Council of State, succeeded Smith as acting governor until the election of James Barbour on 4 January 1812.
</p>
<p>George William Smith married Sarah Adams, daughter of Col. Richard Adams of Richmond, on 7 February 1793. The couple had eight children. Sarah died on 30 September 1806, and George William later remarried to
Jane Read Jones, widow of Meriwether Jones. Smith is buried in Monumental Church in Richmond, Virginia, which was built on the site of the Richmond Theater.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>George William Smith's Executive papers primarily consist of incoming correspondence during his term as lieutenant governor acting as governor as a result of the resignation of James Monroe from 3 April 1811
until 6 December. There is a small amount of papers during his brief term as governor from 6 December until his death in the Richmond Theater fire on 26 December. In addition, there are a few papers while Peyton
Randolph served until James Barbour's appointment as governor on 4 January 1812. These papers are arranged chronologically with pardons arranged to the rear. The correspondence in this collection relates to a
variety of topics including appointments &amp; recommendations for state positions; prisoners &amp; the Virginia Penitentiary; arms &amp; the Virginia Manufactory of Arms; the Public Guard; the militia; a public
tobacco warehouse on the canal of the Upper Appomattox Company; repairs to the Capitol; housing for the Governor; public improvements; the Erie Canal; resignations; state expenses &amp; revenue; and others. In
addition to correspondence, there are resolutions from the Virginia Senate &amp; House of Delegates; accounts; oaths; muster rolls; pardons; proposals; receipts; election returns &amp; architectural drawings;
certificates; qualifications; petitions; reports; appointments; resignations; bonds; commissions; orders; proceedings; applications; and other sundry items.
</p>
<p>The Governor received correspondence from three main sources: the Federal government, Virginia State government, and Governors from other states. Federal government correspondents include James Monroe,
Secretary of State, and William Eustis, Secretary of War. On 3 April 1811, James Monroe writes Lieutenant Governor Smith regarding his acceptance of an appointment by the president as Secretary of State. Monroe
also writes regarding a land bounty warrant improperly issued to William Goodman (1811 May 1). Monroe transmits a copy of the Third Census of the United States on 26 November 1811. Lastly, Monroe transmits an act
for the appointment of Representatives among the several states according to the third enumeration (1811 Dec. 27). As Secretary of War, William Eustis requests a duplicate copy of the list of officers &amp;
soldiers of the Virginia Line on Continental Establishment which was destroyed in a fire at the War Office (1811 May 17). On 13 Dec. 1811, William Burns encloses a letter from Eustis to Alexander Quarrier
regarding transporting military stores belonging to the United States to Norfolk.
</p>
<p>The majority of correspondence in George W. Smith's Executive Papers originates from Virginia State government. Significant correspondents from Virginia State government include John Staples, Superintendent of
the Virginia Manufactory of Arms; Peter Crutchfield, Commandant of the Public Guard; Abraham Douglas, Keeper of the Penitentiary; Philip N. Nicholas, Attorney General; William Munford, Clerk of the House of
Delegates; and Samuel Shepard, Auditor of Public Accounts.
</p>
<p>John Staples, as Superintendent of the Virginia Manufactory of Arms, corresponded frequently with the Governor regarding arms and the Manufactory in Richmond, Virginia. Staples encloses monthly statements of
the operations of the Manufactory from April to December 1811. Most of these statements were prepared by William Banks. Staples also writes regarding the claim of Thomas Hume for inspecting arms repaired by Robert
Stewart (1811 May 18); a list of arms distributed from 1 Dec. 1810 to 31 Oct. 1811 (1811 Oct. 31); and Alexander Quarrier's account with the Commonwealth for gun carriages (1811 Nov. 9). In his letter of 6 June
1811, Staples requests a visit to Harper's Ferry in order to introduce the manufacture of musket locks to the Virginia Manufactory of Arms. Staples also encloses a letter from John McLean, New York, regarding
cannon. In Staples' absence, George Williamson encloses a statement of arms on hand and ready for delivery (1811 June 19). In addition, Staples served on a committee consisting of Christopher Tompkins, Anderson
Barret, &amp; George Winston to determine the necessary repairs to the Capitol. The committee writes the governor on 30 May 1811 detailing problems with the Capitol Building.
</p>
<p>Peter Crutchfield, Commandant of the Public Guard, provides monthly returns of arms &amp; accoutrements belonging to the Public Guard, monthly reports of the daily duties performed by the Public Guard, and
monthly muster rolls from April to December 1811. These monthly reports are filed at the end of each month. Note that the monthly reports for October are missing.
</p>

George Miller &amp; Benjamin Foster (1811 July 18); nails (1811 Aug. 22); and a statement of ammunition belonging to the Commonwealth (1811 Dec. 27). Additionally, William Anderson, Agent to the Penitentiary,
writes regarding his claim on 15 August 1811. Anderson encloses Auditor's accounts, Treasurer's accounts, and an inventory of articles on hand by Douglas.
</p>
<p>Philip Norborne Nicholas, Attorney General, writes regarding the manner in which bonds &amp; recognizance are taken (1811 April 21); a deed to John Chandler &amp; a bond from his securities for land purchased

26). The Attorney General also provides opinions on the demand of a fugitive in North Carolina (1811 April 4); commissions &amp; obtaining arms from militia companies no longer in existence (1811 Aug. 27); and the
appointment of sheriffs (1811 Oct. 9).
</p>
<p>William Munford, as Clerk of the House of Delegates, often submits legislation to the Governor. Noteworthy, is a resolution to wear black crape in memory of Governor Smith and the other citizens who died in the
Richmond Theater fire (1811 Dec. 28). Additionally, Munford transmits extracts from the House Journal regarding the election of John Coalter as judge of the Supreme Court of Appeals to supply the vacancy
occasioned by the resignation of St. George Tucker (1811 Dec. 6).
</p>
<p>Samuel Shepard, Auditor of Public Accounts, corresponds with Governor Smith regarding various financial matters. Shepard regularly encloses accounts of expenses for forwarding notices, executions, etc. (1811
May 4, 1811 July 8, &amp; 1811 Oct. 11). In addition, Shepard writes concerning a list of counties where there have been no collectors of the revenue (1811 April 5); executions against John Currence &amp; Samuel
Bermfield for the militia fines of 1808 (1811 April 5), the account between Robert Stewart &amp; the Commonwealth for repairing arms (1811 April 23); the collector of taxes in Norfolk Borough (1811 May 11);

11); additional warrants drawn on the Contingent Fund (1811 Nov. 15); a motion against Joseph Sequine as Sheriff of Norfolk County (1811 Nov. 26); and the account of the tax of 1810 for the Borough of Norfolk
