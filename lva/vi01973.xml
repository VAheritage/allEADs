      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>David Jameson was the third-born son of James and Margaret Jameson, residents of St. Anne's Parish, Essex County, Virginia. Jameson's exact date of birth is unknown, but his elder brother James was born in 1720. A graduate of Princeton College, Jameson became a prominent merchant in Yorktown involved in shipping tobacco, importing goods, and buying and selling slaves. An inventor who developed the first instrument to measure dew and rainfall, Jameson was named treasurer of the Society for the Advancement of Useful Knowledge, an organization he helped organize with John Clayton &amp; John Page in Williamsburg. Elected to represent the district of Elizabeth City, Warwick, and York counties in the state senate in 1776, 1781, 1782, &amp; 1783, Jameson instead accepted an appointment to the Council of State and was sworn in on 12 December 1776. Jameson served on the Council for over five years with an increased role as lieutenant governor during the formidable period leading up to the capitulation of Lord Cornwallis after the siege of Yorktown. During Governor Thomas Nelson's absence to command the Virginia militia at Yorktown, Jameson handled the essential duties of the office including supplying the French &amp; American armies with equipment &amp; supplies for the coming battle. Upon Nelson's resignation on 22 November 1781, Jameson served briefly as acting governor until Benjamin Harrison's appointment on 30 November 1781. Jameson continued on the Council until his resignation on 30 March 1782. Jameson returned to the state senate for the October to December 1782 session and the subsequent session in 1783. He was also served as justice of the peace &amp; coroner for York County in 1782 &amp; 1783.Jameson married Mildred Smith (1733-1778), daughter of Edmund &amp; Agnes Sclater Smith. Jameson's exact date of death is unknown but his will was probated on 22 July 1793. Jameson left no issue, but bequeathed his portions of his estate to his nephews John Jameson, David Jameson of Culpeper, &amp; David Jameson of Caroline.
