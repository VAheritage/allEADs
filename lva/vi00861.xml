      <head>Historical Information</head>
      <p>Capitol Square in Richmond, Virginia, originated from an
         act of the General Assembly passed in May 1779 for the removal
         of the seat of government from Williamsburg to Richmond. This
         act also provided that five Directors of Public Buildings be
         appointed to procure six squares in Richmond for a Capitol
         Building, Hall of Justice, Governor's House, Executive Boards,
         and Public Market. The first five Directors of Public
         Buildings included James Buchanan, Archibald Cary, Robert
         Goode, Robert Carter Nicholas, and Turner Southall. In May
         1780, an act was passed choosing Shockoe Hill as the location
         for these buildings and adding four additional Directors:
         Richard Adams, Samuel DuVal, Thomas Jefferson, and Edmund
         Randolph. An act passed in October 1784 authorized the
         Directors to provide a single building to house the
         legislative, executive, and judicial branches of state
         government. The Directors asked Jefferson in 1785 to submit a
         plan for the Capitol. Jefferson, serving as minister to
         France, chose the Maison Carree in Nismes, France, as a model
         and had drawings made by the French architect Charles-Louis
         Clerisseau and a plaster model sent to Virginia. The
         cornerstone for the Capitol was laid on 18 August 1785 and the
         General Assembly held its first session in the building on 20
         October 1788. Samuel Dobie, Surveyor of Public Buildings,
         superintended the construction which continued until 1798.
         Slight alterations and repairs occurred over the years,
         especially by Orris Paine as Superintendent of Public
         Improvements in 1816. Repairs were also necessary following a
         tragic event on 27 April 1870, when sixty-two people died as
         the ceiling collapsed during a session of the Court of
         Appeals. The most significant alterations in the Capitol
         Building, however, occurred on 1 August 1904, when the east
         and west wings were added to the original structure.</p>
      <p>Another significant milestone for Capitol Square occurred
         when an act passed on 13 February 1811 authorizing the
         construction of a Governor's house. Prior to this act, a house
         owned by Thomas Turpin was rented for the use of the governor
         in 1780 near the corner of Broad and Governor streets. Shortly
         thereafter, a four-room house was eventually purchased from
         James Marsden and served as the executive's residence until
         the present structure was built and occupied by Governor James
         Barbour in March 1813. Christopher Tompkins served as
         undertaker or contractor for the construction of the house
         based on plans purchased by a Boston architect named Alexander
         Parris.</p>
      <p>In addition to the Capitol Building and Governor's Mansion,
         several other buildings were constructed in Capitol Square
         over the years. In 1816, James Warrell received permission to
         build a Museum on the southeastern portion of the square. A
         Bell Tower, which housed the Public Guard, was erected in 1824
         by Levi Swain. A State Courthouse was added around 1847 to
         house the Court of Appeals, General Court, and Superior Court
         of Chancery. Other buildings constructed on Capitol Square
         include the Finance Building (formerly the State Library
         Building) (1893-1894), the State Office Building (1923-1924),
         and the Library - Supreme Court Building (1939-1940).</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Capitol Square Data Records are arranged in four
         series. Series have been designated for Buildings, Grounds,
         Statues, and the Superintendent of Public Buildings. These
         records represent an artificial collection of documents
         compiled from the Auditor of Public Accounts, Governor's
         Office, General Assembly, Land Office, and other state
         agencies. Even though the collection was gathered from various
         state records, it is considered part of the Auditor of Public
         Accounts (APA# 655) since most of the records originate from
         this agency. Note that not all documents relevant to Capitol
         Square, especially late 19th and 20th century records, are
         located in this collection. Researchers should consult the
         records of other state agencies for additional resources
         related to Capitol Square.</p>
      <p>The Capitol Square Data began as six volumes of documents
         transcribed by Virginia W. Gibbon under the direction of the
         Archives Division of the Virginia State Library between 1931
         and 1932. These volumes were created for W.W. Savedge,
         Superintendent of the Division of Grounds and Buildings, and
         contain transcriptions from numerous sources including
         Journals of the House of Delegates, Hening's Statutes,
         Executive Papers, Executive Communications, Enrolled Bills,
         newspapers, magazines, and various manuscripts "on file in the
         Archive Dept. of the Virginia State Library." Note that some,
         but not all, of these manuscripts can be found among the
         Capitol Square Data Records. Volumes were created for the
         Capitol Building (vol. 1), Grounds, Property Acquisition,
         Placing of Buildings, etc. (vol. 2), Statues (vol. 3), Bell
         Tower, et al. (vol. 4), State Office Building, et al. (vol.
         5), and the Governor's Mansion (vol. 6). The series
         designations used in the current rearrangement of the Capitol
         Square Data Records are based on these volumes with volumes 1,
         4, 5, &amp; 6 representing Series I: Buildings, volume 2 as
         Series II: Grounds, volume 3 as Series III: Statues, and a
         fourth series devoted to Superintendent of Public Buildings
         records.</p>
      <p>In 1959, Marvin D. Evans prepared a partial inventory of
         sources in the Archives Division pertaining to Capitol Square.
         Evans' inventory includes a bibliography of archival sources
         from the Calendar of Transcripts (1905) and manuscripts
         deposited by the State Auditor in 1914 (Auditor Items 137
         &amp; 203). His inventory consists of 20 boxes of archival
         material which were divided into General Sources (Boxes 1-
         11), Governor's Mansion (Boxes 12-15), Washington Monument
         (Boxes 16-19), Capitol Building (Plans, 1858 &amp; 1904-1905),
         State Office Building (Plans, 1923), Finance Building (Acc.#
         24811a), and Houdon Statue of Washington (Box 20). The General
         Sources have been reassigned to Series I through IV in this
         finding aid. The Governor's Mansion records are located in
         Series I: Buildings, Subseries B, Governor's Mansion. Items
         related to the Washington Monument will be arranged as a
         separate collection since they are considered part of the
         Washington Monument Fund and given a distinct entry in the
         Auditor of Public Accounts Inventory (APA# 668). The
         Governor's Office, Capitol Building, and State Office Building
         plans can be found with the Architectural Drawings and Plans
         Collection. Finally, the Finance Building materials contain
         Construction Records for the Old State Library Building,
         1892-1896, and are considered part of the Treasurer's Office
         (See Acc.# 24811a).</p>

            <p>This subseries documents the construction,
                  alteration, additions, and repair of the Capitol
                  Building between 1779 and 1933. Volume 1 of the
                  Capitol Square Data documents well the legislative
                  history of the Capitol Building beginning with the
                  relocation of the Capitol from Williamsburg to
                  Richmond. In addition, the volume provides
                  information on the Capitol Disaster on 27 April 1870
                  including a list of casualties, the purchase of
                  Sycamore Church for the use of the Courts in 1870,
                  the enlargement of the Capitol in 1906, and the
                  unveiling of various busts in the Old Hall of the
                  House of Delegates. Particularly interesting is a
                  report of John H. Smith in 1832 which describes the
                  historic books and papers housed in the upper story
                  of the Capitol.</p>
            <p>The bulk of this subseries, however, consists of
                  financial records including accounts, receipts, and
                  vouchers. The accounts and receipts primarily relate
                  to expenses incurred by Edward Voss, Samuel Dobie,
                  and Dabney Minor during the construction of the
                  Capitol between 1786 and 1794. The numbered vouchers
                  document the expenses paid by William Hay, one of the
                  Directors of Public Buildings, to Voss, Dobie, and
                  others for flooring, laborers, supplies, etc.,
                  between 1787 and 1790. The unnumbered vouchers relate
                  to numerous expenses between 1784 and 1865. The later
                  vouchers mainly deal with painting and repairs.</p>
            <p>The Executive Communications and Executive Papers
                  in this subseries have been photocopied and the
                  originals returned to their respective collections.
                  The Executive Communications relate to documents
                  transmitted by the Directors of Public Buildings in
                  1792 and 1796. The Communication dated 1 Oct. 1792
                  regards the failure of Moses Austin &amp; Co. to
                  fulfill their roofing contract. Included is an
                  extract from the Council Journal by Archibald Blair,
                  Clerk of the Council, and proceedings of the
                  Directors of Public Buildings extracted by Samuel
                  Coleman, Assistant Clerk of the Council. Another
                  Communication, dated 12 Nov. 1792, is from Robert
                  Goode, one of the Directors of Public Buildings. In
                  his letter, Goode writes with respect to the
                  settlement of accounts, the contract of Moses Austin
                  &amp; Co., and the settlement of several other
                  accounts. The last Communication, dated 9 Dec. 1796,
                  consists of a letter from Governor James Wood to the
                  Speaker of the House of Delegates enclosing papers
                  from the Directors of Public Buildings including
                  accounts of expenditures, a report of proceedings,
                  and an estimate of the expense of finishing the
                  outside of the Capitol.</p>
            <p>The Executive Papers (previously labeled
                  Correspondence, 1790) in this subseries include
                  letters to Governors Beverley Randolph and James Wood
                  from the Directors of Public Buildings. On 11 May
                  1790, William Hay wrote Gov. Randolph concerning
                  Samuel Dobie's allowance as Surveyor of the Public
                  Buildings and his roofing contract. Later, on 22 June
                  1790, Hay writes the Governor regarding Edward Voss'
                  contract for the columns of the Capitol portico.
                  Finally, the Directors write the Governor on 5 Feb.
                  1798 enclosing a copy of a report with a general
                  account and transactions made in 1796.</p>

                  on the Capitol Building including a painting contract
                  and roofing contract. The painting contract of
                  Zachariah Enos and John Whitburn between 1816 and
                  1820 contains accounts, correspondence, measurements,
                  and a report on Enos and Whitburn's account. The
                  roofing contract of Adam Baird and Andrew Hosia in
                  1806 consists of a power of attorney and judgment
                  from their claim in covering the Capitol roof with
                  slate commenced on 25 October 1796.</p>

            <p>This subseries documents the construction,
                  furnishing, and repair of the Governor's Mansion and
                  gardens between 1779 and 1971. Volume 6 of the
                  Capitol Square Data includes warrants for repairs and
                  furniture, an inventory of furnishings from 1825,
                  drawings of mantles in 1830, and disbursements for
                  repairs in 1849.</p>
            <p>Like the Capitol Building subseries, this
                  subseries mostly includes vouchers for furnishings
                  and work done on the Governor's Mansion between 1783
                  and 1864. In addition, this subseries includes
                  numerous inventories of furnishings compiled between
                  1785 and 1878. Correspondence and estimates from 1830
                  relate to work on the Governor's Mansion.
                  Correspondence addressed to William H. Richardson
                  includes drawings of mantels from Henry C. Carey of
                  Philadelphia, the purchase of glassware from the
                  Jersey Glass Co., and others. The estimates relate to
                  carpentry work, furniture, and other expenses.</p>
            <p>The Executive Communications and Executive Papers
                  in this subseries have also been photocopied and the
                  originals returned to their respective collections.
                  The Executive Communications relate to documents
                  transmitted by the Directors of Public Buildings in
                  1791, 1794, &amp; 1800. All three communications
                  concern houses appropriated for the use of the
                  Governor. The earliest document is a letter from
                  William Hay to Thomas Mathews, Speaker of the House
                  of Delegates, dated 1791 Nov. 9. This letter remarks
                  on the poor condition of the houses and an estimate
                  by Dabney Minor for a new kitchen, stable, and coach
                  house. The second communication is from Robert Goode
                  to John Wise, Speaker of the House, dated 1794 Dec.
                  2. This letter too relates to the condition of the
                  houses appropriated for the Governor and the cost for
                  repairs. The last communication consists of a report
                  by Richard Adams, William Foushee, and Robert
                  Mitchell, Directors of Public Buildings, dated 1800
                  Jan. 11, to the Speaker. This report includes an
                  estimate for repairs to the houses appropriated for
                  the use of the Governor, a list of furniture
                  delivered by George Brooke, and a list of necessary
                  furniture with costs.</p>
            <p>The Executive Papers in this subseries include
                  letters to Governors James Monroe and George William
                  Smith in 1811. The first document consists of a memo
                  of agreement, dated 1811 March 1, between William
                  Moncure and A.B. Venable, et al., acting as
                  commissioners, for the rent of his dwelling house and
                  grounds for the use of the Governor. The second
                  Executive Paper is a letter, dated 1811 May 6, from
                  Robert Greenhow, one of the Commissioners to Dispose
                  of Certain Public Property, regarding renting a house
                  for the Governor. The third Executive Paper is a
                  letter from Edward Cunningham, dated 1811 May 15,
                  also related to the rental of Moncure's home.</p>
            <p>The Grounds and Narrative Report contains a report
                  of a program for the development and maintenance of
                  the grounds of the Executive Mansion by Stanley W.
                  Abbott, Landscape Architect, in 1971. The report
                  includes a blueprint showing suggested revisions for
                  the gardens and grounds of the Mansion.</p>
            <p>Lastly, there are miscellaneous records related to
                  repairs of the Governor's Mansion between 1914 and
                  1918. Included are proceedings of the Commission on
                  Repairs to the Governor's House awarding a contract
                  to the J.C. Beazley Co. (Richmond, Va.). This file
                  also contains correspondence from Cuthbert Homan and
                  insurance policies for rugs, carpets, etc., at N. 1st
                  St., and on betterments and improvements made to the
                  Mansion.</p>

          <p>This series chronicles the landscaping, enclosure,
               stonework, and acquisition of property in Capitol
               Square. Volume 2 of the Capitol Square Data includes an
               act for locating the public squares and to enlarge the
               town of Richmond, a report of Carter Braxton from the
               committee to confer with the Directors of Public
               Buildings regarding their opinion to favor the lots on
               Shockoe Hill instead of Richmond Hill, an act to
               contract some persons for regulating the surface of
               Capitol Square in 1816, and a letter from Thomas Giles,
               Member of the Committee on Capitol Square, providing a
               legislative history of Capitol Square in 1852.</p>
          <p>An important component of this series are the
               inquisitions dated from 1781 to 1788. The inquisitions
               include writs of quod damnum by the state for
               acquisition of the property located between Broad &amp;
               Main Streets and 9th &amp; 12th Streets. The
               inquisitions are arranged alphabetically by lot owner
               and include a plan presented to the library in 1926 by
               the City Engineer's Office which provides the names of
               the lot owners and lot numbers. A bound photostat copy
               of the inquisitions and map can also be found in this
               series. Related correspondence from S. Bassett French to
               Samuel P. Waddill, clerk of the Henrico County Court, in
               1876 concerns the six "lost" lots in Capitol Square.</p>
          <p>Contracts in this series relate to earthmoving and
               landscaping, erecting a fence around Capitol Square, and
               stonework. John P. Shields contracted with the state
               between 1817 and 1820 for earthmoving and landscaping. A
               file in this series contains correspondence from Shields
               to the Governor and Council. Paul A. Sabbaton was
               awarded the contract with the state to enclose Capitol
               Square with an iron fence in 1817. Sabbaton often wrote
               Orris Paine and enclosed a draft of a brace to support
               the cast iron railing. There are also proposals for the
               fence submitted between 1816 and 1817, some of which
               include sketches. James Kinkead received a contract to
               furnish granite stone steps for the Capitol. Memos of
               agreement and correspondence to A.S. Brockenbrough,
               Superintendent of the Improvement of the Public Square,
               can also be found in this file. Kinkead died before the
               work could be completed and another contract was granted
               to George C. Longden. Longden was also contracted in
               1816 to remove the rock on the east side of the Capitol
               and lay a stone wall surrounding the Governor's lot or
               Capitol Square.</p>
          <p>Lastly, this series contains documents related to the
               sale of land adjoining the Governor's lot from the heirs
               of Gustavus V. Clarke in 1857. Included is the opinion
               of Attorney General J.R. Tucker, a copy of Clarke's
               will, and a map of the property at the corner of
               Franklin St. and 13th St. (a.k.a. Governor's St.).
               Negative photostats of deeds between 1785 and 1862 for
               property at Capitol Square are also in this series.
               These deeds were copied from Henrico County and City of
               Richmond deed books. There is one Executive Paper
               belonging to Governor James Barbour, however, this
               document is missing. According to the endorsement page,
               the letter was from David Bullock regarding the removal
               of wooden houses in the public lot from 1812. Finally, a
               letter from Richard Young relates to the construction of
               a reservoir on the east side of the Capitol in 1827.</p>

          <p>This series relates to statues on Capitol Square and
               elsewhere in the City of Richmond. Volume 3 of the
               Capitol Square Data includes documents regarding the
               history and value of the Houdon Statue from 1873, a
               bronze copy of Houdon's statue of Washington for France
               in 1910, the Washington Monument Fund and architect
               Robert Mills, and a biography of Thomas Crawford in
               1908, artist for the Equestrian Statue of Washington.
               For additional records on the Equestrian Statue of
               Washington, researchers should consult the Washington
               Monument Fund (APA 668).</p>
          <p>The Executive Papers of Gov. Joseph Johnson include a
               petition from twelve members of the General Assembly
               regarding plaster casts of the Houdon Statue to be
               placed in state colleges and a letter concerning the
               same from W.J. Hubard to George W. Munford, Secretary of
               the Commonwealth. Lastly, there is a letter and receipt
               from G. Blagden to Joseph Huddlestone regarding an
               inscription engraved on the pedestal of the Houdon
               Statue in 1813.</p>

          <p>This series documents the work of the Superintendent
               of Public Buildings and its various incarnations
               including Superintendent of Public Edifices, the
               Superintendent for the Improvement of the Public Square,
               etc. This series mostly consists of reports of the
               Superintendent from 1819 until 1850. These reports to
               the governor provide the best narrative on the work done
               to Capitol Square during this time period. The reports
               relate to a variety of subjects including leaks in the
               Capitol Building, repairs, the Bell Tower, the
               Governor's Stable and Mansion, Museum, etc. In addition
               to public buildings, the reports also concern arms and
               ammunition, the Public Guard, and the Armory. Noteworthy
               is a report of 15 June 1841 which includes a drawing of
               the Capitol Building depicting the skylight. During this
               time, several individuals served as Superintendent
               including Claiborne W. Gooch, Adjutant General
               (1819-1820); Capt. Blair Bolling, Superintendent of
               Public Property/Edifices (1821-1839); Lt. E. Brown,
               Public Guard (1839); John B. Richardson, Superintendent
               of Public Buildings (1839-1843); and Charles Dimmock,
               Superintendent of Public Buildings (1844-1850).</p>
          <p>This series also contains applications and
               recommendations to Gen. W.C. Newberry, while he served
               as Superintendent of Public Buildings. These records,
               which date between 1869 and 1872, document individuals'
               requests for positions in Capitol Square including
               Capitol Police, janitors, watchmen, and others.</p>
          <p>Orris Paine, was appointed by Governor Wilson Cary
               Nicholas in July 1816 as Superintendent relative to the
               repairing of the Capitol, improving the Public Square,
               and building the Governor's stable. Paine kept files
               containing account books, correspondence, accounts, and
               receipts. Paine often wrote the Governor with respect to
               repairs to the Capitol, accounts, and other topics. The
               correspondence also includes memos of agreement with
               A.S. Brockenbrough who served as Superintendent of the
               Improvement of the Public Square.</p>
          <p>Two files labeled "miscellaneous" contain contracts,
               correspondence, accounts, receipts, vouchers, etc.,
               between 1874 and 1879. These documents seem to originate
               from the Register of the Land Office who also served as
               Superintendent of Public Buildings beginning in 1874.
               These materials relate to sundry purchases, roofing the
               State Courthouse, renting the old Armory Building,
               furnishing coal for state buildings, and purchasing
               boilers for the Capitol Building from the Tredegar Iron
               Works.</p>
