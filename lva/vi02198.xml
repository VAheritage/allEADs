</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Starting in 2023, Library of Virginia archival staff in partnership with the Virginia Untold Project Manager began efforts to describe records related to free and enslaved Black and multiracial people in a manner that improved the historical context of the records. In doing so, in some cases material once described within the "Free and Enslaved" record group for a locality may no longer be described within this record. When this has occurred, please see the Processing Information and Related Materials section for records that have been described separately.</emph></p>
<p>These records have been processed by LVA staff for the purposes of digitizing them for the digital project Virginia Untold: The African American Narrative.

<p>Northampton County Free and Enslaved Records are believed to have been removed from Northampton County (Va.) Judgments by LVA staff around 2007.</p>
<p>Apprenticeship Indentures were removed from this record in July 2024 and are now described in Northampton County (Va.) Apprenticeship Indentures, 1727-1748.</p>

</p>
      <p>The Free and Enslaved Records collection is comprised of miscellaneous records related to the regulation and policing of both enslaved and free Black and Multiracial people in Orange County. The localities/local government authorities were largely responsible for enforcing laws that restricted the movement of enslaved and free Black and multiracial people and the resulting documentation was often filed in the circuit courts. The ways in which local authorities enacted legal measures against or on behalf of enslaved and free Black and multiracial people varied from locality to locality; therefore, records were not necessarily standardized or filed and retained in a consistent manner. This collection is topical and a means by which to compile miscellaneous documents related to free and enslaved people that are not established local government record types.

<p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Northampton County was named probably for the English county, of which Obedience Robins, a prominent early resident of the Eastern Shore, was a native. The county, which originally included all of the peninsula south of Maryland and which was one of the eight shires, or counties, first enumerated in 1634, was first called Accomack. The General Assembly changed the name to Northampton County in 1643. Accomack County was created from Northampton County about 1663, but in October 1670, the General Assembly temporarily reunited the two counties as Northampton County. In November 1673, Accomack County was again separated from Northampton. The county seat is Eastville.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Northampton County (Va.) Free and Enslaved Records, 1737-1860, consist of “Free Negro” Tax records, 1804, 1807, Judgments, 1855-1859, Patrol Records, 1806-1808, Tax and Fiscal Records, 1757, and additional records of various types, 1737-1860.
</p>
      <p>“Free Negro” Tax Records, 1804, 1807, are comprised of “Free negroes owing levies,” 1804, and a list of “insolvent free negroes,” 1807. The list of “Free negroes owning levies” includes the names of 61 free Black and multiracial individuals. Beside several names, former enslavers or familial relationship are documented. The list of “insolvent free negroes,” includes the names of six or seven emancipated individuals who owed taxes. Former enslavers are listed alongside the names of several individuals. The back of the document directs that the free individuals are “to be sold for Taxer.”
</p>
<p>Judgments, 1855-1859, include petitions, in which Hiram H. Griffith, administrator of Robert F. Williams, sought to sell the child of Lucy, a woman enslaved by Williams’ estate and Luther Nottingham, guardian of John Wilkins and Delitha Wilkins, sought to sell George, as well as orders permitting Robert Wilkins, Francis Rolley, John Fox, and John W. Elliott to sell Scylla; Leonard N. Nottingham and George F. Wilkins to sell Smith, who belonged to Maria Joynes, widow of Edward Baptist; John Wilkins, guardian of Rebecca S. Wilkins and George T. Wilkins, to sell Laura (or Lauren); and an order ratifying the sale of Jacob by Azariah Thurston, guardian of William Fitchett, to Elijah Brittingham.</p>
<p>Patrol Records, 1806-1808, include patrol accounts and one patrol appointment. These patrols generally acted as the policing force that monitored the movement of free and enslaved Black and multiracial individuals. The records usually document the names of the individuals on patrol; who authorized their patrol; dates of patrol; the number of hours on patrol; general geographic area patrolled; and compensation awarded.</p>
<p>Tax and Fiscal Records, 1757, include a petition by Arthur Robins, who sought to avoid paying taxes on an enslaved woman “past her labour” and unable to work. </p>
<p>Additional single items relating to the documentation of free and enslaved Black and multiracial individuals in and around Goochland County, Va., include:</p>
<p>An account, 1758, in which James Peterkin claimed that James Anderson, a “free Negroe,” owed him compensation for time run away, as well as time lost, cash paid to John Leatherman “in Bringing you from Accomak,” and for “my personal Expenses [going] after you to Same place.”</p>
<p>A claim, 1737, submitted by Esau Jacob, who asserted that Rhodie, an enslaved girl granted him as part of the distribution of John Jacob’s estate, had been freed because Ann Toyer, her mother, was judged to be free. Jacob sought compensation for the loss of Rhodie.

<p>An order, 1860, certifying Mary Stevens’ heritage and status as a “free person of mixed blood.” Based on proof provided by John Kendall and other white citizens, it was determined that Stevens descended from the Gingaskin Tribe of Virginia Indians and was therefore “not a negro.” The order also includes a sentence instructing that Louisa Rozelle, a “free Negroe,” be hired out.</p>
<p>An order, 1860, restricting the movement of the enslaved and free Black and multiracial communities. It established a curfew that could only be circumvented with “the lawful permission of said owner or hirer” and authorized all magistrates of the county to detain any offenders.</p>
<p>A receipt, 1755, for payment given to Daniel Stephens by Garner Crosely and Thomas Drighouse for “keeping one Negro Boy one year.”</p>
<p>A warrant, 1738, issued in order to detain Riah (also referred to Uriah), enslaved by Gertrude Harmonson, and Secer (also spelled Cesar), enslaved by Josephas Meriah Johnson. Susannah Powell claimed that Riah and Secer wrongfully transported Meriom and her two children, who were enslaved by Powell, into Accomack County and left them in the custody of Isaac Smith.</p>
