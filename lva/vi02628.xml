      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Isle of Wight County was most likely named for the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England. It was first known as Warrosquyoake Shire, after the Warrosquyoake people (an Algonquian speaking nation that formed part of the Powhatan Confederacy) who were the original care takers of the land before being forcibly removed by English colonizers. Warrosquyoake was one of the eight shires established in 1634. The present name was given in 1637. Part of Nansemond County was added in 1769.
</p>
<p> Most pre–Revolutionary War–era loose records are missing. Volumes that record deeds, court orders, and wills exist. During the Civil War, the county clerk had Randall Boothe, a Black man he enslaved, transport the court records to Greensville and Brunswick counties for safekeeping. After the war ended, Boothe returned the records to Isle of Wight and served as courthouse caretaker.</p>

<p><title render="italic">Materials in the Library of Virginia’s collections contain historical terms, phrases, and images that are offensive to modern readers. These include demeaning and dehumanizing references to race, ethnicity, and nationality; enslaved or free status; physical and mental ability; religion; sex; and sexual orientation and gender identity.</title></p>

<p><title render="italic">The Library of Virginia will at times choose to retain original language in collection descriptions to preserve historical accuracy or to document context.

      <p>Isle of Wight County (Va.) Commonwealth Causes Ended, 1774-1937 are criminal court cases and consist primarily of warrants, summons, indictments, and verdicts handed down by grand juries and other legal authorities in order to prosecute individuals who violated the penal code. These offenses ranged in severity from murder, rape, assault and battery, and larceny to tax evasion and slander. Criminal offenders and victims who appear in cases prior to the abolition of slavery in Virginia in 1865 included both free and enslaved persons.
</p>
      <p>Warrants were issued by grand juries, judges, and justices of the peace directing law enforcement officials to either arrest and imprison a person suspected of having committed a crime or to cause an individual to appear in court to answer accusations made against them. Peace warrants directing an offender to "keep the peace of the Commonwealth" or to restrain from any violent acts are commonly found in assault and battery cases.
</p>
      <p>Summonses were used to call a suspected person to appear in court. A summons could also be issued to direct witnesses or victims to come before the court in order to provide evidence or information deemed pertinent to a case.
</p>
      <p>An indictment is the official, written description of the crime that an accused individual is suspected of committing, which is approved by a grand jury and presented to a court in order to begin legal proceedings. Due to this process, indictments are often referred to as "presentments."
</p>
      <p>Verdicts are the formal pronouncements made by juries on issues submitted to them by a judge or other law enforcement official. In the case of a guilty verdict, a judge will sentence the offender. Sentences may include a fine, corporal punishment, and/or imprisonment.Coroners also submitted verdicts such as "death by suicide," "death by natural causes," etc. when determining the cause of a suspicious or sudden death.

          <p>These cases concern about 35 accusations against Joseph Holloway largely occurring in 1855. The charges are generally either selling ardent spirits to free Black or enslaved people, or suffering an unlawful assembly of enslaved people on his property. The cases involving selling of ardent spirits name Emmanuel, Eley, Deik, and Jim as enslaved; and Everand Joyner, Peter Lawrence, and Paul Lawrence as free Black people.  There is no verdict in any of these cases as all warrants are returned "not found in county," indicating Joseph Holloway may have fled the state.

          <p>The court charges Henry Pruden, a white man, with "feloniously cutting, mutilating and destroying the testicles" of Thad (or Thaddeus) a man Pruden enslaved. The jury finds Henry Pruden guilty and sentences him to four months in the county jail and $500 fine. Henry Pruden receives a pardon, 1858 October 28, from Governor Henry A. Wise, which required the fine to be paid by Pruden but dismissed the jail time in part due to Pruden's age and feeble health. The case proves the true inhumanity of enslavement, and the existent to which enslavers and the law viewed enslaved people as property void of personhood. See Governor Henry A. Wise Executive Papers, 1856-1859 for more information.
