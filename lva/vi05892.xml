<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p><title render="bold">Context for Record Type:  </title> During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, voting eligibility in Virginia was tied to land ownership. According to Virginia law, an eligible voter had to be an adult white man and had to own a specific amount of real property, an amount that differed for town and country residents. In 1850, the passage of a new state constitution moved away from property ownership in favor of place of residency as a qualification for enfranchisement. The secret ballot and supervisory Electoral boards were instituted following the Civil War. In 1902, another new state constitution was passed with the purpose of maintaining white suffrage while eliminating African-American voters by means of literacy tests as well as property and poll tax requirements. This constitution and its discriminatory election policies officially remained in effect until 1971.</p>
<p>Ballots indicate either the candidates running for office or is a formal record of a person's vote. Polls are lists of persons who voted in each election in each precinct. Polls are also heads of household, usually free white males, responsible for payment of taxes, or eligible to vote. </p>
<p>Because states had jurisdiction over maintaining their election returns, votes were often recorded in deed books or poll books, which listed the name of the voter as well as the candidate for whom they voted.</p>
<p>Abstracts of votes are certified by the circuit court clerk and document the summary by the Electoral Board of the official results. Includes total number of voters, write-in certification, and total votes for each candidate/issue.</p>
<p><title render="bold">Locality History:  </title> Greensville County was named either for Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene, commanding general of the Continental army in the South during part of the Revolutionary War, or for Sir Richard Grenville, leader of the Roanoke Island settlement of 1585. The county was formed from Brunswick County on 28 November 1780.</p>
