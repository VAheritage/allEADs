<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Louisa County was formed in 1742 from Hanover County. 
</p>
<p>The Virginia legislature passed an act on 27 February 1866 to legalize the marriages of former slaves who had been cohabiting as of that date. See Virginia Acts of Assembly, 1866-1867, Chapter 18, An act to amend and re-enact the 14th section of chapter 108 of the Code of Virginia for 1860, in regard to registers of marriage; and to legalize the marriages of colored persons now cohabiting as husband and wife. </p>
<p>The federal Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands directed the Assistant Superintendents of the states to order the county clerks to make a registry of such cohabiting couples. See Circular No. 11, dated 19 March 1866, in Orders, Circulars, Circular Letters, and Letters of Instruction, vol. 2 (1866). Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, Records of the Assistant Commissioner for the State of Virginia, 1865-1869. Miscellaneous reel 3880, Library of Virginia.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Louisa County (Va.) Free Negro and Slave Records, 1770-1866 consists of deeds of manumission (1783-1859); lists of free negroes (1851-1864), patrol claims (1770-1863); orders regarding patrols (1866); free negro registrations (1809-1861), a photocopy of the register of colored persons who have been cohabiting as man and wife and who are married legally by virtue of the act of the General Assembly passed February 27th, 1866 (1866); and miscellaneous records (1773-1865). 
</p>
<p>Deeds of manumission (1783, 1794-1798, 1800-1807, 1814, 1816, 1836, 1850, 1859) state the name of the slaveowner, the name of the slave to be freed, the date the slave shall achieve freedom, the date the manumission was proved or certified, and sometimes a reason why the owner decided to emancipate the slave. </p>
<p>Lists of free negroes are both lists of free negroes over the age of 12 and lists of free negroes returned who have not paid their taxes. The lists of free negroes over the age of 12 (1851-1864) give full name, age and occupation. Lists of free negroes returned who have not paid their taxes (1852-1853) lists full name, male free negroes between 21 and 55 years subject to tax of $1.00, male free negroes above 16 years of age, slaves above 16 years of age, slaves above 12 years of age, horses mules etc., why returned insolvent, and amount of tax. Both kinds of lists were compiled by the Commissioner of Revenue for tax purposes. </p>
<p>Patrol claims include the names of persons appointed to serve and the amount of pay they claimed against the city for doing the patrol work. Sometimes the number of hours worked is given instead of the amount of money owed. </p>
<p>Orders regarding patrols (1866) are both orders from Louisa county to form patrols to disarm freedmen in the county and a copy of a letter sent by the Freedmen's Bureau to Culpeper County instructing that such patrols were to be disbanded. The copy of the letter was sent to Louisa because the Freedmen's Bureau had been informed about the patrols and wrote to Louisa to instruct that the patrols there also be stopped and the seized arms returned to the freedmen. </p>
<p>Registrations of free negroes (1809, 1833, 1847-1848, 1850, 1853, 1857, 1861) contain the name of the free person, sometimes the individual's age and a brief physical description, and a statement or affidavit based either on another person's knowledge or on other official documentary evidence seen by the certifier that this person was either born free or was emancipated. If born free, reference is sometimes made to parents. If emancipated, emancipating owner, place and date of emancipation, and prior registration as a free negro are usually mentioned. Occasionally the register number is given; this number corresponds to the entry number in the register of free negroes kept by the clerk of court at the courthouse. </p>
<p>The register of colored persons who have been cohabiting as man and wife and who are married legally by virtue of the act of the General Assembly passed February 27th, 1866, is a photocopy from the original located in the records of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands (RG 105) at the National Archives. The register is commonly called a cohabitation register.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous records include bond for the hire of slave Jeffery (1773); summons for William Snelson to show cause why he sold or offered for sale the children of Sarah Martin (1776); bond to keep emancipated slave Rachel from accruing any public expense (1788); certificate of non-importation of slaves of Benjamin Litchworth (1792); petition of Abraham Kinney that he is a free man and held in slavery illegally by the representatives of Thomas Johnson (1795); bond for hire of slave Sarah and two children (1803); request of William Captain to clerk of court for a copy of his articles of freedom (1803); will of John Mead and some papers related to slave hires from his estate (1808); certificate of non-importation of slaves by Unity Turner and Thomas Turner (1813); petition of Sally, Annickey, Jordan, Solomon and Sally that they are illegally held in slavery by Joseph Perkins (1811); depositions and certifications about slave hires from Robert Thurston (1813); bond for hire of slave Salley (1817); affidavit of freedom of Wilson Kinney (1821); petition of Charles that he is entitled to his freedom by deed of John Poindexter (1824); petition of Minty alias Milley that she is illegally held in slavery by George Slaughter (1825); certification of free status of Franky and Indy, children of Franky (1833); slave pass (1833); papers related to the sale of Nancy, in jail as a runaway (1840); report of jailor on Mary Ann Collins, held in jail for want of free papers (ca. 1850s); certification of free status of Thomas Jackson and his sister Caroline Jackson (1850); certification of free status of Nancy White (1853); agreement between free negro James Nelson and Burwell B. Dickinson (1855); letter from Thomas B. Brooks regarding two elderly negroes who cannot support themselves (1855); certification of slave Fanny that she lost the free papers of her husband Thomas Dickerson (1856); order to provide Ann Jackson another copy of her free negro registration (n.d.); refusal to register Frederick Taylor of Goochland as a free negro (n.d.); letter from Orlando Brown of the Freedmen's Bureau to the Louisa County Overseers of the Poor that 12 pauper freedmen of Louisa are currently being cared for by the Bureau and instructing the county to make arrangements for their provision (1865); reply to Orlando Brown's letter that no provision can be made for the paupers and that they should not be returned to the county since they left voluntarily (ca. 1865); order that the Overseers of the Poor bind out Katy Gillespie, a freed girl (n.d.); order to place or bind out the children of two freed persons in jail for stealing (n.d.); order to the Overseers of the Poor to bind out John, Kitty and Anna Brown to David W. Isbell (n.d.). </p>
