      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Planters and Mechanics Bank was incorporated in January 1875 and conducted business in Petersburg until it dissolved in May of 1884. William Baird McIlwaine and Robert Gilliam were trustees of the bank during the late nineteenth century.
</p>
      <p>The volumes were used as exhibits in the chancery suit W.R. Nichols for others, vs. Planters and Mechanics Bank and others, and W.R. Nichols for others, versus S.P. Arrington and others, heard in the City of Petersburg Circuit Court.</p>
      <p>William Baird McIlwaine was born in Petersburg, Va., in 1854. He studied at Hampden-Sidney College and graduated in 1873. McIlwaine went on to study law and was admitted to the Bar in 1878. In addition to his work with the bank, McIlwaine was president of the Petersburg Telephone Company, a representative to the house of delegates, and a state senator for three consecutive terms.</p>
      <p>Robert Gilliam, born in 1847, was a leading attorney in Virginia. Gilliam lived in Prince George County until 1861 when he moved with his parents to Richmond. There, he became a messenger in the Confederate treasury department and rose to the level of assistant cashier by the end of the war. In 1869, Gilliam became a clerk of court in Prince George County, a position he held until 1874 when he removed to Petersburg and began practicing law. Gilliam also served as clerk of court for Petersburg from 1888 to 1915.
