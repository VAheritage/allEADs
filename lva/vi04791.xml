      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Dinwiddie County was named for Robert Dinwiddie, lieutenant governor of Virginia from 1751 to 1758. The county was formed from Prince George County in 1752.
</p>
      <p>The bulk of court records prior to 1865 were stolen, mutilated, and/or destroyed by Union troops who ransacked the courthouse during the last months of the Civil War. Post-1830 volumes such as deed books, will books, chancery order books, and marriage registers exist.

They studied the Land Tax Records, Grants, Patents that were preserved at the Library of Virginia. Their compilation includes the original land grants for Dinwiddie County, the real property owner’s name, acreage owned, how/who property was acquired, and date of ownership.</p>

These records are especially helpful when searching the land records prior to 1833. Prior to 1833 the deeds and land records were destroyed and this is the only record of land owners in the county.</p>

It later became a unit of the Research and Records Program in 1939. The HRS was responsible for creating the soundex indexes of the federal census which genealogists today have come to rely so heavily on. The HRS also compiled indexes of vital statistics, cemetery interments, school records, military records, maps, newspapers, and the list went on and on. Microfilms of these indexes were later made by other organizations.</p>

The Circuit Court kept the minute books from 1870 to 1960.  After 1960 the Code of Virginia changed and the books are now kept with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors. The books contain minutes from each board meeting during this time. In addition to the books kept in the Circuit Court Clerk's Office (1870-1960), the Clerk's Office in conjunction with the Clerk of the Board has digitally converted the board books from 1960 to 2004 and are made available on Dinwiddie County Circuit Court web site. The original books from this time are kept with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors.</p>
