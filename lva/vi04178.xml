      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Richmond was established in 1742 and in 1779 was designated the capital of Virginia effective 30 April 1780. It was incorporated as a town, although "stiled the city of Richmond," in 1782 and was incorporated as a city in 1842. It served as the capital of the Confederacy from mid-1861 to April 1865. Richmond was enlarged by the annexation of Manchester (or South Richmond) in 1910, and by the addition of Barton Heights, Fairmount, and Highland Park in 1914. The city also annexed land from Henrico County in 1867, 1892 and 1941. A further annexation from Chesterfield County occurred in 1970. Richmond was named by William Byrd (1674-1744), who envisioned the development of a city at the falls of the James River and with the help of William Mayo laid out the town in 1737. The name probably came from the English borough of Richmond upon Thames, which Byrd visited on several occasions.
</p>
      <p>The sheriff was responsible for services rendered in the prosecution of court cases (law enforcement.) The sheriff also acted as a combination of both the commissioner of revenue and the county treasurer. He was appointed by the governor from a list of three names submitted by the county court. His term of office was for one year until 1731, after which it was two years. His two deputies, also know as sub (under) sheriffs did most of the work.
</p>
      <p>The original records, from which this volume was compiled, were created by the city's Hustings, Mayor's and Circuit Courts.
</p>
<p>Established in 1742; incorporated as a town, although “stiled the city of Richmond,” in 1782. During the burning of Richmond on April 3, 1865, during the Civil War, Richmond circuit court judge John A. Meredith led efforts to save the circuit court records found at the State Court House. Rescuers successfully removed all the papers that were necessary to pending suits and many of the order books, but all of the wills and deed books were lost. Records of the superior court and circuit superior court of law and chancery were also destroyed. Most of the pre–Civil War Hustings Court records exist.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Richmond (Va.) Sheriff's Record Book, undated, 1856-1858, traces the duties of the sheriff as law enforcement official. In the first part of this volume, the sheriff records his fees for the prosecution of court cases--serving writs, subpoenas, notices and summonses in chancery to both individuals and companies around the city and various counties and other cities in the state from April to September. These pages are undated and are numbered 1-27. The rest of the volume consists of committals to and releases from the city jail from 1856-1858. Notations were made about certain individuals upon their committal to the jail and were marked through and initialed by the sheriff when the individual was released. Fees paid as a result of an individual's release from the city jail are also noted. The pages of this section are unnumbered.
