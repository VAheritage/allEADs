<p><title render="bold">Context for Record Type:</title> In 1818, Congress passed the first of three major Revolutionary War pension acts, which granted lifetime pensions to all men who had served as regular army soldiers in the Continental Line and who could demonstrate financial need. Prior to the passage of this act, pensions had been restricted to former soldiers who were no longer able to support themselves due to injuries sustained while in service. An applicant for pension under the 1818 act had to make a declaration under oath that he had spent at least nine months in Continental service and provide justification as to why he "by reason of his reduced circumstances in life, shall be, in need of assistance from his country for his support." 
</p>
<p>The second act, passed by Congress in 1820, required applicants to provide more concrete evidence of this in the form of a certified inventory of his property and income. They also had to include an account of all members of the applicant's family. This included a description of each individual's health and ability to contribute to household income. The Secretary of War could review these reports and would remove any applicants or pensioners under the 1818 act for whom assistance was deemed unnecessary. Applicants who disagreed with this decision could file secondary appeals.</p>
<p>On June 7, 1832, Congress enacted pension legislation extending benefits more universally than under any previous legislation. This act provided for full pay for life for all officers and enlisted men who served at least two years in the Continental Line, the state troops or militia, or the navy or marines. Men who served between six months and two years were granted pensions of less than full pay. Benefits were payable effective March 4, 1831, without regard to financial need or disability. Widows or children of Revolutionary War veterans were entitled to collect any unpaid benefits due from the last payment to a veteran until his death.</p>
<p>Congress passed a related act in 1836 granting pensions to the widows and orphans of Revolutionary War veterans. Widows had to make their own declarations under oath, verifying their late husbands' service and providing evidence that their marriage had taken place prior to his leaving service.</p>
<p><title render="bold">Locality History:  </title> The city of Richmond, located between Henrico and Chesterfield Counties, was named by William Byrd (1674-1744), who envisioned the development of a city at the falls of the James River and with the help of William Mayo laid out the town in 1737. The name probably came from the English borough of Richmond upon Thames, which Byrd visited on several occasions. Richmond was established in 1742 and in 1779 was designated the capital of Virginia effective 30 April 1780. It was incorporated as a town, although "stiled the city of Richmond," in 1782 and was incorporated as a city in 1842. It served as the capital of the Confederacy from mid-1861 to April 1865. Richmond was enlarged by the annexation of Manchester (or South Richmond) in 1910, and by the addition of Barton Heights, Fairmount, and Highland Park in 1914. Further annexations from Chesterfield County occurred in 1942 and 1970.</p>
<p><title render="bold">Lost Locality Note: </title> Richmond is one of Virginia's Lost Records Localities. During the burning of Richmond on April 3, 1865, during the Civil War, Richmond circuit court judge John A. Meredith led efforts to save the circuit court records found at the State Court House. Rescuers successfully removed all the papers that were necessary to pending suits and many of the order books, but all of the wills and deed books were lost. Records of the superior court and circuit superior court of law and chancery were also destroyed. Most of the pre-Civil War Hustings Court records exist.</p>
