<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The Brooke family was prominent in Essex County, Virginia, during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Several branches of the family lived in the county, and one became known as the Taliaferro Brooke family because of intermarriage with the Taliaferros. One of those marriages was between William Brooke (d. 1734) and Sarah Taliaferro Brooke (d. 1763). The Brookes owned a great amount of property in Essex County and several of its members held offices in the county government.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Papers, 1650-1835, of the Brooke family of Essex County, Virginia, consisting of agreements, bonds, deeds, decrees, depositions, land grants, powers of attorney, plats, receipts, reports, surveys, wills, and writs of commission. Most of these papers are deeds, grants and surveys, the rest deal with land title transfers in some manner. Eight of the records predate the existence of Essex County, and are from York and Rappahannock Counties, Virginia, when Essex was part of them in the 17th century.
