<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>On March 17, 1856 the General Assembly passed an act for preventing the escape of enslaved people entitled "An Act providing additional protection for the slave property of citizens of this commonwealth.” This act authorized the inspection of ships departing from Virginia, rewards of up to $500 to any white person who provided information leading to the conviction of any other white person who attempted to help an enslaved person escape, or the apprehension and arrest of escaped enslaved people. The reward was paid by either the slave holder and/or state upon the order of the court convicting the party of such offense, provided the conviction was due to the testimony of someone other than the informer.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection consists of records from 1857 to 1860, including the following: warrants for payment submitted to the Auditor of Public Accounts, responses to said warrants, and signed testimonies and affidavits affirming their right to payment.
</p>
<p>
The testimonies and affidavits list the individual entitled to a reward, and the reason for it. Typically, these men sought payment for either apprehending enslaved people who had "absconded," or for providing information on individuals who assisted or aided enslaved people in their escape. A significant portion of these cases took place in the northern part of Virginia as the enslaved people escaped to either Pennsylvania or Ohio before being apprehended. The records list the enslaved people, who owned them, and occasionally an assigned value in order to calculate the payment owed by the state.</p>
<p>Payment requests ranged from $50 to $1500, but not all of them were honored. Some records include responses from the Auditor of Public Accounts noting that there was no money in the fund to disperse.</p>
