      <head>Historical Information</head>
      <p>The Society of the Cincinnati was formed on 10-13 May 1783
         by American Revolutionary Army officers who met at Mount
         Gulian, the American Army's cantonment on the east bank of the
         Hudson River. After resigning his post as General, George
         Washington (1732-1799) accepted an invitation to become the
         society's first president. Major General Henry Knox
         (1750-1806) was the secretary and for years the guiding spirit
         of the organization. Membership extended to those officers of
         the Continental Army and Navy who had served to the end of the
         war or had resigned with honor after three years of service
         and to those who had been rendered supernumerary because of
         regimental reorganization by Congress. In addition, the
         institution provided that officers who had died in service
         could be represented in the Society by their eldest male
         descendants. The society was named in honor of Lucius Quintus
         Cincinnatus, who after a distinguished military career in the
         service of the Roman republic, had returned to civilian life.
         The Society of the Cincinnati was the first patriotic society
         organized in the United States. Today the Society is a
         not-for-profit organization supporting educational, cultural,
         and literary activities that promote the ideals of liberty and
         constitutional government.</p>
      <p>Within a year constituent societies were established in the
         thirteen states and in France by officers and members of the
         general society. Officers established the Society of the
         Cincinnati in the State of Virginia on 6 October 1783 in
         Fredericksburg, Virginia. Members selected Brigadier General
         George Weedon of Westmoreland County as their president pro
         tem at the first meeting; he later served several more terms
         as society president. They also chose Horatio Gates as the
         permanent society president at the initial meeting. Members
         adopted the general society's articles of institution or
         charter and pledged to send five members to the national
         convention the following May. Notable members at the first
         meeting were Edward Carrington, William Heth, James Wood, and
         Henry Lee. The hereditary principle embraced by other state
         societies was abandoned by the Virginia society. Accordingly
         the Virginia society dissolved in 1824 after most of the
         original members had died. Pension funds were transferred to
         the state treasury and disbursed by the state treasurer. The
         Society of the Cincinnati in the State of Virginia was
         reformed in the 1890's by descendants of the original
         members.</p>
