      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Papers, 1881-1938, of Mary-Cooke Branch Munford of
         Richmond, Virginia, documenting her work in various political,
         educational, social, economic, and inter-racial endeavors. The
         bulk of the collection covers the period from 1910-1930, when
         she was most active.</p>
      <p>The CO-ORDINATE COLLEGE LEAGUE series includes
         correspondence and subject files concerning Munford's and the
         League's attempts to convince The University of Virginia to
         admit women by establishing a coordinate college with its own
         organization, and its own social, residence and instruction
         halls. The new college would share the library and
         laboratories of the University, and students would be taught
         by some of its faculty. The papers include correspondence from
         educators at the University of Virginia, as well as around the
         state and nation, business leaders, politicians, and members
         of the League. The subject files contain accounts, legislative
         information, including research data, drafts of bills
         introduced on behalf of the League, and voting records of the
         members of the General Assembly, resolutions, brochures,
         flyers, and pamphlets, mailing and membership lists, and
         information from various educational, labor, alumni, and other
         groups opposing and supporting the League's efforts. There is
         also a large amount of clippings from Richmond newspapers, as
         well as other Virginia newspapers, which document the League's
         activities.</p>
      <p>The EDUCATION series includes information on Munford's
         activities in the field of education. It includes information
         from The University of Virginia, including dockets and minutes
         of the Board of Visitors, the Richmond Education Association,
         the Richmond Lancastrian School, Southern Industrial Classes,
         and the Richmond public schools. Also included is information
         on the status, salaries, and working conditions of teachers.
         This series also contains a variety of published newsletters,
         bulletins, annual reports, and other educational
         publications.</p>
      <p>The FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL POLITICS series contains
         subject files documenting Munford's assistance during World
         War I, and her interest in world peace. It includes a large
         amount of material on here work on the Women's Committee of
         the Council of National Defense during the war, and her help
         in food conservation and registration drives. There is also
         information on her activities in the Foreign Policy
         Association and the Walter Hines Page School of International
         Relations, as well as peace groups, including the Conference
         on the Cause and Cure of War. This series also contains
         material on Munford's involvement in the Democratic Party and
         the League of Women Voters.</p>
      <p>The RACE RELATIONS series includes subject files on
         Munford's activities with the Commission on Inter-racial
         Cooperation, Richmond Urban League, National Urban League,
         Woman's Inter-Racial Committee, National League on Urban
         Conditions Among Negroes, Committee on Colored Work, and the
         Commission on Inter-racial Cooperation. There is also
         correspondence, clippings, and financial information, as well
         as publications concerning race relations.</p>
      <p>The VIRGINIA'S ATTITUDE TOWARD SLAVERY AND SECESSION series
         concerns this book, written by her husband, Beverley Bland
         Munford, in 1909. Much of the material concerns Mrs. Munford's
         work in getting the book re- adopted by the State Board of
         Education as required text in history courses taught in high
         schools in Virginia after her husband's death in 1910. The
         series contains correspondence, briefs and comments, circular
         letters, and postcards, as well as material on the book's
         publication, orders, and sales.</p>
      <p>The MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECT FILES series contains accounts,
         bank statements, correspondence, a notebook belonging to
         Beverley Bland Munford, dated 1881-1885, and information on
         other groups and activities in which Mrs. Munford was
         involved. There are also blueprints of alterations to her
         cottage in Maine by William Lawrence Bottomley, dated 1923,
         filed in the General Architectural Files, Folder 126. Also
