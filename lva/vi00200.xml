<p>Hebron Lutheran Church is the oldest Lutheran congregation in Virginia and the South, and worships in the oldest Lutheran church building in continuous use. While the first Lutherans who came to Virginia in
1717 settled near a German colony of Reformed members, and shared a close association with them, Hebron was never a union church. Organized in 1717 and built in 1740, the church has been in the following counties:
Essex, 1717; Spotsylvania, 1721 (moved 1725); Orange, 1734; Culpeper, 1749; and Madison, 1793. For more information, see <title render="italic">History of the Hebron Lutheran Church, Madison County, Virginia, from
1717 to 1907</title>, by William Peter Huddle, 1908, and <title render="italic">Hebron Lutheran Church: A Brief History, 1717-1974</title>, by Jeannie Edna Light, 1974.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Records, 1871-1882 and n.d., including an 1871 account by pastor Henry Wetzel (1816-1890) of the 1868 creation of the Evangelical Lutheran Concordia Synod of Virginia. Wetzel's history was intended to refute
criticisms made by the Tennessee Synod, from which Concordia had extricated itself. In addition to this manuscript, the collection also contains lengthy notes on the origins and history, through 1882, of Hebron
Church, now located in Madison County, Virginia. Among the notes is a handwritten copy of a 1737 pamphlet written by Johann Caspar Stover (d. ca. 1738), the congregation's first official pastor, to solicit funds
from Evangelicals in his native Germany.
