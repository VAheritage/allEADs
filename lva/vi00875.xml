<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>John Tyler, Sr., was born on 28 February 1747 in James City County to John Tyler and Ann Contesse. Tyler attended William and Mary College and later studied law under Robert Carter Nicholas. Tyler began
practicing law in Charles City County in 1770. An ardent supporter of the Revolution, Tyler served as a member of the Committee of Safety for Charles City County in 1774 and raised a company of troops when Lord
Dunmore removed the powder from the magazine at Williamsburg. In 1776, he was appointed to a one-year term as judge of the Court of Admiralty. Tyler was elected to represent Charles City County in the House of
Delegates where he served from 1778 until 1786. While a member of the House of Delegates, Tyler succeeded Benjamin Harrison as Speaker of the House of Delegates in 1781, serving in that capacity until 1785. In
addition, Tyler, along with James Madison, proposed a meeting of states in Annapolis in 1786 to discuss granting Congress to power to regulate commerce. The Annapolis Convention led to the Constitutional
Convention of 1787 to revise the Articles of Confederation. In 1786, Tyler replaced Benjamin Waller as judge of the Court of Admiralty. As vice-president of the Virginia Convention of 1788, Tyler, a states-rights
advocate, voted against the ratification of the Federal Constitution. Tyler was elected to the General Court in 1788 when the new Constitution assigned jurisdiction of the Court of Admiralty to the federal courts.
Tyler served as judge of the General Court until 12 December 1808 when he was elected to succeed William H. Cabell as governor. Tyler was elected to two additional one-year terms, but resigned the governorship on
15 January 1811 in order to accept an appointment as judge of the Federal District Court for Virginia.
</p>
<p>John Tyler married Mary Armistead, daughter of Robert Booth Armistead, in 1776. Their son, John Tyler, Jr., served as both governor of Virginia from 1825 to 1827 and as the 10th President of the United States
from 1841 to 1845. Tyler died at "Greenway", his residence in Charles City County, on 6 January 1813.
