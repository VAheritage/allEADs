         <p>Walter Jones (1776-1861) of Virginia was the son of Dr.
         Walter Jones and Ailsie Flood. After studying law under
         Bushrod Washington, Walter Jones was admitted to the bar in
         1796. In 1802 President Thomas Jefferson appointed him the
         United States attorney for the District of Columbia, an office
         which he held until 1821. He also was a major general in the
         District of Columbia militia, and during the War of 1812 he
         took part in the Battle of Bladensburg. Jones gained a
         national reputation for the prominent part he took in the
         celebrated Girard will case, the Myra Clark Gaines case,
         McCullough vs. Maryland, the Randolph will case, Chesapeake
         and Ohio Canal Company vs. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
         Company, and John Randall vs. Chesapeake and Delaware Canal
         Company. He was married in 1808 to Anne Lucinda and with her
         had three sons and eleven daughters. Upon his death in
         Washington, D.C., he was buried in the Congressional
         Cemetery.</p>
         <p>William Hayward Foote (1781-1846) inherited "Hayfield" from
         his aunt and adopted mother Elizabeth Foote. Hayfield
         plantation was a 360 acre portion of the Mount Vernon estate
         acquired by Elizabeth Foote's husband, Lund Washington, from
         George Washington after the Revolutionary War. William Foote
         prospered as Hayfield's proprietor and in his will bequeathed
         the estate and all his property to his wife of 15 years, Mary
         Marshall Scott Foote. After his death the executors of the
         will led by Francis L. Smith contested William Foote's heirs'
         entitlement. In his will he had bequeathed everything to his
         wife "for as long as she remains my widow or for life... if,
         however, she should cease to be my widow or marry again, she
         must account for all these things and take her dower at law...
         It is not my purpose to give any Cur a Sop."</p>

         <p>Papers, 1846-1850, including correspondence concerning the
         will of William Hayward Foote (1781-1846) of Hayfield, Fairfax
         County, Virginia and the law suit filed following his death
         between his heirs and his executors. Includes letter (3
         leaves), 26 April, from Walter Jones (1776-1861), Esquire, to
         William H. Foote asking for a detailed account of his real
         estate and personal property to be included in Jones' draft of
         Foote's will. Letter (7 leaves), Dec. 1846, from Walter Jones
         to Francis L. Smith (1808-1877), Esquire, in Alexandria,
         Virginia answering four questions asked by Smith concerning
         the powers of Foote's heirs and executors to sell his personal
         property and real estate. Another undated letter (2 leaves)
         from Smith to Jones contains the questions that Jones answers
         in the December 1846 letter. Legal answer (7 leaves), 10 March
         1847, written by Walter Jones outlining his opinions on
         questions concerning the interpretation of Foote's will,
         specifically the personal property and real estate
         entitlements of Foote's widow, the emancipation of his slaves,
         and the sale of his crops. Also contains payment receipts (3
         leaves): one receipt, 27 May 1850, payable to Dr. James Hunter
         for his services resurveying Hayfield plantation for the suit
         of Foote's heirs versus Foote's executors; one receipt, 5 Dec.
         1850, payable to Francis L. Smith for the balance standing for
         the sale of Hayfield; and one receipt, 11 May 1848, signed by
         Walter Jones and claiming from Francis L. Smith an amount of
         fifty dollars payed for a draft of an answer to the bill of
