<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Warwick County was originally called Warwick River County when it was formed as one of the original eight shires in 1634.  The shorter name was adopted in 1643.  It was named either for Robert Rich, earl of Warwick, a prominent member of the London Company, or for the county of Warwick in England.  Warwick County became extinct in 1952, when it became the city of Warwick.  The new city was consolidated with the city of Newport News in 1958 and took the latter's name.  Denbigh was the county seat.
</p>
<p>Newport News was located in Warwick County, which is now extinct.  The origin of the name is uncertain but the phrase "Newportes News" appeared in documents as early as 1619 and probably commemorated Christopher Newport, who made five voyages to Virginia between 1607 and 1619.  Newport News was a small settlement until late in the nineteenth century, when it became the eastern terminus of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway.  It was established in 1880 and incorporated as a city by act of the General Assembly in 1896 without ever having been incorporated as a town.  Newport News was enlarged by consolidation with the city of Warwick in 1858.</p>
