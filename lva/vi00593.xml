<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Josiah Parker was born 11 May 1751 at the Parker family estate "Macclesfield" in Isle of Wight County, Virginia. He was a member of the Committee of Safety and of the second through fourth Virginia Conventions in 1775. Commissioned a major in the 5th Virginia regiment 13 February 1776, Parker served under General Charles Lee (1731-1782) until the Fall of 1776, when he was transferred to George Washington's army. Parker was promoted to lieutenant colonel 18 July 1777 and to colonel 1 April 1778, but resigned from the army 12 July 1778. He represented Isle of Wight in the Virginia House of Delegates 1778-1779. During the latter stages of the American Revolution, Governor Thomas Jefferson appointed Parker to command all Virginia militia south of the James River and to work in cooperation with the Marquis de Lafayette (1757-1834), who commanded the Continental army troops there. Parker returned to the House of Delegates in 1782-1783, and was appointed naval officer for the ports of Norfolk and Portsmouth, serving in that post from 1786 to 1788. An unsuccessful candidate to the convention to ratify the Federal constitution, Parker won election to the United States House of Representatives, and served from 1789 to 1801. After leaving Congress, Parker engaged in various agricultural pursuits. He married Mary Pierce Bridger, a widow, 26 May 1773. Parker died 14 or 18 March 1810, in Isle of Wight County, and was buried at "Macclesfield."
