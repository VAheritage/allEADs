         <head>Historical Information</head>
         <p>Following the passage of the National Defense Act in 1916,
         the Virginia State militia changed its name from the Virginia
         Volunteers to the Virginia National Guard. On March 9, 1916,
         Pancho Villa and a band of Mexican bandits raided the town of
         Columbus, New Mexico killing seventeen Americans. President
         Woodrow Wilson ordered Maj. Gen. John J. Pershing and a
         15,000-man force on a "Punitive Expedition" into Mexico. The
         War Department telegraphed the governor of Virginia to
         mobilize the Virginia National Guard to protect the Mexican
         Border while the Regular Army units carried out the
         expedition. The 1st, 2nd, and 4th Infantry Regiments, in
         addition to the 1st Squadron of Cavalry and the 1st Field
         Artillery Battalion of the Virginia National Guard, were
         sent.</p>
         <p>Shortly thereafter, the United States declared war on
         Germany on April 6, 1917, and all of Virginia's National Guard
         were drafted into Federal service. The 1st, 2nd, and 4th
         Infantry Regiments were combined to form the 116th Infantry
         Regiment of the United States, part of the 29th Infantry
         Division. The 116th joined guardsmen from New Jersey,
         Maryland, and the District of Columbia at Camp McClellan in
         Anniston, Alabama, for training before departing for France in
         1918. After the war, it was decided that all the Virginia
         National Guard units which were discharged from federal
         service would be returned to civilian status. As a result,
         Virginia found it necessary to replenish its National Guard
         units. Two regiments of infantry, a machine gun company, and a
         battery of artillery were formed and its companies designated
         as provisional or separate and numbered instead of lettered so
         as not to interfere with those units in existence before the
         war. The "provisional" designation was dropped in September
         1920 and the companies were again lettered.</p>
         <p>Following the war, the Virginia National Guard consisted of
         the following units: 91st Infantry Brigade; 116th Infantry;
         183rd Infantry; 111th Field Artillery; Ambulance Battalion
         Headquarters, 104th Medical Regiment; Ambulance Co. No. 110;
         Hospital Co. No. 110; Medical Support Section No. 104; Medical
         Laboratory Section No. 104; 29th Signal Company; 29th Tank
         Company; 167th Engineer Battalion; Co. B, 111th Military
         Police Battalion; and 16th Service Battalion. Between 1918 and
         1922, numerous changes took place in the Virginia National
         Guard. The 1st and 2nd Infantry were re-designated by the War
         Department as the 183rd and 116th Infantry, respectively. The
         1st Brigade became the 91st Brigade. The 1st Coast Defense
         Command of the Coast Artillery Corps was re-designated as the
         246th Artillery and the units of that regiment including the
         411th through 415th Companies Coast Artillery Corps were
         re-designated Batteries A through H of the 246th
         Artillery.</p>
