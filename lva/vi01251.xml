      <head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
      <p>The Pleasants family were a prominent Virginia Quaker family with lands on the Upper James River. John Pleasants (d. 1698) emigrated from England and settled in Henrico County, Virginia, around 1665. He
converted to Quakerism and was an active and prominent member of the church, donating land to the church, the Curles Meeting House, and filing peitions and reports to the authorities on behalf of the Society of
Friends. He married Jane (Larcome) Tucker, widow of Samuel Tucker, in 1670.
</p>
      <p>John Pleasants, II (1671-1714), was the son of John and Jane Pleasants. He married Dorothy Cary, daughter of Thomas and Ann (Milner) Cary, in 1694.
</p>
      <p>His second son, John Pleasants III (1697-1771), also a Quaker, amassed a fortune in land and slaves, but in later life he advocated the abolition of slavery. In his last will, 11 August 1771, he requested that
his slaves be emancipated. He married three times, first to Margaret Jordan (b. 1699), daughter of Robert Jordan and his first wife Mary (Belson) Jordan. In 1750 he married Mary Woodson, daughter of Tarleton and
Judith (Fleming) Woodson. Finally he married Miriam Hunnicutt, widow of Glaister Hunnicutt.
</p>
      <p>Robert Pleasants (1723-1810), second son of John and Margaret Pleasants, was born at "Curles" Plantation, Henrico County, Virginia. He was a staunch Quaker, zealous agitator against slavery, and the first
president of the Abolition Society of Virginia, established in 1790. In 1782 he successfully lobbied for the Manumission Act and in 1792 sent a petition to the U.S. Congress from the Virginia Abolition Society
calling for the end to the slave trade. He went to court repeatedly to free hundreds of slaves. In 1784 Robert founded the Gravelly Hill School, the first school for free blacks in Virginia, and set aside 350
acres of land to maintain the schools.
</p>
      <p>Samuel Pleasants (1737-1807), also a son of John and Margaret Pleasants, was born at "Curles" Plantation. At the age of twenty five, he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and established himself as a
merchant. He married Mary Pemberton (1738-1821) in 1762. He was also active in the abolitionist movement. In 1777, Samuel Pleasants, along with several of his brothers-in-law and other prominent Quakers, were
arrested and imprisoned as "Torries" because they refused to bear arms. General George Washington intervened and personally signed an order for their release.
</p>
      <p>James Pleasants (1769-1836), served as Governor of Virginia, 1822-1825. His son, John Hampden Pleasants (1797-1846), founded the Richmond Whig newspaper. He married Ann Elizabeth Irvin and Mary Massie. He was
killed on 27 February 1846 in a duel with Thomas Ritchie, Jr., owner of rival newspaper the Richmond Enquirer.
