      <head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>A chancery cause is a case of equity where justice is administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law. A judge or justices, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case. The judge often would appoint commissioners to evaluate the situation in the field and offer their opinion to the court. </p>
      <p>Bristol, on the Virginia-Tennessee border in Washington County, originally was called Goodson, for Samuel Goodson who founded the town in 1850. Goodson was incorporated as a town in 1856, four years after the town of Bristol, Tennessee, was laid out in Sullivan County, Tennessee, contiguous to Goodson. In 1890, Goodson was incorporated as a city, and its name was changed to Bristol for its Tennessee neighbor. Today the two cities have separate governments but share a public library. When the Virginia-Tennessee boundary was settled in 1901, Bristol, Virginia, received from Bristol, Tennessee, the northern half of the main street between the two cities.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Bristol (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1890-1912, are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff complaint), answers (defendant response), decrees (court decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p> 
<p>Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.</p>
