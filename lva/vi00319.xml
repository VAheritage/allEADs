         <p>Ross, Shore &amp; Company was just one of the many business
         ventures undertaken by David Ross (1739-1819) of Albemarle,
         Botetourt, Buckingham, Campbell, Cumberland, Fluvanna,
         Goochland, Mecklenburg Counties, and Richmond, Virginia.
         Perhaps his business acumen and presence convinced the other
         partners to assign Ross the role of director of Ross, Shore
         &amp; Company.</p>
         <p>Ross was one of the richest of all merchants and planters
         in Virginia in the 1780's. Born in Scotland about 1739, he had
         immigrated to the United States in the mid-1750's. By the time
         of the American Revolution, Ross had established himself as a
         leading tobacco merchant and shipowner in Richmond and
         Petersburg. He also owned and managed a large plantation at
         Point of Fork at the junction of the James and Rivanna Rivers.
         By the late 1780's, when his wealth had reached its peak, he
         had amassed over 100,000 acres of land scattered across twelve
         Virginia counties. Ross also owned more horses than anyone in
         the state; owned the second most amount of cattle; and claimed
         ownership of 400 slaves, the fifth highest amount in the
         state.</p>
         <p>Early in the Revolutionary War, Ross had to defend himself
         against loyalist charges; though, he successfully subverted
         all attempts to slander his name, in part by supporting
         patriot troops financially. In late 1780 Ross began a tenure
         as commercial agent for Virginia, a position whose
         responsibility was the supply of state troops with clothing,
         weapons, and ammunition. As commercial agent, Ross drew
         heavily upon his own wealth to suffice the troops' demands,
         resigning his post in April 1782. (Ross resigned in order to
         take a position in the Virginia General Assembly.) Despite his
         monetary input during the Revolution, Ross found after the war
         that he was quite stable financially. He expanded his
         investments and further developed an important industrial
         property he had acquired during the war years, the Oxford Iron
         Works. This pig- iron juggernaut was located south of the
         James River eight miles from Lynchburg. Ross had acquired the
         Works around 1776 and began almost immediately to exploit the
         wartime demand for iron. By the early 1780's, Thomas Jefferson
         estimated that the Works produced more pig iron than any other
         industrial furnace in Virginia. Yet for several reasons Ross,
         the Works, and his estate fell on hard times in the early
         1800's. The provisions of his will and the necessity of
         settling his debts were the prime factors behind the sale of
         the Oxford slave force following Ross' death in 1819.</p>
         <p>Thomas Shore (d. 1803), already a Petersburg merchant
         shipper, was appointed by the partners of Ross, Shore &amp;
         Company to management of the company's business at Petersburg
         and ordered to establish a trading house there. Prior to Ross,
         Shore &amp; Company, Shore had attended Donald Robertson's
         School in King and Queen County from 1767-1769, and in 1776 he
         was appointed purchasing agent for the James River district by
         the commissioners of the Navy Board in Williamsburg. Shortly
         after the Revolution, he built a home "Violet Bank" on a hill
         overlooking the Appomattox River in Colonial Heights,
         Chesterfield County. Shore also was an avid rider and owned
         membership in the Petersburg Jockey Club. On 25 June 1793 he
         married Jane Gray Wall in Greensville County; they
         subsequently had three daughters.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>Articles of incorporation, 22 Dec. 1778, for Ross, Shore
         &amp; Company, a mercantile partnership based in Richmond,
         Virginia. The principal partners were David Ross (1739-1819),
         Thomas Shore (d. 1803), Thomas Pleasants, Christopher
         McConnico, Mark Freeman, and John Hay. Within the articles of
         incorporation, the partners assign the purpose of the business
         and its intended duration. They also set the rights and
         liabilities of the partners as shareholders and define the
         duties of the partners as employees of the business. Attached
         to the articles of incorporation are the strategic plans of
         the business put forth by the partners at a meeting, 26 July
         1779. For related material see Acc. 37815.</p>
