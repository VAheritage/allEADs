         <head>Historical Information</head>
         <p>The General Assembly passed an act on March 29, 1871 to
         provide for the organization of the Volunteer Militia of the
         State, and to repeal existing laws concerning the same. The
         militia, known as the Virginia Volunteers, was to consist of
         volunteers to be called into service in case of war, invasion,
         riots, etc. On March 17, 1884, another act was passed by the
         General Assembly to provide for the organization, maintenance
         and government of the Virginia volunteers. This act stipulated
         that the Virginia Volunteers should consist of no more than
         sixty companies of infantry, eight batteries of artillery, and
         ten troops of cavalry. The act also created the position of
         assistant inspector general whose duty was to muster and
         inspect each company, troop, or battery of volunteers once
         each year. The assistant inspector general then reported the
         result of these inspections to the adjutant general.</p>
         <p>On April 25, 1898, the United States declared war on Spain.
         Immediately, the Secretary of War telegraphed J. Hodge Tyler,
         the Governor of Virginia, stating that three regiments of
         twelve companies of infantry were required for the war effort.
         The three regiments consisted of four companies from the 1st
         Regiment Infantry, eight companies from the 2nd Regiment
         Infantry, nine companies from the 3rd Regiment Infantry, eight
         companies from the 4th Regiment Infantry, two companies of the
         3rd Battalion Infantry, and two companies of the 4th Battalion
         Infantry. With the addition of three new companies organized
         in Fairfax, Wytheville, and Lynchburg, these thirty-six
         companies comprised the three regiments which were designated
         the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Virginia Infantry. Later, another
         regiment, designated the 6th Virginia Infantry, was created to
         fulfill the President's additional call for volunteers. The
         1st and 2nd Battalions Infantry, consisting of colored
         soldiers, were mustered into this regiment. In addition, three
         divisions of naval volunteers were added in 1898 to the
         preexisting division established by an act of the General
         Assembly in 1894.</p>
         <p>On April 29, 1899, the Adjutant General issued General
         Order No. 2 which disbanded and declared out of existence the
         1st Brigade, the 1st through 4th Regiments Infantry, and the
         1st through 4th Battalions Infantry. Only one company of
         infantry at Smithfield, one troop of cavalry at Surry, and the
         1st Battalion Artillery remained in service as Virginia
         Volunteers. General Order No. 4, however, re-established 14
         companies of infantry (unassigned to a regiment) in the
         Virginia Volunteers. In addition, three divisions of naval
         volunteers were added in 1898 to the preexisting division
         established by an act of the General Assembly in 1894 (this
         battalian disbanded in 1901). Following the war, the
         reorganization of the Virginia Volunteers continued with the
         assignment of new numbers to the regiments in order to
         distinguish those regiments who fought in the Civil and
         Spanish-American Wars. The 70th and 71st Infantry were the
         first of the new regiments organized in 1900 followed by the
         72nd Infantry in 1905. A law was passed by the General
         Assembly on January 16, 1908, amending Section 306 of the Code
         of Virginia. This law stipulated that the organization,
         armament, and discipline of the Virginia militia or volunteers
         shall be the same as that of the regular and volunteer armies
         of the United States. In addition, the infantry regiments were
         again reorganized to reflect a tighter geographical grouping
         and were reassigned their pre-1898 designations (i.e. 1st,
         2nd, &amp; 4th Regiments). At this time, the first company of
         the Virginia Coast Artillery was formed to reinforce the
         regular army units in Hampton Roads. Three additional
         companies of Coast Artillery were organized by 1910, but the
         entire Coast Artillery Corps was disbanded in 1911 and not
         reorganized until 1916.</p>
         <p>Following the draft into federal service and mobilization
         of the Virginia National Guard for Mexican Border Service and
         later war against Germany in 1917, a need arose to create a
         new militia force in Virginia. By order of Governor Henry C.
         Stuart, Adjutant General W.W. Sale issued a form letter
         authorizing the immediate formation of Home Defense
         organizations to be known as "Virginia State Volunteers" to
         serve during "the emergency." Two classes of Home Defense
         Organizations were created consisting of the Virginia State
         Volunteers and Virginia Home Guard. Lt. Col. Jo Lane Stern,
         State Inspector, was assigned the duty of organizing these
         volunteers. Companies of Virginia Volunteers were raised
         throughout the state including two battalions of infantry and
         over twenty individual companies. After the signing of the
         Armistice, most of these units disbanded or mustered out by
         1920, although three companies passed over into the National
         Guard.</p>
