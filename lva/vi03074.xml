<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>King William County was formed from King and Queen County by an act passed in 1701 to take effect 11 April 1702.  The county was named for King William III.
</p>
<p>Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
<p>According to the Service Records of Virginia Soldiers in the American Army During the Revolutionary War, Reel 78, William McGeorge was a private in the 5th and 7th Virginia Regiments during the war. He enlisted in King William County on February 14, 1778 and was discharged on February 16, 1779. Regimental records indicate that he was sick for most of his enlistment. However, he managed to fight in the Battle of Monmouth, June 28, 1778 in New Jersey--the last major battle in the northern theater and the largest one-day battle of the war. There is no existing information on where he was born or who his parents were.
</p>
<p>According to additional records found at the Library of Virginia, he was awarded a federal pension on October 26, 1819 (S38201) and was 63 years old. He was removed from the pension rolls in 1820 when he failed to provide a schedule of his estate and income as demanded by an Act of Congress. In 1844, his wife was attempting to collect his pension. According to a sworn deposition filed by late ensign, Thomas Lipscomb on March 5, 1814 in King William County, William McGeorge served three years during the Revolutionary War and was therefore entitled to Bounty Land. On April 4, 1814, he was issued a certificate by the Land Office. He immediately turned the property over to an assignee, David L Smith.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>King William County (Va.) Will of William McGeorge is dated November 25, 1822. The will is included as part of a chancery cause filed in the county in which Elizabeth McGeorge, widow of William McGeorge and his heirs are suing his executor also named William McGeorge. The cause may have ended in 1825. According to the information contained with the copy of the will, the suit involved the valuation, division and allotment of eleven slaves (all named) within the family. According to his will, his wife received three slaves--Caroline, Cyrus and Frankey. One slave, Rachel, was held in trust for his granddaughter, Mary Ann McGeorge.
