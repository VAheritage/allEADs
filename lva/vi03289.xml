      <head>Historical Information
</head>
	<p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories. </p>
	<p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Fluvanna County takes its name from an eighteenth-century designation of the upper James River. The name, meaning river of Anne, was originally bestowed in honor of Queen Anne of England. The county was formed from Albemarle County in 1777. The county seat is Palmyra.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Fluvanna County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1779-1912, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.</p>
      <p>Chancery causes that ended before 1865, as well as some that ended afterwards, may contain information related to free and enslaved Black and multiracial individuals. However, these cases largely represent the perspective of white enslavers and their disputes involving the sale, hiring, financial responsibilities, and legality of ownership of Black individuals. Under the system of chattel slavery, laws permitted enslavers to treat enslaved people as personal possessions in the same manner as livestock, farm equipment, or household items.</p>
      <p>Commonly found surnames among the plaintiffs and defendants include Anderson, Appleberry (also spelled Applebury), Flanagan (also spelled Flannagan and Flanergan), Haden, Hughes, Johnson, Kent, Magruder, Martin, Pace, Parrish, Payne, Perkins, Richardson, Shepherd, Stone, Strange, Thomas, Wills, and Woodson.</p>

          <p>While not the central dispute of the suit, Walter Keyâs will stipulates that Linah, an enslaved woman, "who has a husband in the [neighborhood] should be sold by my executors privately. . . to some humane master, convenient to her husband." Additionally, Key requests that Caesar, Peter, and Rosanna, also married to enslaved individuals in the neighborhood, be similarly sold.
