<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
<p>Scott County was named for Winfield Scott, a native of Virginia, in recognition of his victories during the War of 1812.  It was formed from Lee, Russell, and Washington counties in 1814.
</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Scott County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1816-1912, are indexed into <extref entityref="chancery">the Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, business records, or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
<p>Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.

<p>The bill and affidavit describe the birth of a bastard mulatto child named Molly to a convict servant woman named Rose Fitzgerald, in Albemarle County in 1762 and 1763.  The child, Molly, was bound by the parish to Joseph Kincaid until she reached the age of 31.  Robert Logan bought the time of the Molly, and when Robert Logan died his son James Logan inherited the time. James Logan let her go free when she turned 31.  He sold the time of two sons, Marcus and Andrew, Molly had while she was bound to Logan to Moses Cawood of Washington County.  In Washington County, Molly sued Logan for false imprisonment and damages, alleging she had never been bound legally to Joseph Kincaid, and she sued others for the freedom of three sons, Marcus, Andrew, and Joe.  The jury awarded her damages and loss of time she had been legally confined, and on behalf of her sons.  Logan appealed to the District Court but the court record from Washington County couldn't be found.  The District Court reversed the decision concerning the sons, but not Molly, costing Logan 700 dollars.  Since that time, Logan found a witness, Andrew Greer, of Carter County, TN, who married a daughter of Joseph Kincaid, and Logan is now suing to stay the proceedings at law.  Logan wins the case, and doesn't have to pay damages.

<scopecontent>
<p>The suits relate to a dispute between Idle, who brought a slave named Hagar to Virginia from Maryland in 1787, when she was a young girl, and Gaines, who bought rights to her from Idle's step-children, and debt. Case hinges on the location of the oath Idle is alleged to have signed when he brought Hagar to Virginia from Maryland. Idle accuses Gaines of trying to steal the oath he signed when he imported the slaves into Virginia, and petitions to have the suit moved from Grayson to Staunton; also accuses Gaines of trying to have Hagar liberated, so he won't have to give her up to Idle to pay a debt. Exhibits include record of charges of assault and battery made by Hagar against Frederick Idle. Numerous depositions.  She sued on grounds she had been brought into Virginia illegally in 1787 by Philip Gaines, one of the defendants, in violations of the law passed in 1785 to prevent the importation of slaves. Court upheld the Grayson court finding that Hagar was a slave, and ordered Gaines to deliver her and her children to Idle, as found in the detinue (order to return property) issued by the Grayson County court.

The surveyor in setting down in his field notes the second course of the said survey, through mistake as your orator alleges insisted the letter N instead of the letter S so that the course according to the abbreviation manner usual with surveyors, would read North seventy six degrees East instead of South so many degrees East.

<p>The orator (blacksmith) who was at the time an overseer of the poor took an apprentice a boy about seven years old named James Davis.   Davis lived with your orator about two years as an apprentice, but was too young to learn anything of the trade, not being large enough even to blow the balloons.  During this time, he was clothed and fed by your orator and treated with kindness and gave him attention.  Davis started running off into the neighborhood and loitering about from place to place staying away from home for several days and nights.  In order to break him of this vicious practice, your orator frequently threatened the boy telling him that the bears would catch him.  At length, your orator would whip him.

<scopecontent>
<p>A free negro named Sampson is codefendant. He asked Cravens, a Methodist minister, to purchase his wife and a male child, both slaves, from Smith Loffland. Sampson agreed to work for Cravens to pay off his debt to Cravens. Sampson's wife and child were held by Cravens as collateral. According to Cravens, Sampson worked off the debt. Cravens promised to take Sampson and his family to a free state should he move. Cravens planned to move to Indiana/Illinois and take Sampson and family with him. Sampson became indebted to John Morris prior to the move. Morris sued Sampson for repayment of debt. Morris visited Cravens informing Cravens of Sampson's debt. Cravens said that Sampson would repay debt but Sampson's wife and child were Cravens property and he was going to take them to Indiana/Illinois. Morris claimed that the Sampson's wife and child were the property of Sampson and not Cravens. Morris issued execution on Sampson's child Fanny for her to be sold as a slave by sheriff to recover his debt. Cravens' nephew John Cravens bought Fanny before Morris could. Morris claimed John Cravens did so unfairly and with William Cravens consent.  Cravens claimed his nephew did it on his own initiative with no encouragement by William Cravens. He was out of town at the time of sale. After being purchased, Fanny "disappeared and that she is probably at this time in the state of Indiana." Cravens claimed that he was the owner of Fanny and not Sampson; therefore, she should not have been sold to repay Sampson's debt to Morris. Cravens stated that the only reason he purchased Fanny was to grant her her freedom. His nephew accomplished this objective by removing Fanny to a state "where a slave was never known." Cravens agreement with Sampson was fulfilled and no longer claimed Fanny as his property. Cravens acknowledges that the only reason he purchased Sampson's family was to secure their freedom.

<scopecontent>
<p>Case of Daniel Webster (a former slave but a "freeman of color"). Slave in 1834 in the Commonwealth owned by David Hanger, requesting 300 dollars Hanger had left him in his will. Webster purchased a slave girl from L.L. Stevenson named Eliza with permission of his master Hanger. "Your orator is well aware the said girl became the property of his master, but his master had always permitted your orator to retain and treat said girl as his own property, ever since her purchase by your orator of Stevenson." Hanger sold Webster to John N.C. Stockton for $550 with the agreement that Stockton purchase Eliza as well. Also Webster could earn his freedom from Stockton after working for him for a certain period of time. Webster agreed to the transaction on the condition that he would receive his freedom. Stockton purchased Webster and moved to Florida. Stockton died before emancipating Webster. Before his death, Stockton refused to give Webster evidence of his freedom until they returned to VA. Stockton's heirs refuse to grant Webster his freedom. Webster won his freedom in Albemarle County court in 1840. Copy of suit used as exhibit. Hanger's executors refuse to give Webster the 300 dollars claiming Webster was a slave at the time of Hanger's death in 1837. Webster argues that although he was legally free in 1840 he was in fact free in 1835 or 1836 based on the agreement between Hanger and Stockton; therefore, he should receive the 300 dollars. The defendants claimed that the reason Hanger sold Webster to Stockton was because Webster attempted to poison Hanger in an effort to gain his freedom sooner. Hanger no longer concerned if Webster ever gained his freedom. Webster lost the case.

<p>During the French and Indian War, George Washington led a regiment of Virginia soldiers in the Battle of the Great Meadows, also known as the Battle of Fort Necessity, which would become Washington's only military defeat. After the battle, the soldiers were given a land grant that would become known as the Savage Grant in 1772 when Virginia governor John Savage made the grant legal. As commanding officer, Washington was in charge of surveying the land and directing the portions to which claimants were entitled. A letter written by Washington in 1772, not found in the suit, details Washington's involvement and his desire to be finished with the situation. In 1772, the interested parties were supposed to meet to divide and distribute the land. Very few of the recipients actually inhabited the land. They either sold the land to third parties or the land was taken away due to lack of improvements. The suits involve heirs who say their ancestors never received the land to which they were entitled. There are no decrees included in the case.
