         <head>Biographical Information</head>
         <p>Matthew Fontaine Maury was born near Fredericksburg,
         Virginia, 14 January 1806 to Richard Maury (1766-1843) and
         Diana Minor Maury (1768-1843). At five he moved with his
         family to Tennessee. In 1825, he received a midshipman's
         warrant and joined the United States navy. After nine years on
         active duty at sea, Maury returned to Virginia in 1834 and
         married Ann Hull Herndon (1811-1901) 15 July 1834. He settled
         in Fredericksburg and began writing articles on the navy. In
         1842, he was appointed superintendent of the Depot of Charts
         and Instruments of the Navy Department and began researching
         ocean winds and currents. His work resulted in time being cut
         off from sea voyages. In 1858, he was restored to active
         command with the rank of Commander. When the Civil War began,
         he resigned his commission 20 April 1861. He was appointed
         special agent to England by the Confederate government. While
         in England, he helped procure ships for the Confederacy and
         worked on electric mines. When the war ended, Maury offered
         his services to the Emperor Maximilian (1832-1867) to colonize
         former Confederates in Mexico. Colonization proved to be a
         failure and Maury returned to England in 1866, where he
         received an honorary degree from Cambridge University. Friends
         convinced him to return to the United States and in in 1868,
         he was appointed professor of meteorology at the Virginia
         Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia. Maury died in
         Lexington 1 February 1873 and was buried at Hollywood Cemetery
         in Richmond, Virginia. Maury and his wife had eight
         children.</p>

               and report. Maury comments on poor wind direction
               records. Provides instructions for proper notes. Maury
               discusses the currents off of Yucatan, tracks of vessels
