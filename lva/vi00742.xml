         <head>Biographical Information</head>
         <p>William Wirt was born 8 November 1772 in Bladensburg,
         Maryland, to Jacob Wirt (d. 1774) and Henrietta Wirt (d.
         1779). Orphaned, Wirt fortunately received help from an uncle
         and from a family friend and received an education. He studied
         law and settled in Culpeper County, Virginia, where he was
         admitted to the Virginia bar and practiced in Culpeper and
         Albemarle Counties where he lived from 1795 to 1799. He moved
         to Richmond, Virginia, in 1800 to continue his practice. He
         was elected clerk of the House of Delegates. In 1802, he was
         appointed chancellor of one of the three chancery districts
         and moved to Williamsburg, Virginia. In 1803, he resigned as
         chancellor and moved to Norfolk, Virginia, to continue his
         private law practice. Wirt returned to Richmond in 1806 and
         continued practicing law. He served as one of the prosecution
         in the Aaron Burr trial in 1807. In 1817, he was appointed
         Attorney-General of the United States by President James
         Monroe (1758-1831) and served for twelve years through
         Monroe's term and through the term of John Quincy Adams
         (1767-1848). In 1829, he retired to private life in Baltimore,
         Maryland. In 1832, Wirt was the presidential candidate of the
         Anti-Masonic party. Wirt wrote many works including LETTERS OF
         THE BRITISH SPY and a biography of Patrick Henry. Wirt died in
         Washington D.C. 18 February 1834, and was buried in the
         National (Congressional) Cemetery. William Wirt married first
         Mildred Gilmer (d. 1799) of Albemarle County 28 May 1795. He
         married second Elizabeth Washington Gamble (1784-1857) of
         Richmond 7 September 1802, and they had twelve children.</p>
