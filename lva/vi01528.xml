<head>Acquisition Information
</head>
<p>The original volume came to the Library of Virginia in a shipment of court papers from Orange County.  The microfilm copy of this volume was generated by The Genealogical Society of Utah--while filming in the Orange County Circuit Court Clerk's Office.
</p>
<p>The negative photostatic copy was compiled and created by the Virginia State Library's (now the Library of Virginia) Archives Division from the original volume found in the Orange County Circuit Court Clerk's Office.

<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Orange County was formed in 1734 from Spotsylvania County. According to most accounts, the county was named for William of Orange, the Dutch prince who became William III of England in 1688. It is more probable, however, that the name honored William IV, prince of Orange-Nassau, who married Anne, eldest daughter of George II, in 1734.
</p>
<p>Prior to 1853, when the Commonwealth began recording vital statistics, Virginia marriages were recorded at the county or city level. Beginning in 1661, in order to be married by license, the groom was required to go before the county clerk and give bond with security that there was no lawful reason to prevent the marriage. The license, issued then by the clerk, was given to the minister who performed the service.
Written consent from a parent or guardian was needed for individuals younger than twenty-one years.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Marriage Register No. 1, 1757-1867, is divided into two sections. The first section contains an unnumbered internal index to the volume (1757-1867.) Males and Females(A-Y) are listed separately. Names are arranged alphabetically by page number. The second section is essentially the register itself and covers pages 1-202, 1757-1867. This section records the date when the license was issued, the place of marriage
(usually the parish) and the full names of both parties. In addition, this section may also record the following information: whether the marriage was by license or banns (Marriage Banns, published in the parish church where the couple lived, constituted a legal substitute for a marriage license prior to 1848), names of witnesses, name of bondsman, wife's age and condition before marriage (spinster or widow), the couple's place of residence and the name of the wife's parents. By 1853, page 170, additional information was recorded--such as the age and condition of both the husband and wife before marriage, their places of birth,
their places of residence, their parents' names, the occupation of the husband and the name of the person performing the marriage ceremony and his religious denomination(noted by 1816.) From 1865-1867, pages 192-
202, the marriages of African Americans are recorded in this volume. Additional marriage records from 1772-1773 are found on page 203.
</p>
<p>Other marriage records, found in county deed, memorandum and fee books, are also referenced within the volume. Marriage records, dating from 1770-1774, recorded in the fly leaf of a county memorandum book are found on page 17 of the register. There are additional marriage records contained in Deed Book 11(as noted on page 1 of the register)--a marriage contract from 1748 is found on page 79 (see LVA microfilm reel 4.)  Additional marriage records, dating from 1756-1778, are found in Deed Book 17 (as noted on pages 2-8 of the register.) After the last page of Deed Book 17 (468), marriage records from 1772-1778 are found on pages
1- 4. These records note the date when the marriage license was issued, the names of both parties, whether the marriage was by license or banns and the place of residence of the parties. An incomplete list of marriage licenses recorded in county fee books is found on pages 7-8. These licenses, dating from 1756-1757, 1760-1761, 1770 and 1772-1773, record only the names of both parties.
