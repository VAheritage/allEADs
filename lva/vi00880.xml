<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>James Patton Preston was born at "Smithfield" in Montgomery County, Virginia, on 21 June 1774, the ninth child of Colonel William Preston and Susanna Smith. He was educated at the William &amp; Mary College
from 1790 to 1795. In 1799, Preston qualified as justice of the peace for Montgomery County. He married Nancy Taylor of Norfolk, Va., sister of Gen. Robert B. Taylor, on 13 June 1801. One of Preston's six
children, William Ballard Preston, became Secretary of the Navy in President Zachariah Taylor's Cabinet and a senator in the Confederate Congress. From 1801 to 1804, Preston served in the Virginia Senate. Preston
also represented Montgomery County in the House of Delegates from 1810 to 1812. During the War of 1812, he was commissioned lieutenant colonel of the 12th U. S. Infantry. On 15 August 1813, he was promoted to
colonel of the regiment and reassigned to the 23rd U. S. Infantry. Severely wounded at the battle of Chrysler's Farm on 13 November 1813, Preston was later discharged from the army on 15 June 1815.
</p>
<p>Preston returned to politics with his re-election to the House of Delegates on 11 November 1816. This term in the House was extremely short-lived as he was elected governor on 11 December 1816 to succeed Wilson
Cary Nicholas. Preston served the maximum three one-year terms as governor until 11 December 1819. Notable achievements during his governorship include the establishment of the University of Virginia, improvements
to Capitol Square, and the charting of Virginia's rivers &amp; counties. Following his governorship, President James Monroe appointed Preston postmaster for Richmond from 1824 to 1837. In 1837, he was chosen
president of a convention at Abingdon to plan a railroad from Lynchburg to Tennessee. He died on 4 May 1843 and is buried at a family plot at "Smithfield." Preston County, West Virginia, was named in his honor in
1818.

recently passed laws of Congress. On 29 July 1817, Richard Rush, Acting Secretary of State, encloses a resolution of the Senate to prepare &amp; report a statement relative to the regulations &amp; standards for
weights &amp; measures which may exist in the several states. John Quincy Adams encloses a resolution of Congress proposing an amendment to the Constitution against citizens to accept titles of nobility from a

Pettibone requesting aid for his improvements in the welding of cast steel to iron (1817 Feb. 24). Lastly, Henry Clay, Speaker of the House of Representatives, writes regarding the death of Peterson Goodwyn, a
Virginia Congressman (1818 March 19).
