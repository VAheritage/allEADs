<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Business Records, both volumes and loose records, are in some cases transferred to the Library of Virginia as components of court record transfers. These business records in some cases were simply stored in the local court building for safe keeping by business owners. In other cases, business records (particularly ledgers, account books, etc.) may have been filed in a court case as an exhibit. These business record exhibits appeared both in chancery causes and in judgments, these records serving as exhibits for business dissolution cases, debut suits, and contract disputes. 
</p>
<p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph>Orange County according to most accounts, was named for William of Orange, the Dutch Prince who became King William III of England in 1688. It is more probably, however, that it was named for William IV, prince of Orange-Nassau, who married Anne, eldest daughter of King George II, in 17340the year that Orange County was formed from Spotsylvania County. The county court first met on 21 January 1735. The county seat is Orange.</p>
