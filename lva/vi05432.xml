</head>
<p>John T. Harris was born on 8 May 1823 in Albemarle County to Nathan and Ann Anderson Harris. In 1845, he was admitted to the bar and married Virginia Maupin Miller in 1855. From 1852 to 1859 he served as commonwealth's attorney for Rockingham County and in 1856 was a Presidential elector for James Buchanan. In 1859, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives and served until the outbreak of the Civil War. Despite his strong Unionist sentiments and his continual efforts to keep Virginia in the Union, Harris remained loyal to Virginia when she seceded in May of 1861. During the war he served two terms in the Virginia General Assembly. Following the war John T. Harris was judge of the 12th judicial circuit, which included Rockingham County. In 1870, he was again elected to Congress and was continuously re-elected until 1880, after which he resumed his law practice in Harrisonburg. John T. Harris returned to politics in 1889 as a rival of Philip W. McKinney for the Democratic nomination for governor. Later he was appointed by Governor McKinney as one of the representatives for Virginia to the World's Columbian Exposition in 1892. He died in Harrisonburg on 14 Octo

<p>The Randolph family papers came into the Harris family when John T. Harris's son, John T. Harris, Jr. married Peyton Randolph's daughter, Mary Elizabeth Randolph. Born in Washington, D.C. in 1833, Peyton was the son of James Innes Randolph, a congressional clerk, and Susan Armistead Randolph. Prior to the Civil War he attended Columbian College (now George Washington University) and was an engineer on numerous railroad projects in Virginia, Indiana, and Alabama through the 1850's. He enlisted in the army in Mobile, Alabama at the outbreak of war and served as an engineer in Pickett's division, rising to the rank of major by 1865. He married Mary Fisher following the war, returned to the engineering profession, and died 28 November 1888.
