      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Henrico County was one of the eight original shires, or counties, first enumerated in 1634.  The county was named for Henry, Prince of Wales, eldest son of James I.
</p>
      <p>Historically, after Emancipation, African Americans established separate congregations and church facilities to create their own communities and worhip in their own culturally distinct ways. African American churches have long been the centers of communities, serving as schools in the early years after the Civil War and taking up social welfare functions, such as providing for the indigent. The Moore Street Missionary Baptist Church was organized in March 1875 by members of the 2nd Baptist Church. The church was organized to give facilities to a section known as "Sheep Hill." Now known as the Carver neighborhood, it became a thriving black community and is now part of the Greater Richmond area.
</p>
      <p>On March 17th 1875, church deacons purchased an old soap factory consisting of three buildings on a lot on Moore Street. The center building was used as a church. The church was dedicated on April 18, 1875 and the congregation was officially recognized. The first pastor Rev. William Troy, 1875-1881, was a student at the Virginia Union Theological Seminary. In 1878, elaborate improvements were made to the building including galleries. In 1878, the deacons decided to run an industrial school in connection with the church and in April 1880, two-thirds of the church property was deeded to the Moore Street Industrial School. The school was a community response to the needs of African American children.
</p>
      <p>The transference of the deed of the property from the church to the school caused the congregation trouble and resulted in a long suit which was finally settled in favor of the church. The property was returned to the church in 1901. The noise of the nearby railways caused the congregation to move to their present site. The church was dedicated on May 31, 1908. The Ministers' Aid Society was funded by a fee paying membership. The organization combined church and charity--providing aid and helping people adjust to and deal with the demands of life through religion.
</p>
      <p>The minute book and ledger were used as evidence in the chancery case, Charles J. Clarke and others versus John Oliver and others and John W. Williams versus Coleman Smith, trustee, and others, heard in the Circuit Court of Henrico County.
