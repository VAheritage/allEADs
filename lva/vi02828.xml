<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Henry County was named for Patrick Henry, revolutionary leader and the first governor of the commonwealth of Virginia.  It was formed from Pittsylvania County in 1776.
</p>
<p>Throughout the Civil War, the principal responsibility for Virginia's indigent soldiers' families lay with the locality. The Virginia State Convention in 1861 gave the responsibility entirely to counties and incorporated towns and authorized whatever actions had already been taken. Acts of Assembly in 1862 and 1863 expanded the localities' powers to provide for their needy, and in 1863 some minimal state assistance was added in. At first relief was provided as money, but as the monetary system collapsed, relief was distributed in kind. Agents of the court maintained lists of eligible families, gathered goods for distribution and paid for them, and impressed supplies if necessary. Virginia was unique amongst the southern states in that it assigned the provisioning of needy families almost solely to the locality.</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Henry County (Va.) Provisions for Families of Indigent Soldiers is primarily made up of reports of indigent soldiers' families. These reports include the names of soldiers and family members, the amount of money or supplies provided to each family, and the use for which the money was intended. Also included are lists of soldiers' families, receipts for provisions purchased and accounts of overseers demonstrating funds distributed in various county districts and details about the families living in those districts.  Information included in the accounts include number and age of children, economic state and health of family (e.g. "she is poor, lives with her father" or "in good condition-dropped from list) and details about the soldiers. The reports and receipts record that funds were to be used for specific foods such as bacon, wheat, beef, flour and corn.  Also included is one file of papers relating to court cases involving non-payment of funds for provisions for indigent soldiers' families.
