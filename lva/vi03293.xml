<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Bedford County was named probably for John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford, who served as secretary of state for the southern department from 1748 to 1751 and had general supervision of colonial affairs. It was formed from Lunenburg County in 1753, and parts of Albemarle and Lunenburg Counties were added in 1755. The county court first met on 5 May 1754. The county seat is the city of Bedford. 
</p>
<p>The separate office of coroner appeared in Virginia about 1660. The judicial duty of the office is to hold inquisitions in cases when persons meet sudden, violent, unnatural or suspicious death, or death without medical attendance.  The coroner would summon a jury to assist him in determining cause of death.  Prior to November 1877, the jurors numbered twelve.  Between November 1877 and March 1926, the jurors numbered six.   The jury viewed the body of the deceased and heard the testimony of witnesses.  The coroner was required to write down witness testimony.  After seeing and hearing the evidence, the jury delivered in writing to the coroner their conclusion concerning cause of death referred to as the inquisition.  After March 1926, only the coroner determined cause of death.  He could require physicians to assist him with determing cause of death.  If a criminal act was determined to be the cause of death, the coroner was to deliver the guilty person to the sheriff and the Coroners' inquests would be used as evidence in the criminal trial.

I cut him one lick with the switch on his legs, and he sprang out the door and ran towards the woods.  I have not seen him since.  Every effort has been made by myself and my husband to find him.  It was frequently necessary to whip him, but was never whipped by either myself or my husband with anything but a switch and never severely or in any way abused."  Dr. T.W. Nelson said "there were scars on him which indicate his having been whipped, but not sufficient to be presumed to be the cause of his death."

Robinson left us for some minutes and returned with a rope and white garment that he had gotten from Mr. Brugh.  Hunter Clark testified, "I was at the Negro church at Montvale, Va.  The entertainment closed at 10:15 PM.  I left with John Minter and the two Flood girls.  Just before we got to the creek at Rice's Mill, I ran against a white garment tied to a rope, which was stretched across the road.  The rope flew up and struck my hat.  I pulled my pistol out and fired three times at random in direction of the bluff with my back toward the creek.  Then I undid one end of the rope from a sapling while Minter undid the other end.  When we had gotten about fifteen or twenty feet further, I heard a pistol shot from the direction of the bluff.  The ball passed between Minter and myself.  I turned and fired again in the direction of the bluff.  I heard nothing more."  Minter testified, "I was badly frightened, as was Hunter also."  Robinson came to his death from a wound inflicted by a 32 caliber pistol in the hands of Hunter Clark.  Clark, in fright, having discharged his pistol promiscuously.
