         <head>Biographical Information</head>
         <p>Thomas Mann Randolph was born 1 October 1768 at Tuckahoe in
         Henrico County, Virginia, to Thomas Mann Randolph (1740-1793)
         and Anne Cary Randolph (1745-1789). Educated by private tutors
         until age 16, Randolph studied at the University of Edinburg
         from 1785 to 1788. He returned to Virginia and settled in
         Albemarle County, Virginia, eventually establishing his home
         at Edgehill. Randolph served in the Virginia Senate from 1793
         to 1794. He was elected to the United States Congress and
         served from 1803 to 1807. When the War of 1812 began, he
         became colonel of the 20th Regiment of the United States Army
         and took part in an invasion of Canada. Later in the war, he
         served as a lieutenant colonel in the Virginia militia.
         Randolph was elected to the House of Delegates in 1819, and
         was elected Governor of Virginia that December. After his term
         ended in 1822, Randolph returned to the House of Delegates in
         1823 and served until 1825. He married Martha Jefferson
         (1772-1836), daughter of Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), 23
         February 1790, and they had twelve children. Randolph died at
         Monticello 20 June 1828, and was buried in the Jefferson
         family plot.</p>
