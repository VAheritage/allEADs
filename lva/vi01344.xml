<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Brunswick County was formed from Prince George County in 1720, but, because of the sparse population, county government was not organized until 1732. In the latter part of 1732, Brunswick County was enlarged by
the addition of parts of Surry and Isle of Wight Counties.
</p>
<p>The County Court was the original colonial court of adjudication and recordation, and it was the principal tribunal for the administration of local justice. The individual justices could act on small claims
matters as well as criminal matters where imminent bodily harm was a possibility, there being an appeal to the full County Court, which met monthly. This court ceased to exist in 1904 and the recordation function
was transferred to the circuit court.
</p>
<p>The Superior Court of Law was created in 1808. It met twice a year in each county, presided over by a circuit-riding General Court judge. Records were filed with the County Court. It had civil and criminal
jurisdiction. The court ceased to exist in 1831.
</p>
<p>The Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery, established in 1831, were the upper courts on the local level. Sessions were held twice a year in each county, presided over by a General Court judge. The
counties were grouped into districts for the convenience of the judge. The court ceased to exist in 1851.
</p>
<p>The Circuit Court was authorized by the Constitution of 1851 and established by an act of the General Assembly passed in May 1852. Courts were held twice yearly in each county, presided over by 21 judges who
rode circuits in the area of their jurisdiction. The records were filed with County Court records. These courts were granted original jurisdiction concurrrent with that of the County Courts, as well as appellate
jurisdiction in all civil cases of more than fifty dollars and criminal cases not "expressly cognizable in some other court," including those involving loss of life.
