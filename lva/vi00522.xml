         <p>William Stewart, Jr. began his career in his youth working
         as a clerk for Archibald McCall and Catherine Flood McCall in
         Tappahannock. In November 1800, the McCalls sent Stewart to
         Alexandria to manage Catherine's nail factory and blacksmith
         shop. He had numerous responsibilities such as overseeing the
         hired slaves who worked in the factory or for people in
         Alexandria, placing and filling orders, purchasing equipment
         for the factory or personal goods and items for the McCalls,
         scheduling deliveries, and keeping the account books. In
         January 1815, Stewart and Miss McCall reached an agreement
         that transferred control of the business from her to him. For
         a short period of time, Stewart operated the factory in
         partnership with John Creighton. In 1816, Stewart was forced
         to sell out his share of the factory to Creighton and William
         Gilham because of mounting personal debt. Stewart died in
         February 1819 of a combination of illness and emotional
         depression.</p>
         <p>Catherine Flood McCall was born in Essex County, Virginia
         on December 25, 1766. She was the daughter of Archibald
         McCall, a prominent merchant and landowner in Essex County.
         Both lived on a plantation near the town of Tappahannock. With
         her father's guidance, Catherine used her wealth and slave
         property to start a nail factory and blacksmith shop in
         Alexandria in 1798. They started a second factory in Richmond
         in 1806, transferring a number of slaves from Alexandria to
         work in it. Soon afterwards, Catherine and her father moved
         from Tappahannock to Richmond maintaining residences in both
         locations. Catherine died on March 9, 1828 in Georgetown.</p>
         <p>The letters in this collection were used as evidence in a
         chancery suit entitled Administrator of William Stewart, Jr.
         versus Catherine Flood McCall and others that was heard in the
         Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for Alexandria
         County. The purpose of the letters was to prove that Stewart
         did not have complete authority to act on her behalf. He had
         to have the approval of herself or her father in order to sell
         slaves, hire slaves, purchase machinery, take out loans,
         etc.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>Collection of letters dated from 1800 to 1818 that were
         either written by, written to, or about William Stewart, Jr.,
         manager of a nail factory and blacksmith shop in Alexandria
         owned by Catherine Flood McCall. The collection consists
         largely of correspondence written by Stewart to McCall. The
         major themes found in Stewart's letters to Catherine McCall
         include: his affectionate feelings for McCall and desire to
         marry her; business matters related to McCall's nail factories
         in Alexandria and Richmond and her plantation in Tappahannock;
         his difficulties with McCall's slaves who worked for him at
         the factory; his constant lack of money to pay his personal
         debts; his efforts to make additional income outside the
         factory (one effort led to his being sued by the United States
         government for violating the Embargo Act of 1807); his
         repeated requests to be given total authority over McCall's
         financial interests; his poor health, both emotional and
         physical; and his great unhappiness with his life in
         Alexandria.</p>
         <p>The collection includes correspondence between Stewart and
         Archibald McCall, father and business manager of Catherine.
         The correspondence mostly deals with business matters such as
         factory production, inventories of stock, sales, expenses,
         machinery used to make nails, labor issues (hiring of slaves,
         Stewart's difficulties with slaves, need for additional
         workers, etc.), and issues surrounding Catherine McCall's nail
         factory in Richmond.</p>
         <p>Stewart often mentions Catherine McCall's slaves in his
         letters. A total of twenty-four were sent from the McCall
         plantation to work at the nail factory in Alexandria as
         blacksmiths and nailors or they were hired out by Stewart to
         people in the city. Stewart writes about his bitter
         relationship with slaves; the work they performed either at
         the factory or for others; slave escapes and efforts by
         Stewart to return them; forms of punishment Stewart meted out
         to slaves for poor work or for escaping; expenses related to
         upkeep of slaves in Alexandria; amount Stewart charged for
         hiring slaves to people in Alexandria; value of McCall's slave
         property; and his constant request that they be sold because
         of their behavior and expense.</p>
         <p>The collection contains very emotional letters written by
         Catherine McCall to Stewart shortly before his death
         expressing her deep affection for Stewart and encouraging him
         to overcome his depression and illness. Following Stewart's
         death, she writes Stewart's friends in Alexandria concerning
         matters related to disposal of his property.</p>
         <p>The collection also includes correspondence from Stewart's
         brother, Catherine McCall's cousin in New England, and several
         gentlemen Stewart conducted business with. There are several
         letters from the Catherine McCall's plantation overseer
         informing Stewart of matters regarding the plantation. There
         is one letter from an acquaintance encouraging Stewart to
         replace slaves on McCall's plantation with Redemptioners.</p>
         <p>On the back of each letter is a summary of the letter's
         contents written by Catherine McCall.</p>
