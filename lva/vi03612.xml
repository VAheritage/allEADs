      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Chesterfield County was named for Philip Dormer Stanhope, fourth earl of Chesterfield, British statesman and diplomat, and was formed from Henrico County in 1749.  Its area is 446 square miles, and the county seat is Chesterfield.
</p>
      <p> The separate office of coroner appeared in Virginia about 1660.  The judicial duty of the office is to hold inquisitions in cases when persons meet sudden, violent, unnatural or suspicious death, or death without medical attendance.  The coroner would summon a jury to assist him in determining cause of death.  Prior to November 1877, the jurors numbered twelve.  Between November 1877 and March 1926, the jurors numbered six.  The jury viewed the body of the deceased and heard the testimony of witnesses.  The coroner was required to write down witness testimony.  After seeing and hearing the evidence, the jury delivered in writing to the coroner their conclusion concerning cause of death referred to as inquisition.  After March 1926, only the coroner determined cause of death.  He could require physicians to assist him with determining cause of death.  If a criminal act was determined to be the cause of death, the coroner was to deliver the guilty person to the sheriff and the coroner's inquests would be used as evidence in the criminal trial. </p>

          <p>This contains and inquest and a protest to the original inquest.  The inquest states a black female slave Lucy owned by Henry Winfrees, although severely whipped, they (the jurors) "do not believe that to have been sufficient to have occasioned her death". 
</p>
          <p> The same jurors filed a protest document to their original inquest revising their opinion of the cause of death of Lucy.  The jurors state the following in  there protest document that "Upon Mature Deliberation of our inquiry we are of the opinion that we have made an improper return and are now induced to believe that the abuse which the said Lucy received was the means of her death and therefore pray the inference of the court on behalf of the Commonwealth that they may direct another inquest be taken on the body aforesaid in order that complete justice may be done in the case aforesaid and we hope that the court will receive this as our protest against our own acting and doing while under solemn oath."
