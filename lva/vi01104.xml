         <head>Biographical Information</head>
         <p>Francis Walker Gilmer was born 9 October 1790 at "Pen Park"
         in Albemarle County, Virginia, to George Gilmer (1742-1795)
         and Lucy Walker Gilmer (1751-1800). He received some of his
         education at Monticello from Martha Jefferson Randolph
         (1772-1836) and at a school run by James Ogilvie (1760-1820).
         Gilmer attended the College of William and Mary in 1809-1810,
         then studied law under William Wirt (1772-1834) in Richmond,
         Virginia. Upon the completion of his legal studies, he
         travelled extensively along the eastern seaboard with the Abbe
         Joseph Francisco Correa de Serra (1750-1823) before beginning
         the practice of law in Winchester, Virginia, in 1816. A year
         later, Gilmer returned to Richmond to continue practicing law.
         In 1824, he was chosen by Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) to
         travel to Europe to hire professors for the newly established
         University of Virginia. Gilmer himself was appointed professor
         of law, but he died before he could assume his position on 25
         February 1826 at "Farmington" in Albemarle County.</p>

         <p>Letters, 1816-1821, from Francis Walker Gilmer (1790-1826)
         of Winchester and Richmond, Virginia, to Thomas Walker Gilmer
         (1802-1844) of Albemarle County, Virginia, in which Francis
         Walker Gilmer offers his nephew Thomas Walker Gilmer advice on
         his education and critiques his literary style and penmanship.
         Gilmer encourages his nephew to read certain works and to
         study hard in mathmatics, languages, literature, and oration.
         He comments on deportment and character and on what is
         necessary to make a name for one's self. Francis Gilmer
         encourages Thomas Gilmer to undertake the study of law. Also a
         letter from Francis Walker Gilmer to George Gilmer
         (1778-1836), Francis' brother and Thomas' father, on familial
         and brotherly relations.</p>
