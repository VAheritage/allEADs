<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>From the McGuireWoods Consulting website, accessed 11 September 2013: Chris Lloyd leads the McGuireWoods Consulting infrastructure and economic development team where he specializes in site selection and economic development incentives negotiations. [Lloyd] has also worked closely with clients on numerous public-private partnership projects for transportation and other infrastructure as well as playing a leading role in the development and passage of Virginia's public-private partnership laws. These statutes have since become model legislation for use in other states. As a result of this work, [Lloyd] has become a frequent speaker on economic development policy issues and public private partnership projects around the country. Prior to joining McGuireWoods Consulting, [Lloyd] served for nearly five years in the Office of the Secretary of Commerce and Trade under Virginia Governors Allen and Wilder. In this position, he was responsible for legislative, budgetary, and regulatory coordination and development for the fifteen agencies within that Secretariat which oversees the state's economic development programs.
