<p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph></p>
      
<p>"Free Negro" Registers</p>

<p>In 1793, the Virginia General Assembly specified that "free Negroes or mulattoes" were required to be registered and numbered in a book to be kept by the town clerk, which shall specify "age, name, colour, and stature, by whom, and in what court the said negro or mulatto was emancipated; or that such negro or mulatto was born free." The process was extended to counties in 1803. Although some clerks were already recording such features, an 1834 Act of Assembly made it a uniform requirement to record identifying marks and scars and the instrument of emancipation, whether by deed or will. This bound register often coincided with a loose certificate containing largely the same identifying information. Both the registration system and the process of renewal was enforced differently in the various Virginia localities. Thus, the information found in these registers may differ from year to year and across localities.</p>

<p>The register books resulting from the administration of the 1793 and 1803 Act of Assembly are evidence of Virginia legislators' reaction to a quickly growing free Black and multiracial population in Virginia in the post Revolutionary War period. Acts such as these allowed white officials to police the activities and movement of free Black community members throughout the state thereby restricting their autonomy.</p>


<p>"Free Negro" Registrations</p>

<p>In 1793, the Virginia General Assembly specified that "free Negroes or mulattoes" were required to "be registered and numbered in a book to be kept by the town clerk, which shall specify age, name, color, status and by whom, and in what court emancipated." These entries often coincided with the creation of a loose certificate containing largely the same identifying information.</p>

<p>Documents in this record group differ from the bound volumes referred to as "registers." These registration records typically appear in the form of certificates or handwritten statements recording the free status of a Black or multiracial person. They can include the free person's name, sometimes age, a brief physical description, and the circumstances of the person's freedom or emancipation, parents, former enslaver, place or date of emancipation. There are also affidavits that were given by individuals affirming a free person's status, as well as written descriptions of free people. In some cases, a person would not have a registration to submit to the court. Instead they produced some other form of identification proving their free status, for example, a deed of emancipation, a will, an apprenticeship indenture, or an affidavit of someone testifying to their character and status.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>

 <p>Lunenburg County (Va.) Records Related to the Registration of Free Persons, 1800-1865, consists of two free register volumes, 1800-1865.</p>

<p>The first volume, "Will Book No. 5 and List of Free Negroes and Mulattoes Registered in the County of Lunenburg," 1800-1850, kept by the clerk of the circuit court firstly acts as Will Book No. 5, 1800-1802. This portion of the volume contains a 2 pages index for the wills and then approximately 89 pages of recorded wills. Following this portion of the volume begins the "List of Free Negroes and Mulattoes Registered in the County of Lunenburg."</p>

<p>The second volume, "Register of Free Negroes," 1850-1865, records the registration of free Black and multiracial people of Black descent in Lunenburg County and covers the years 1850 to 1865. The clerk recorded name, age, height, complexion, marks or scars, and in what court the person was emancipated or whether the person was born free. There is an index. It includes page numbers. In some instances, the clerk recorded information not required by law such as the name of the former enslaver, previous place of registration, or place of birth.</p>

<p>Lastly, includes a registration, 1865, of Drury Cooper, "a free mulatto."</p>
