      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Daniel Morgan was born in 1736, probably in New Jersey.
         After quarreling with his father, Morgan moved to the
         Shenandoah Valley. After working several years as a laborer
         and a teamster, Morgan became an independent wagoner and in
         that role accompanied Edward Braddock's futile expedition
         against Fort Pitt in 1755. Morgan later served as a lieutenant
         during Pontiac's Rebellion. Commissioned a captain of a rifle
         company 22 June 1775, Morgan took his command and joined the
         Continental Army outside of Boston, Massachusetts. He joined
         Benedict Arnold's expedition against Quebec and assumed
         command after Arnold was wounded. During an assault on Quebec,
         Morgan surrendered after other troops failed to support his
         advance. After his release, Morgan was appointed a colonel 12
         November 1776. He served ably under Washington and with
         Horatio Gates at the battle of Saratoga, New York. He retired
         in 1779, but returned to active duty in 1780 with a
         brigadier-general's commission. He commanded the American
         troops at the battle of Cowpens 17 January 1781, defeating the
         British in a major engagement. Shortly after, he retired due
         to poor health. After the Revolution ended, Morgan helped
         several of his former soldiers who were in need. He commanded
         the Virginia militia during the Whiskey Rebellion and was
         later elected to Congress in 1797 and served one term. He
         married Abigail Bailey and had two daughters. Morgan died 6
         July 1802 in Winchester, Virginia, and is buried at Mount
         Hebron Cemetery.</p>
