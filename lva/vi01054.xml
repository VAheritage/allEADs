         <p>For many years, The Library of Virginia had no definitive
         home. Valuable early records were kept at Jamestown as early
         as 1676 and were then moved to the College of William and Mary
         for a brief period at the century's end. By 1780, extant
         records were moved to the Capitol in Richmond.</p>
         <p>Coincidentally, in 1779, the Virginia General Assembly was
         presented among its legislation, "A Bill for Establishing a
         Public Library" drawn up by Thomas Jefferson. The bill
         provided for 2000 pounds yearly to be expended to maintain a
         Library in Richmond. The facility was to be a reference
         library only without books being lent for home use. Perhaps
         ahead of its time, the bill failed to pass.</p>
         <p>The Virginia State Library was created by an act passed by
         the General Assembly on January 23, 1823, to establish a
         public library with funds derived from the sale of William W.
         Hening's THE STATUTES AT LARGE. From 1823 to 1828, the Library
         was under the control of the governor and council. In 1828,
         the General Assembly created a joint committee on the library
         (located in a room in the southeastern corner of the Capitol)
         to oversee its administration. Use of the State Library was
         restricted to members of the state government in a policy that
         continued until at least 1856. The Secretary of the
         Commonwealth served ex officio as state librarian from 1832 to
         1903.</p>
         <p>The growth of the State Library was somewhat erratic. Book
         holdings increased from 1,313 in 1828 to 17,480 in 1856. Lack
         of funds and politics frequently intermingled to slow library
         development. General W.H. Richardson, State Librarian in 1852,
         became embroiled in an effort to remove him "to make way for
         some politician of democratic principles." At the close of
         Reconstruction, Dr. George William Bagby, then State
         Librarian, was terminated and his position abolished at the
         hands of Readjusters.</p>
         <p>Eventually, on May 15, 1903, the General Assembly passed an
         act that created a library board to administer the library,
         authorized the deposit of public records in the library,
         provided for the publication of historical records by the
         library, and established a library fund for the purchase of
         books and private papers. The Library Board, which was
         responsible for naming the State Librarian, was itself
         appointed by the Board of Education. The General Assembly
         passed an act on March 29, 1944, transferring the power to
         appoint the Library Board to the governor.</p>
         <p>While many public records somehow survived the
         Commonwealth's early years, many losses occurred due to fires,
         the ravages of war and negligence. When the library was moved,
         for example, in 1895 to a building separate from the Capitol,
         "chutes were constructed from the upper story of the Capitol
         to facilitate the delivery of books to the wagons of the junk
         dealer who had bought them." The move was poorly planned and
         the library's contents suffered great loss at the hands of
         those very authorities assigned to protect them.</p>
         <p>The new facility quickly was found to be inadequate and
         efforts were made both in 1910 and 1920 to construct a proper
         building for the State Library and its collections. Ground was
         broken for the current facility on December 7, 1938. At last,
         on December 23, 1940, the newly completed Virginia State
         Library was opened to the public.</p>
         <p>The Virginia State Library adopted the name, the Virginia
         State Library and Archives, in early 1987 to more adequately
         reflect its mission and purpose today. In July 1, 1994 the
         name was changed to The Library of Virginia. It serves as a
         general reference and research library, as the official
         repository of state archives and publications, and as a
         repository of state and federal documents. It provides
         assistance and advice to libraries around the state, and it
         administers state and federal library funds. The Archives and
         Records Division of the library administers the state records
         management program, arranges and describes records deposited
         in the division, and provides assistance and advice to state
         and local government agencies concerning the management of
         their records. Additionally, the agency produces many
         publications. The most notable among those regularly issued
         are the quarterly VIRGINIA CAVALCADE and the annual accession
         reports of the Archives and Records Division showing its most
         recent records and manuscript acquisitions.</p>
