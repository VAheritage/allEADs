<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The Wormley family is a prominent African American family from Middlesex County, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. As far as can be determined, Lynch Wormley (ca. 1780-1855) was the son of Ralph Wormeley V (1744-1806), a plantation owner of Rosegill, Middlesex County, Virginia, and an unidentified black woman. The Wormeley family descends from John Wormeley (born middle part of 12th century) of Knutsford, County Cheshire, England.</p>
<p>Lynch Wormley (aka Pere Leigh Wormley) and his wife, Mary Wormley (ca. 1786-1804), moved to Washington D.C. from Middlesex County, Virginia, around 1814. He owned and operated a livery stable and the Liberia Hotel in the city and had ten children: William, John, Owen, Harriet, Betsey Elizabeth, Samuel, Mary, James, Andrew, and an unidentified daughter. </p>
<p>William Wormley (ca. 1800-1855) was a hack driver and married to Louisa King (b. ca. 1800). John Wormley (ca. 1800-1840) and Owen B. Wormley (1808-1834) were both unmarried and lived in Washington, D.C. Harriet Wormley (b. ca. 1806) married James Johnson on 10 June 1830. Elizabeth "Betsey" married John Browne and was the mother of the famous black educator, Hugh Browne (1851-1923). Hugh Browne studied at Princeton Theological School and was ordained as a minister of the Presbyterian Church. He taught at the College of Liberia in Africa and returned to America teaching at M Street High School, Hampton Institute, Institute for Colored Youth in Pennsylvania, and started the Training School for Teachers. Samuel Wormely (ca. 1811-1864) was a boat stewart and married to Remetha Williams. Mary M. Wormley (ca. 1816-1835) was unmarried and lived in Washington, D.C. Andrew Wormley (ca. 1822-1878) married Mary Jane Smith (ca. 1830-1895), was a billiard parlor operator and musician, and lived in Washington, D.C.  </p>
<p>James Wormley, the ninth child of Lynch and Mary Wormley, was born 16 January 1819 in Washington, D.C., and died 18 October 1884 in Boston, Massachusetts. He married Anna Thompson (1823-1892) of Norfolk, Virginia on 30 January 1841. James owned and operated the popular Wormley Hotel in Washington, D.C. During the drawn-out, disputed Presidential Election of 1876, Wormley's Hotel became the venue for the secret meetings between emissaries from the Hayes and Tilden camps. The meetings culminated on 26 February 1877 in which the Wormley Agreement settled the stalemate in favor of Rutherford B. Hayes. Wormley cultivated friendships with many politicians and city business leaders, including U.S. Senator Charles Sumner, and was an activist for black public education. James and Anna  had four children: William Henry Ashburton, James Thompson, Garrett Smith, and Anna Matilda Wormley. </p>
<p>James Thompson Wormley (1844-1927), second son of James and Anna Wormley, was the first graduate of the Howard University Pharmaceutical School in 1870 and owned the first black drug store in Washington, D.C. He married Josephine Slade in 1865 and Mary A.A. Ringgold (1845-1922) in 1870. </p>
<p>Garrett Smith Wormley (1846-1903), third son of James and Anna Wormley, worked as a caterer and confectioner in Washington, D.C. He married Amelia E. Brent (1847-1922) in 1866. </p>
<p>Anna Matilda Wormley (1850-1929), daughter of James and Anna Wormley, married J. William Cole. </p>
<p>William Henry Ashburton Wormley (1842-1908), first son of James and Anna Wormley, was a U.S. Marshall and lived in Washington, D.C. He was married three times: Rachel Slade (1843-1865) in 1862; Adelaide Shadd (1846-1890) in 1867; and Sara E. Ford (1863-1924) in 1892. Adelaide Shadd was the daughter of Absalom Shad (1815-1857) and Eliza Julia Brockett (1829-1898). Absalom Shad ran a hotel in Washington D.C., but around the early 1850's moved the family to Canada so that the family could be brought up in freedom. Adelaide Shadd Wormley's cousin was Mary Ann Camberton Shadd (1824-1893), a famous abolitionist, newspaper owner, and lawyer. </p>
<p>Miriam Hunster Wormley (1889-1980), daughter of William Henry Ashburton and Adelaide Shadd Wormley, married Clarence F. Lewis. She was a teacher at Shaw Junior High in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Lawrence Riggs Wormley (1885-1962), son of William H.A. and Adelaide Shadd Wormley, married Mary Elizabeth Burruss (1885-1938) of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. They lived in Washington, D.C. and had a son, Stanton Lawrence Wormley. Stanton L. Wormley was born in 1909 in Washington, D.C. and died in 1993. He married first Margaret Just in 1936; second Alcibia Robinson; and third Freida Alma Hare (1922-2005). Stanton L. Wormley attended Howard University and received his Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1939. He taught at Virginia State College from 1932 to 1938 and Howard University from 1938 to 1971. He was the German and Russian Department Head and served as president of Howard University 1967-1969. He was the author of many published books and articles and also served as a consultant for the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of State. He retired from Howard University in 1971. Their son, Stanton L. Wormley, Jr. (b. 1951) is a computer software specialist and free lance writer.  </p>
<p>Francis L. Cardoza (1837-1903) was the son of a Jewish businessman of Charleston, South Carolina, and his free black wife. He attended the University of Glasgow in Scotland and moved to Connecticut, where he served as a Congressional minister. In 1865 Cardoza returned to Charleston to teach for the American Missionary Association and was instrumental in establishing the Avery Normal Institute, a school that trained black school teachers. He married Catherine Romena Howell of Connecticut in 1864. Cardoza was elected to the constitutional convention of 1868 and became the first black state official in South Carolina's history, holding the positions of Secretary of State (1868-1872) and Secretary of Treasurer (1872-1876). In 1876 the Democrats launched a campaign of violence and his work for the state was called into question. He was cleared of any charges and in 1878 was appointed a clerkship in the Treasury Department in Washington, D.C. In 1884 he became the principal of the Colored High School of Washington, D.C. </p>

Unfortunately a full name index is not included in the collection, so some cross checking of various files is necessary to obtain all the information on a given family member. Following is a more in-depth description in the series level scope and content notes.</p>

<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
<head>Arrangement
</head>
<p>The papers were originally organized into 83 photograph albums and arranged into five subgroups following the "Index to the Wormley Family Papers," compiled by Stanton L. Wormley, Sr., Stanton L. Wormley, Jr., and Paul E. Sluby, Sr., 1981. The original arrangement was maintained, the five subgroups becoming five series (Miscellaneous Information; Information on Individuals and Family Groups; Lineal Information and Charts; Photographs; and Supplemental Volumes). Papers were removed from each photograph album and placed in individual folders according to title of the album. The final arrangement follows the exact order of the "Index to the Wormley Family Papers." Most of the papers were photocopies and for albums in which the copies could not be removed due to the glue, the albums were photocopied and these new copies serve as the final product. The album pages were also numbered and that system was maintained throughout. The index lists the papers contained in each folder (album) but there is not a full name index key for the collection.
