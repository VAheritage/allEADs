</head>
<p>Charles Reid (1800-1899) of Norfolk, Virginia, was born in Forfar, Scotland, on 4 April 1800, the son of George Reid and Elizabeth Taylor Reid. He married Lucretia Nash (1799-1868) of Norfolk County, Virginia, on 17 March 1825. The couple had at least three sons and two daughters. Their son George C. Reid married Alice Harrison Grant; they were the parents of Cornelia Grant Reid (14 December 1893-16 May 1994), who married George L. Kerns in 1918. Their children included Alice Reid Kerns (2 April 1921-14 July 1996), who married Stanley Grams and had two children, Laura and Thomas; and Cornelius Reid Kerns (31 March 1923-10 February 1945), a B-29 navigator who was killed in action in the Pacific during World War II.
