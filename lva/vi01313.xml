      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>William Cobbs Letters, 1827-1841, consist of correspondence used as evidence in the Lynchburg, Va., Chancery cause styled John Motley &amp; wife, Etc. vs. John P. Cobbs, Etc. which excuses William of inadequately fulfilling his role as executor to Robert Cobbs, his father's, estate. 
</p>
<p>The letters are primarily between William Cobbs and William R. Cox and concern Cox's management of his finances and primarily concern William Cobbs' affairs as an enslaver. The correspondence highlight white enslaver's treatment of enslaved Black individuals as chattel. Many of the letters concern the most advantageous hiring out agreements for Harry, George and Peter, three Black men enslaved by Cobbs. Additionally, there are mentions of Harry's poor mental health, the self-emancipation of Ned and Tom and their pursuit to flee to Ohio or Canada, death of Moses, and sale of Stephen. </p>
