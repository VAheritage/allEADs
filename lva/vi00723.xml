      <p>John Tyler was born 29 March 1790 in Charles City County,
         Virginia to John Tyler (1747-1813) and Mary Marot Armistead
         Tyler (1761-1797). He attended private schools and graduated
         from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg,
         Virginia, in 1807. Tyler studied law, was admitted to the bar
         in 1809 and began practicing in Charles City County. Tyler
         represented Charles City County in the House of Delegates from
         1811 to 1816. He was appointed a member of the council of
         state in 1816, and was elected as a Republican to Congress,
         serving from 1817 to 1821. After declining reelection because
         of poor health, Tyler returned to the House of Delegates from
         1823 until elected governor of Virginia in 1825. When his term
         ended in 1827, Tyler was elected to the United States Senate
         in 1827 and served until resigning in 1836. While Senator,
         Tyler served as a member of the State constitutional
         convention of 1829-1830. After leaving the U.S. Senate, Tyler
         again returned to the House of Delegates. In 1840, he was
         elected Vice President of the United States and succeeded to
         the presidency upon the death of William Henry Harrison
         (1773-1841) in 1841. Tyler finished his term in 1845 and
         returned to Virginia. When the Civil War was iminent, Tyler
         served as a delegate to and president of the peace convention
         held in Washington, D.C., in 1861 in an effort to devise means
         to prevent the impending war. He was elected to the
         Confederate Provisional Congress in 1861 and to the House of
         Representatives of the Confederate Congress. Tyler married
         first, Letitia Christian (1790-1842) of New Kent County,
         Virginia, and they had eight children. He married second Julia
         Gardiner (1820-1889) of New York, and they had seven children.
         Tyler died in Richmond, Virginia, 18 January 1862, and was
         interred in Hollywood Cemetery.</p>
