<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This Will Book, 1794-1833, records loose wills. The book is divided into 3 sections. The first section, pages 1-110, covers wills originally recorded in a will book which was lost or destroyed. The second section, pages 111-121, covers wills originally recorded in Deed Book 1. The third section, pages 122-131, covers wills that had never been recorded. The majority of wills, in all three sections , are arranged by the date that they were written instead of a probate date. There are, however, the following exceptions(wills with a probate date): Nathaniel Ewing, pp. 34-37, 1831; William Graham, pp. 91-93, 1830; Thomas Hardy, pp. 102-
105, 1832; Jeremiah Munsey, pp. 106-107, 1833; Margaret Razor, pp. 108-110, 1833 and Walter Middleton, pp. 113-114, 1795. There is an alphabetical index of all wills at the front of the volume.
