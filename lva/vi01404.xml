      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Lee County was formed from Russell County in 1792. Part of Scott County was added in 1823.  It was named for Henry "Light-Horse Harry" Lee, governor of Virginia from 1791 to 1794.
</p>
      <p>Individuals dying with a written will died testate. After the death of an individual, his or her will was brought into court, where two of the subscribing witnesses swore that the document was genuine. After the will was proved, the executor was bonded to carry out his or her duties to settle the estate. The court then ordered the will to be recorded.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Lee County (Va.) Loose will book, 1794-1833, records the deceased's plan for how his or her estate was to be divided among his or her heirs following his or her death. Information commonly recorded in wills include the name of the deceased, also referred to as the testator; names of heirs; a listing of real and personal property (including slaves) and how it was to be divided among the heirs; names of individuals who were to be the will's executors; the date will was written; and the date will was recorded at the court house.
</p>
      <p>In addition, Lee County (Va.) Loose will book, 1794-1833, records loose wills. The book is divided into 3 sections. The first section, pages 1-110, covers wills originally recorded in a will book which was lost or destroyed. The second section, pages 111-121, covers wills originally recorded in Deed Book 1. The third section, pages 122-131, covers wills that had never been recorded. The majority of wills, in all three sections, are arranged by the date that they were written instead of a probate date. There are, however, the following exceptions(wills with a probate date): Nathaniel Ewing, pp. 34-37, 1831; William Graham, pp. 91-93, 1830; Thomas Hardy, pp. 102- 105, 1832; Jeremiah Munsey, pp. 106-107, 1833; Margaret Razor, pp. 108-110, 1833 and Walter Middleton, pp. 113-114, 1795. There is an alphabetical index of all wills at the front of the volume. Microfilm Reel 13 consists of abstracts of wills found in Deed Book 1.
