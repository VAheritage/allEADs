      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Born 28 July 1831, Henry Thweatt Owen entered the
         Confederate Army as a Captain of Company C, 18th Virginia
         Infantry Regiment on 23 April 1861 in Burkeville, Virginia. He
         was arrested on 5 June 1861, but by order of court martial was
         restored to command on 1 July 1861. He was again placed under
         arrest, this time for disobeying orders in regard to some sick
         men in his company, on 11 September 1861, by order of Colonel
         R. E. Withers, his commanding officer, and was cashiered on 22
         November 1861. However, his order of cashier was vacated, and
         he was elected Captain by his company on 26 April 1862. He was
         reported absent from the lines in Chesterfield County,
         Virginia, on 28 December 1864, by reason of his being under
         arrest and imprisoned in Castle Thunder. The reasons for
         Owen's frequent arrests remain a mystery, except for the
         arrest of 11 September 1861, and even in this case the matter
         is only partially explained in a letter of 29 March 1902 from
         Owen to Colonel R. E. Withers. Owen's war letters mention his
         arrests, but give no reasons.</p>
      <p>Following the war, he served as a clerk in the Second
         Auditor's Office in Richmond and devoted his spare time to
         investigating the Land Office records for genealogical
         information, and compiled preliminary maps showing plats of
         land grants in Prince Edward County. His wife was named
         Harriet, who bore him twelve children: Elizabeth Mildred
         (1852-1867), Henry Clay (1853-1883), Michael Melancthon
         (1856-1949), Harriet Louisa (b. 1860), Jacqueline Rosa (b.
         1865), William Temple (1867-1879), Herman S. (b. 1868),
         Benjamin Hilton (1868-1896), Sallie Marshall (b. 1871), Helen
         Mercer (b. 1873), Mary Eliza (Mamie) (b. 1875), and Charles
         Archer (1877-1879). Owen died in Richmond on 8 October
         1921.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Papers, 1822-1929, including a will (29 April 1822) and
         estate inventory (28 November 1825) of Ann Owen of Prince
         Edward County, letters, land records, military papers, lists
         of casualties and units at Gettysburg, a diary kept during the
         Civil War from 10 February to 10 July 1863, reminiscences of
         service during the Civil War, drafts of articles concerning
         the Civil War, poetry, a newspaper (Charlottesville Gazette,
         15 May 1884), photographs of Henry Thweatt Owen, the papers of
         James Whiteside, maps, broadsides, and lists of coupons issued
         under Acts of 1871, 1879, and 1892 and paid into the Second
         Auditor's Office.</p>
      <p>The letters, 1856-1924, comprise the bulk of the collection
         and concern Owen's military service, his desire for historical
         accuracy regarding the role of Pickett's Division in the
         Gettysburg campaign, postwar Virginia politics, and his career
         in the Second Auditor's Office. Correspondents includes James
         Lawson Kemper, James Longstreet, Philip W. McKinney, William
         Mahone, Charles Marshall, Roger A. Pryor, and Frank G.
         Ruffin.</p>
      <p>The military papers, 6 November 1862 - 8 August 1864,
         include letters, orders, and receipts of a military nature,
         especially concerning Union prisoners assembled for exchange
         at City Point. Lists of casualties and units at Gettysburg,
         n.d., include estimates of Union strength, company rosters,
         and lists of officers killed and wounded in Pickett's Charge.
         Diary, 10 February - 10 July 1863, traces the movements of the
         18th Virginia Infantry Regiment from Petersburg through the
         retreat from Gettysburg.</p>
      <p>Reminiscences are of Owen's service during the Civil War,
         Pickett's division, the Battle of South Mountain, and
         Pickett's Charge. James Whiteside papers, 1863-1893, include a
         discharge from the 46th Pennsylvania Militia Regiment, survey
         and plat of land in Charlotte County, receipts, and
         accounts.</p>
      <p>The maps include a railroad map of the United States with
         an emphasis on distances between San Francisco and Richmond
         (before 1889); a plat of Old Point Comfort (1891); plats,
         surveys, and notes concerning early settlers in Prince Edward
         County (ca. 1728 - ca. 1783, n.d.); plats and maps of property
         in and near the town of Virso, Prince Edward and Lunenburg
         Counties (ca. 1920 - ca. 1924); and a map of the first day of
         the Battle of Gettysburg (1876). These maps are located in Map
         cabinet 22, drawer 1. The broadsides consist of: "To the
         Survivors of Pickett's Division," 15 December 1887, and
         "Garnett's Brigade," n.d. The lists of coupons issued under
         Acts of 1871, 1879, 1892 and paid into the Second Auditor's
         Office are printed forms, filled in. The broadside and lists
         of coupon are located in Map cabinet 22, drawer 1.</p>
