      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Robert Brooke was born in Spotsylvania County to Richard
         Brooke and Ann Hay Taliaferro Brooke around 1760. Educated in
         Edinburgh, Scotland, during the Revolutionary War, Brooke
         returned to Virginia in 1780 where he enlisted in a volunteer
         cavalry troop and was captured by the British at Westham in
         January 1781. Brooke returned to Spotsylvania County to
         practice law, later moving his office to Fredericksburg. In
         1786, Brooke married Mary Ritchie Hopper (d. 1796) and settled
         on an estate in Fredericksburg which became known as Federal
         Hill. Brooke represented Spotsylvania County in the House of
         Delegates from 1791 until 1794. Upon the vacancy of the office
         of governor by Henry Lee to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion,
         the General Assembly elected Brooke governor on 20 November
         1794. He was reelected for a second one-year term on 26
         November 1795. Brooke County, now in West Virginia, was named
         after Robert Brooke when it was formed from part of Ohio
         County in 1796. Following his second term as governor, Brooke
         was elected to replace James Innes as attorney general of
         Virginia on 16 November 1796. He served as attorney general
         until his death on 27 February 1800.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Robert Brooke's Executive papers are organized
         chronologically with undated items arranged at the end of each
         year. These papers primarily consist of incoming
         correspondence during Brooke's two one-year terms as governor
         between 1 December 1794 until 1 December 1796. These records
         include correspondence written to James Wood who acted as
         Lieutenant Governor while Brooke was temporarily absent from
         office. The correspondence in this collection relates to a
         variety of topics including appointments for state positions;
         the Point of Fork Arsenal; defense of the frontier;
         resignations; arms &amp; ammunition; Indian attacks; British
         &amp; French ships in Virginia ports; the boundary line
         between Kentucky &amp; Virginia; extraditions; the Houdon
         statue of Washington; state expenses &amp; revenue; quarantine
         of vessels; foreign affairs; Revolutionary claims; elections;
         Presidential electors; the Capitol Building; the militia; and
         others. In addition to correspondence, there are resolutions
         from Congress and the Virginia Senate &amp; House of
         Delegates; muster &amp; pay rolls; accounts; oaths; pardons;
         receipts; election returns &amp; certificates; qualifications;
         lists; depositions; proclamations; petitions; reports;
         appointments; resignations; treaties; bonds; commissions;
         orders; proceedings; applications; lists; opinions; and other
         sundry items. Note that files related to county officers for
         1795 have been arranged alphabetically by county and separated
         to the end of the papers for that year.</p>
      <p>Noteworthy correspondence originates from the United States
         government, Virginia State government, and miscellaneous
         sources. Prominent correspondents from the United States
         government include Henry Knox, Timothy Pickering, &amp; James
         McHenry, Secretaries of War; Edmund Randolph &amp; Timothy
         Pickering, Secretaries of State; Alexander Campbell, U.S.
         District Attorney General, Samuel A. Otis &amp; John
         Beckley, Clerks of the Senate &amp; House of
         Representatives, and President George Washington.</p>
      <p>Governor Brooke received correspondence on numerous
         occasions from the United States War Department. On 5 December
         1794, Henry Knox transmitted a resolution by John Beckley,
         Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives, thanking the
         Virginia Militia for their service during the Whiskey
         Rebellion. Timothy Pickering replaced Knox as Secretary of War
         in 1795. Pickering writes on 6 January 1795 regarding the
         French ship Les Jumeaux which was armed and equipped at
         Philadelphia in violation of the U.S. neutrality law.
         Pickering also writes respecting bounty lands on the northwest
         side of the Ohio River for officers &amp; soldiers of the
         Virginia Line on Continental Establishment (1795 June 13). In
         addition, Pickering responds to a letter from the Governor
         concerning establishing a small garrison of militia at
         Norfolk. According to Pickering, the President has no
         authority to call out the militia for the preservation of
         peace (1795 July 3). Lastly, Pickering writes regarding the
         pay of Charles Cist for printing regulations for the order and
         discipline of U.S. troops (1795 Sept. 14). James McHenry
         replaced Pickering as Secretary of War in 1796. In a letter
         dated 4 March 1796, McHenry acknowledges the receipt of the
         Governor's letter, along with the account &amp; vouchers for
         militia &amp; scouts on the Western frontier. William Simmons,
         in the Dept. of War Accountant's Office, corresponds with the
         Governor concerning the compensation by the United States to
         Virginia for the pay &amp; subsistence of the militia,
         ammunition, and contingent expenses in the protection of the
         frontiers (1795 Sept. 17). On 14 March 1796, Simmons encloses
         a statement of differences on examination of the Virginia
         claims for pay, etc., in 1795. A letter from President George Washington dated 1796 Sept. 15 asks that his shares in the James River Company be applied to Liberty Hall Academy in rockbridge County (letter removed to the Vault - George Washington Papers).</p>
      <p>Edmund Randolph, former Governor of Virginia, corresponds
         as Secretary of State. On 3 January 1795, Randolph transmits a
         proclamation of thanksgiving from the President (proclamation
         not included). In another letter of the same date, Randolph
         remarks on a letter from the Governor regarding the embargo.
         On 16 February 1795, Randolph writes about the capture of a
         pilot boat belonging to the British Consul at Norfolk.
         Randolph encloses copies of letters from Gen. Thomas Mathews
         to Governor Lee, Alexander Hamilton, Sec. of the Treasury, and
         orders from Mathews to Lt. Vaughan. On 8 May 1795, Randolph
         encloses letters and papers from George Hammond, British
         Minister Plenipotentiary, concerning French prizes taken by
         Rear Admiral Murray and an order for foreign ships to depart
         American ports. Included is a copy of a letter from Thomas
         Jefferson to Hammond regarding French &amp; British ships in
         American ports and the treaty with France to admit prizes
         &amp; repair French ships in U.S. ports. The next day,
         Randolph encloses additional copies of letters from Hammond,
         along with a declaration &amp; affidavit by Thomas Butler
         regarding the French prizes taken by Admiral Murray. Finally,
         Randolph discusses the practice of British ships of war
         impressing American seamen (1795 May 20). All copies of
         letters were transcribed by George Taylor, Jr., Chief Clerk of
         the Department of State. Timothy Pickering served as Secretary
         of State upon the resignation of Randolph on 19 August 1795.
         On 20 January 1796, Pickering writes to Pierre A. Adet, French
         Minister Plenipotentiary, with respect to U.S. neutrality.
         Pickering also encloses a translation of a letter he received
         from Adet regarding the purchase of flour &amp; horses by the
         English in Virginia.</p>
      <p>Alexander Campbell, District U.S. Attorney, provides his
         opinion on the following subjects: the unlawful detention of a
         mariner by a British vessel of war (1795 Jan. 25), the
         delivery of a fugitive of justice from Pennsylvania and
         deserters from a British ship of war at Norfolk (1795 Jan.
         25), and the Unicorn, a suspected privateer outfitting at
         Gloucester (1795 June 26). In addition, Samuel A. Otis &amp;
         John Beckley periodically transmit journals of the proceedings
         of the U.S. Senate &amp; House of Representatives (1795 April
         13 &amp; 25, &amp; 1796 July 28).</p>
      <p>Significant correspondents from Virginia State government
         include Archibald Blair, Clerk of the Council; Samuel Coleman,
         Assistant Clerk of the Council of State; James Innes, Attorney
         General; Charles Hay, Clerk of the House of Delegates;
         Humphrey Brooke, Clerk of the Senate; William Hay, Robert
         Goode, &amp; William Foushee, etc., Directors of Public
         Buildings; Robert Quarles, Superintendent of the Point of Fork
         Arsenal; Thomas Newton &amp; Willis Wilson, County
         Lieutenants; John Pendleton, Jr., Auditor of Public Accounts;
         and Jacquelin Ambler, Treasurer.</p>
      <p>Archibald Blair &amp; Samuel Coleman, as Clerk &amp;
         Assistant Clerk of the Council, communicate with the Governor
         frequently through the Council Office. Blair offers the advice
         of the Council regarding the account against the U.S. for the
         Western defense, reimbursement for the Springfield expedition,
         the printing of German military regulations, and orders for
         scouts in Ohio &amp; Harrison Counties (1795 Jan. 14). Blair
         also writes G. Deneale denying his request to keep arms given
         to the light infantry under his command at Winchester to use
         against the insurgents (1795 Feb. 11). On 14 July 1795, Blair
         submits the order of the Council for ordering out the militia
         from Norfolk &amp; Portsmouth to prevent disorder or
         insurrections from the frequent migrations of negroes. Lastly,
         Blair provides the advice of the Council concerning witnesses
         against Archer Branch in North Carolina (1796 Feb. 15).
         Coleman mainly writes concerning military finances including
         the account of Hugh Caperton for ammunition (1794 Dec. 2) and
         Capt. William Lowther's pay abstract &amp; muster roll (1795
         March 5). On 12 May 1795, Coleman writes the Governor
         requesting that the office of Keeper of the Capitol not be
         taken from his father, Wyatt Coleman. His father writes a
         similar letter on the same date. On 4 December 1795, Coleman
         requests additional compensation for completing a list of
         officers &amp; privates of the Continental Line. Shortly
         thereafter, Coleman was appointed Adjutant General and asks
         the Lieutenant Governor for an apartment in the Capitol to
         perform his new duties (1795 Dec. 14).</p>
      <p>During James Innes' absence in 1794 &amp; 1795, John
         Marshall provides his opinion on the militia law as Attorney
         General of Virginia (1794 Undated). Upon Innes' return,
         Marshall writes as counsel to Lord Fairfax concerning the case
         of the Commonwealth against him in the Court of Appeals (1795
         March 2). On 23 April 1795, Innes writes that he will be
         unable to attend this trial in the Court of Appeals due to
         illness. Innes provides an opinion on such topics as the
         improper trial of William John Thweatt who was found guilty of
         horse stealing (1795 April 7), proceedings against Mr. Johnson
         for the alleged murder of Mr. Jeffers (1796 Jan. 13), and the
         power of the Governor to procure the attendance of necessary
         witnesses from the Territory South of the Ohio River (1796
         Feb. 3). On 21 June 1796, he remarks on the assignment of the
         Solicitor's Office for the use of the Attorney General. Again,
         on 17 July 1796, Innes writes that he must be absent from
         office because of health problems. He adds that he has asked
         Mr. Warden to discharge the duties of his office. Innes was
         forced to resign in a letter to the Governor dated 13 November
         1796.</p>
      <p>Charles Hay, Clerk of the House of Delegates, and Humphrey
         Brooke, Clerk of the Senate, often submit legislation and
         qualifications of election to the Governor. Noteworthy
         legislation includes a resolution to inquire about the
         "lucrative office" accepted by James Innes in the General
         Government (1794 Dec. 16). Included in these papers are the
         qualifications for the election of Spencer Roane as Judge of
         the Court of Appeals in place of Henry Tazewell (1794 Dec. 2),
         the election of Jaquelin Ambler as Treasurer (1794 Dec. 17),
         Paul Carrington as Judge of the General Court in place of
         Spencer Roane (1794 Dec. 17), Robert Brooke as Governor (1795
         Nov. 26), Robert Brooke as Attorney General (1796 Nov. 16),
         and Samuel Shepard as Auditor of Public Accounts in place of
         John Pendleton (1796 Nov. 16). A letter from John Wise,
         Speaker of the House of Delegates, encloses sundry resolutions
         for proposing certain amendments to the U.S. Constitution
         (1795 Dec. 19).</p>
      <p>William Hay, Robert Goode, &amp; William Foushee, etc.,
         Directors of Public Buildings, provide information on work
         done to the Capitol Building and the settlement of accounts.
         On 28 November 1795, William Hay writes regarding the account
         of Samuel Dobie for superintending &amp; directing the
         execution of the steps outside the Capitol, as well as the
         staircase, conference, and other work done inside the Capitol
         from 1793 to 1794. Hay also encloses accounts and a letter
         from Dobie indicating the amount of balances due him. On 30
         March 1796, the Directors write regarding the repair of the
         roof of the Capitol and surplus materials.</p>
      <p>Maj. Robert Quarles submits quarterly returns of ordnance
         &amp; public stores at Point of Fork (1795 Jan. 2, 1795 March
         31, 1795 June 30, 1795 Oct. 6, 1795 Dec. 31, 1796 March 31,
         1796 June 30, &amp; 1796 Sept. 30). In addition, Quarles'
         correspondence concerns a contract for provisions at Point of
         Fork (1795 May 5 &amp; 25), an increase in salary (1795 Oct.
         6), the bond of William Weaver to provide rations for the
         State Arsenal (1796 May 27), the supply of timber &amp;
         firewood contract with David Ross (1796 Sept. 12), and the

      <p>Thomas Newton, Jr., County Lieutenant for Norfolk Borough,
         frequently writes the Governor on a variety of concerns. On 11
         January 1795, Newton encloses copies of letters from the
         British &amp; French Consuls regarding disturbances between
         British &amp; French crews in Norfolk Harbor. On 14 January,
         Newton discusses the case of Daniel Raybourn, an American
         seamen taken by the Lynx, a British ship of war, from a Danish
         Brig. He encloses the opinion of Alexander Campbell to the
         Lieutenant Governor on the same matter on 25 January 1795. In
         another letter, he remarks on Campbell's opinion on British
         deserters and the extradition of the fugitive Joseph Larelle
         back to Pennsylvania (1795 Feb. 1). Newton communicates
         Campbell's opinion to John Hamilton, British Consul, stating
         that it is the duty of the magistrates to apprehend deserters
         (1795 Feb. 2). An incident occurred in February 1795 when a
         group of armed men from the British ship Thetis marched into
         Norfolk committing illegal searches in the homes of citizens
         for deserters. Newton informs the Governor of this incident
         and encloses an account by the Captain of the Watch, a copy of
         a letter from John Hamilton, and depositions (1795 Feb. 17).
         He writes again on this matter on 25 February 1795 enclosing
         letters from Alexander F. Cochrane, Captain of the Thetis,
         &amp; John Hamilton. Much of Newton's correspondence with
         Governor Brooke relates to the spread of diseases to Norfolk
         &amp; the quarantine of vessels (1795 April 28; 1795 May 5,
         16, 26; 1795 Aug. 22; 1795 Oct. 3; 1795 Nov. 4, 5, &amp; 17;
         1796 May 15 &amp; 29; 1796 July 8; 1796 Aug. 13 &amp; 28; 1796
         Sept. 12 &amp; 28; 1796 Oct. 27; &amp; 1796 Nov. 7). On 28
         February 1796, Newton writes regarding the purchase of two
         acres of land for building houses for the reception of goods
         and for accommodating the persons performing quarantine. On 17
         April 1795, Newton informs the Governor of American citizens
         detained on board Admiral Murray's ship the Resolution, a
         British ship of war. His letters of 1796 Feb. 7 &amp; 9 relate
         to letters from Henry McGeary, an American citizen impressed
         on the Resolution. Later, Newton encloses a letter from Judge
         Cyrus Griffin respecting the case of McGeary (1796 Feb. 21).
         Newton remarks on the arrival of three French ships from
         Guadalupe and the defenseless condition of the port due to the
         incompletion of the forts and the insufficient garrison there
         (1795 May 24). On 9 June 1795, Newton relates the capture of
         two French ships off the coast by the British ships Thetis
         &amp; Hussar. In addition, he mentions the arrival of a French
         ship from Dominique with French citizens and a number of
         negroes which they claim as servants. A few days later, Newton
         informs the Governor of the arrival of the Sloop Industry from
         Boston which carried negro slaves on board in violation of the
         non-importation laws (1795 June 11). In a letter dated 21 June
         1795, Newton encloses the deposition of Francis Marshal
         concerning two brigs taken off the coast of Virginia by a
         Bermudian privateer. Another significant event occurred in
         January 1796 when horses were purchased by British officers in
         the United States for mounting their troops against the French
         in the West Indies. Newton writes the Governor that this is a
         violation of the treaty with France &amp; Holland (1796 Jan.
         20). Shortly thereafter, he encloses a letter from Mr. Oster,
         French Consul, complaining of the shipment of horses by the
         British (1796 Jan. 23). The next day, he encloses one from
         John Hamilton denying that the shipment of horses is a
         military preparation (1795 Jan. 24).</p>
      <p>Willis Wilson, County Lieutenant for Portsmouth,
         corresponds with the Governor regarding similar subjects as
         Thomas Newton. On 29 April 1795, Wilson suggests that a boat
         be armed at Hampton Roads for the purpose of preventing
         violators of U.S. neutrality and to liberate the men impressed
         on board Rear Admiral Murray's Squadron. He encloses the
         deposition of Capt. Hatten whose ship was boarded by the Lynx.
         A letter from Wilson to Admiral Murray relates to hostile
         expeditions by ships of any belligerent nation in Virginia
         waters. In this letter, he orders the ships to depart Virginia
         waters and to liberate any American citizens detained on board
         (1795 April 27). Wilson encloses a letter from John Hamilton
         informing him that the vessels Diana &amp; Thomas are waiting
         to embark with their cargo of horses. On 24 June 1795, Wilson
         writes about the small pox epidemic in Portsmouth and the
         impressment of John Underwood &amp; John Lloyd on board the
         British ship Lynx. Finally, Wilson writes the Governor
         regarding the formation of an artillery company in Portsmouth
         under the command of John Cowper (1796 Feb. 23 &amp; March
         27).</p>
      <p>Governor Randolph corresponds often with John Pendleton,
         Jr., Auditor of Public Accounts, and Jaquelin Ambler,
         Treasurer, regarding various financial matters. Pendleton
         regularly encloses lists of warrants issued by him through the
         Auditor's Office (1795 March 31, 1795 July 1, 1795 Nov. 5,
         1795 Dec. 31, 1796 July 1). Additionally, Pendleton writes
         regarding the suspicion of a fraudulent sale against Robert
         Craig, former sheriff of Washington County (1794 Dec. 18).
         Pendleton encloses the report of John Taylor and the opinion
         of John Marshall on the matter. Pendleton also writes to the
         Governor enclosing accounts of expenses of his office (1795
         May 10). On 14 May 1795, Pendleton provided a report on the
         final settlement of William Davies' accounts as Commissioner
         of Virginia for Claims Against the United States. Pendleton
         submits his letter of resignation on 5 August 1796 effective
         at the end of the month. The next day, Pendleton recommends
         Samuel Shepard to replace him as Auditor. Pendleton's official
         letter of resignation was submitted on 30 Sept. 1796. Ambler
         encloses a statement of monies belonging to claimants for the
         defense of the Western frontier (1795 Aug. 27). In addition,
         on 24 September 1795, he encloses a copy of a letter from
         Samuel Meredith, U.S. Treasurer, regarding a warrant from the
         Secretary of War for the full balance due the State of
         Virginia for the settlement of their account for the pay &amp;
         subsistence of militia, scouts, ammunition, and contingent
         expenses in the protection of the frontiers.</p>
      <p>Notable correspondents from miscellaneous sources include
         the following: Andrew Dunscomb, Mayor of Richmond; John
         Hamilton, British Consul at Norfolk; and Thomas Mifflin,
         Governor of Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>Andrew Dunscomb mainly writes the Governor regarding the
         prevention of infectious disease to the City of Richmond. On
         27 August 1795, he encloses resolutions of the Common Hall
         relative to the quarantine of vessels from Norfolk.
         Additionally, he discusses a law prohibiting the migration of
         free negroes from the West Indies into the Commonwealth (1795
         Sept. 18). Dunscomb also transmits a letter from William
         Richardson &amp; Jacob I. Cohen regarding allowing passage of
         vessels from Norfolk, but stopping vessels from New York (1795
         Oct. 6).</p>
      <p>John Hamilton, British Consul, frequently writes the
         Governor regarding British affairs. On 2 January 1795,
         Hamilton requests permission for the British ships Thetis
         &amp; Cleopatra to make repairs in Norfolk Harbor. Hamilton
         also writes at length regarding British desertions,
         particularly the incident involving the attempt by British
         sailors on board the Thetis to recapture deserters in Norfolk
         (1795 Feb. 18, 25, &amp; May 8). Hamilton was also
         particularly concerned with privateers preying on British
         ships. He specifically mentions a ship called the Unicorn
         which plundered a Danish vessel (1795 June 26 &amp; July 30).
         In addition, Hamilton communicates his intelligence regarding
         vessels from Baltimore arming in the Chesapeake as privateers
         (1795 Aug. 15 &amp; Sept. 24). His letter to the Lieutenant
         Governor relates to the prevention of illegal equipment for
         ships in the waters of Virginia (1795 July 3 &amp; Oct. 6).
         Yet another incident occurred in January 1796 when the
         American Sloop Diana, loaded with British goods and bound for
         a British port in the West Indies, was forcibly boarded and
         her cargo carried away. Hamilton sends a letter to the
         Governor complaining about this incident, along with a similar
         letter to Willis Wilson (1796 Jan. 29). Finally, on 15
         February 1796, Hamilton writes regarding his inquiry to the
         President on the shipment of horses and the neutrality
         laws.</p>
      <p>As Governor of Pennsylvania, Thomas Mifflin often
         corresponds with Governor Brooke with respect to fugitives
         from justice. On 29 December 1794, Mifflin transmits the
         affidavit of Stephen Girard affirming that Joseph Larelle had
         taken a mulatto boy named Crispin from his service with an
         intention of selling him into slavery. He writes again on 10
         February 1795 concerning the apprehension of Larelle. In a
         letter dated 12 March 1795, Mifflin informs the Governor of
         the appointment of Laurence Maher as Agent for Pennsylvania to
         bring Joseph Larelle back to Pennsylvania. Similarly, Mifflin
         transmits a copy of an affidavit by Robert Ross respecting
         Langford Herring who was accused of forgery and removed to
         Virginia (1795 Oct. 12). Mifflin also acknowledges the receipt
         of the revised laws from Virginia (1795 May 14 &amp; 1796 Aug.
         25) and a resolution from Virginia proposing certain
         amendments to the U.S. Constitution (1796 Jan. 6). Mifflin
         responds to another letter on 22 January 1796 regarding an
         annual interchange of the laws passed by Pennsylvania &amp;
         Virginia.</p>
