<p>In October 1782 the General Assembly passed an act authorizing soldiers and officers of the Virginia lines on continental and state establishments to receive interest on certificates issued for pay. As a further relief, the certificates were authorized to be receivable for taxes. The sheriff who collected the taxes endorsed the back of the certificate and gave a receipt to the taxpayer. The certificate was then sent to the auditor of public accounts, who issued a warrant charging the tax to the soldier or officer and deducting the amount from the principal due him.</p>
