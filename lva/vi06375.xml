      <head>Historical Information
</head>
	<p>Although the colonial government had appointed auditors general from time to time, the office was not established on a permanent basis until after independence was declared. At its first session, which convened on 7 October 1776, the General Assembly passed an act creating a board of three auditors to examine and settle claims concerning receipts and expenditures for military purposes. The confusing financial situation of the state, however, resulted in a series of acts being passed over the next fifteen years elaborating and refining the duties of the auditors. Finally, at its session begun in November 1791, the General Assembly passed an act that combined the duties of the board of auditors and the solicitor general, whose office had been created in 1785 to settle the accounts of the state with the United States, and assigned them to a single auditor of public accounts effective 1 January 1792. The auditor soon became the most powerful fiscal officer in the state. All receipts and disbursements were made only upon his warrant to the treasurer, and his books were the standard against which those of the treasurer were checked.</p>

<p>The first changes were made as the accounts of the revolutionary era were settled. As the state moved into a period of steady financial and governmental growth in the nineteenth century, the number of accounts and funds maintained by the auditor became excessive. Thus, on 24 February 1823 the General Assembly passed an act creating the office of the second auditor to ease the auditor's burden. Although the second auditor handled several large special funds, the auditor continued to be responsible for most of the accounts concerning the daily operation of state government.</p>

<p>The records of the first auditor of public accounts have not survived intact; periodically they have been subjected to disarrangement or destruction. When the auditor's office was created in 1776, Virginia's seat of government was in Williamsburg. In 1780, when the capital was moved to Richmond, the auditors and their records also moved. At this time, and during Benedict Arnold's raid on Richmond in 1781, some auditor's records were misplaced or destroyed. During the War of 1812, when it was believed that British troops were marching on Richmond, the state's records were loaded onto wagons and hauled to the James River for transportation upstream. Before the boats sailed, however, the alarm proved false and the records were unloaded and returned to the State Capitol.</p>

<p>Effective 1 March 1928 the office of auditor of public accounts and second auditor were abolished and replaced by the office of comptroller--head of the Department of Accounts--to monitor the receipt and disbursement of state funds, and a new office of auditor of public accounts, under the General Assembly, to audit state and local government agencies.</p>

In order to encourage enlistments, loan office certificates for one thousand pounds of inspected tobacco were sent to the commanding officers of the militia who issued them to recruits as bounties at the end of their enlitments. The officers returned to the auditors of public accounts the names of recruits to whom certificates were issued, as well as any unused certificates. Certificates are very fragile.</p>

<p>The General Assembly, during its May 1781 session, passed an act authorizing the militia when in actual service to receive the same pay as officers and soldiers in the Continental Army.

During its October 1787 session the General Assembly instructed the auditor of public accounts to stop issuing militia certificates.

<p>In October 1782 the General Assembly passed an act authorizing soldiers and officers of the Virginia lines on continental and state establishments to receive interest on certificates issued for pay. As a further relief, the certificates were authorized to be receivable for taxes. The sheriff who collected the taxes endorsed the back of the certificate and gave a receipt to the taxpayer. The certificate was then sent to the auditor of public accounts, who issued a warrant charging the tax to the soldier or officer and deducting the amount from the principal due him.</p>
