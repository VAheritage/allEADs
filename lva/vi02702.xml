<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Henry Horatio Wells was born in September 1823 in Rochester, New York.  He completed his education in Detroit, Michigan and began practicing law, defending several white men who had assisted slaves fleeing to Canada.  In the mid-1840s he married Millicent Leib, the daughter of a Michigan judge, and by 1860 he had several children, including one son named after him.  In 1854, Wells was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives where he supported free schools and emancipation.  In 1862 he assisted in recruiting a regiment, the 26th Michigan Infantry, and became its lieutenant colonel in October of that year.  When the unit was sent to Virginia, Wells was the provost marshal in Alexandria and later became the provost marshal of defenses south of the Potomac River.  In 1865, Wells played an important part in the capture of John Wilkes Booth.  
After the war, Wells brought his family to Alexandria and became friendly with John C. Underwood, a radical federal district judge.  Wells took part in leasing the Alexandria Canal and returned it to operation.  In December 1867, Underwood oversaw the state constitutional convention.  A group of Republicans petitioned General John M. Schofield, commander of Military District Number One, to name Wells as governor.  In March 1868 Schofield removed Governor Pierpont and appointed Wells.  The Republican convention on May 6, 1868 heartily endorsed Wells as their candidate in the upcoming elections.  Victory appeared certain with a weak Conservative candidate, Robert E. Withers from Lynchburg.  General Schofield disagreed with the disfranchisement and "test-oath" which would prohibit Confederate sympathizers from holding public office, and did not submit the Underwood Constitution for voting in June 1868 citing a state funding shortage.  Schofield became secretary of war for Andrew Johnson and was replaced by General George Stoneman.  Wells went to Washington to seek support for a Virginia election, but Congress was concerned with the presidential race.  Republicans did not want to upset their power by restoring Virginia to the Union only to gain Democrat votes.  
General Stoneman retained complete control over state officials and Wells had little authority.  Despite his limited powers, he appointed notaries, oversaw maintenance of the penitentiary, pardoned criminals, and sought to improve the state's finances.  Wells persuaded Stoneman to abolish the Virginia State Guard (also known as the Public Guard) which was created in 1801 to protect the capital from slave uprisings and protect the penitentiary.  Wells was a member of the Board of Public Works along with the state treasurer and state auditor.  He became involved in a conflict with William Mahone over control of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad.  Mahone wanted to incorporate the line with others under his direction to link Norfolk and Bristol.  Although first thought to support Mahone, Wells had been seeking out-of-state support against Mahone.  Mahone and his supporters created a "New Movement" which advocated "home rule" and opposed northern domination.  
Mahone supporters James B. Baldwin and Alexander H. H. Stuart led supporters to accept black enfranchisement in exchange for omitting the test-oath.  A committee went to Washington to assert that white Virginians were loyal to the Union and would adhere to Reconstruction legislation, including the Fourteenth Amendment.  In 1869 President Grant supported the New Movement.  Moderate Republicans began to undermine the radical organization by giving Wells a black running mate, Dr. J. D. Harris.  The moderates then convened in Petersburg as "True Republicans" and nominated Gilbert C. Walker, a Mahone supporter.  By the spring of 1869 the True Republicans had convinced Withers to withdraw from the race and garnered substantial white support against Wells.  In a public letter to Thomas Garland, Wells announced his support for the New Movement's separate votes on the test-oath and disfranchisement, which alienated his black and radical Republican supporters.  In April 1869, Stoneman abruptly removed Wells from office.  He was soon restored, and President Grant replaced Stoneman with General Edward R. S. Canby.  On Election Day, the Underwood Constitution passed easily while both the test-oath and disfranchisement were soundly defeated.  Wells lost to Walker by 18,000 votes. Wells charged Walker with corruption, but Canby's investigation showed fraud on both sides.  Wells' supporters approached the True Republicans offering to support Walker as governor in exchange for supporting Wells for the U.S. Senate.  General Canby ordered Wells to resign and appointed Walker provisional governor until the new state constitution was established.  This order took effect on September 21, 1869.
In 1870, the Grant administration appointed Wells U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.  In 1872 he resigned the office to his son and entered private practice in Washington.  He returned to the post from 1875 to 1880 for the District of Columbia but continued to practice law in the city.  He died in his daughter's home in Palmyra, New York on February 12, 1900.
