      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
      <p>Arlington County was originally named Alexandria County. It was formed from a portion of Fairfax County that Virginia in 1789 ceded to the federal government for use as the site of a new national capital. In 1801 the area officially became part of the District of Columbia, although Congress named it Alexandria County. By an act of 9 July 1846, Congress returned the county to Virginia, and the General Assembly extended the commonwealth's jurisdiction over the region effective 20 March 1847. By an act of assembly passed 16 March 1920, the county's name was changed to Arlington, the name of the Custis family mansion (the home of Robert E. Lee), which is located in the county.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Arlington County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1786-1899, are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
      <p>Chancery cases are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>Cause involves a dispute related to the purchase by Mason of glebe land in Fairfax Parish from the Protestant Episcopal Church of Alexandria, or as it became known in 1814, Christ Church. The source of contention between the plaintiff and the defendants was the question of whether Christ Church of Alexandria had jurisdiction within Fairfax Parish and therefore had the authority to sell the land. The plaintiff in his bill and amended bill and the defendants in their answer provided very detailed legal and historical arguments to support their claims. The defendants in their answer presented a history of how Christ Church acquired land in Fairfax Parish from the parish's inception in 1765. In the process of doing so, they discussed the nature of the relationship between the two churches in the parish, Falls Church and Christ Church; how the parish was governed; and the decline in membership of Falls Church. Plaintiff and defendants provided evidence to support their arguments such as a copy of a bill from a previous chancery case involving Christ Church, a copy of a Supreme Court mandate, a copy of a deed, and correspondence. The chancery cause also includes miscellaneous papers related to the case such as subpoenas, affidavits, and depositions.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>Bruin was leading slave trader in Alexandria, Virginia. One of his agents purchased an enslaved girl named Mary Catherine from a Frederick Vaccari. The agent and Bruin were told she was enslaved for life. After a brief stay in Bruin's slave jail, they sent her to Georgia along with other slaves to be sold. Plaintiffs claimed the enslaved girl should not have been sold out of the state because she was not enslaved for life. Mary Catharine was to be freed when she reached the age of 25. One of the previous owners of Mary Catharine named her after his two daughters, Mary and Catharine. The suit offers insight into domestic slave trade.

          <p>Sarah G. Johnson sues her former husband, Louis H. Crowe, for not paying for land she deeded over to him while they were married. Johnson asserts she was the legal owner of the land before the marriage and that after she deeded the land to Crowe, he physically drove her off the property. However, Crowe claimed that he was driven from the land and was forced to jump from a second story window, breaking his leg, to save himself from her violence. See also 1891-002-Sarah G. Crowe vs. Louis H. Crowe.
