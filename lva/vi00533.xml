        <p>This finding aid contains multiple accessions for the correspondence and subject files of the Librarian of Virginia and new accruals will be added to the finding aid as they are received.  Each new accession will begin in Box 1.  Original order has been maintained and inconsistencies exist in the filing in the separate accessions:  material may be filed by sender, recipient, institution or type of document; universities and university libraries are often filed by state, but may also be filed under the specific name of the institution.  Also note that documents by the same author or insitution can be found in multiple folder due to the subjective nature of the filing.  Memorandums written by the State Librarian may also be filed under "A" for administration.

      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>For many years, The Library of Virginia had no definitive home.  Valuable early records were kept at Jamestown as early as 1676 and were then moved to the College of William and Mary for a brief period at the century's end.  By 1780, extant records were moved to the Capitol in Richmond.
</p>
      <p>Coincidentally, in 1779, the Virginia General Assembly was presented among its legislation, "A Bill for Establishing a Public Library" drawn up by Thomas Jefferson.  The Bill provided for 2000 pounds yearly to be expended to maintain a State Library in Richmond. The facility was to be a reference library only without books being lent for home use.  Perhaps ahead of its time, the bill failed to pass.</p>
      <p>The Virginia State Library was created by an act passed by the General Assembly on January 23, 1823, to establish a public library with funds derived from the sale of William W. Hening's THE STATUTES AT LARGE.  From 1823 to 1828, the Library was under the control of the governor and council.  In 1828, the General Assembly created a joint committee on the library (located in a room in the southeastern corner of the Capitol) to oversee its administration.  Use of the State Library was restricted to members of the state government in a policy that continued until at least 1856.  The Secretary of the Commonwealth served ex officio as state librarian from 1832 to 1903.</p>
      <p>The growth of the State Library was somewhat erratic.  Book holdings increased from 1,313 in 1828 to 17,480 in 1856.  Lack of funds and politics frequently intermingled to slow library development.  General W. H. Richardson, State Librarian in 1852, became embroiled in an effort to remove him "to make way for some politician of democratic principles."  At the close of Reconstruction, Dr. George William Bagby, then State Librarian, was terminated and his position abolished at the hands of Readjusters.</p>
      <p>Eventually, on May 15, 1903, the General Assembly passed an act that created a library board to administer the library, authorized the deposit of public records in the library, provided for the publication of historical records by the library, and established a library fund for the purchase of books and private papers.  The Library Board, which was responsible for naming the State Librarian, was itself appointed by the Board of Education.  The General Assembly passed an act on March 29, 1944, transferring the power to appoint the Library Board to the governor.</p>
      <p>While many public records somehow survived the Commonswealth's early years, many losses occurred due to fires, the ravages of war and negligence.  When the library was moved, for example, in 1895 to a building separate from the Capitol, "chutes were constructed from the upper story of the Capitol to facilitate the delivery of books to the wagons of the junk dealer who had bought them."  The move was poorly planned and the library's contents suffered great loss at the hands of those very authorities assigned to protect them.</p>
      <p>The new facility quickly was found to be inadequate and efforts were made both in 1910 and 1920 to construct a proper building for the State Library and its collections. Ground was broken for a new facility on December 7, 1938. At last, on December 23, 1940, the newly completed Virginia State Library was opened to the public.</p>
      <p>The Virginia State Library adopted the name, the Virginia State Library and Archives, in early 1987 to more adequately reflect its mission and purpose. On July 1, 1994 the name was changed to The Library of Virginia, evocative of the Library of Congress.  In 1997 the library moved to, it's fourth and current location, the 800 block of East Broad Street.</p>
      <p>The title of State Librarian has been held by: John Pendleton Kennedy (1903-1906), Henry Read McIlwaine (1907-1934), Wilmer L. Hall (1935-1947), Randolph W. Church (1948-1970), Donald R. Haynes (1971-1984), Ella Gaines Yates (1985-1990), Dr. John C. Tyson (1991-1994), Nolan T. Yelich (1995-2007), the current State Librarian, Sandra Gioia Treadway, took office July 1, 2007.

            <p>This collection is comprised of reports, clippings,
         correspondence related to the State Library as well as
         materials related to the School Book Investigation which
         included an investigation into the acquisition of materials
         for the Travelling Library. This collection contains
         correspondence, reports and newsclippings related to the
         library and its activities. Included are a draft of an annual
         report, an inventory of the Archives Room (date unknown) as
         well as materials regarding some of the controversies that
         have surrounded the library. Included here are materials
         related to the loss of items in the collections (1912), the
         condition of the library building (1912), and the sale of
         collection materials (1895). It also contains
         correspondence, reports, newsclippings, and court transcripts
         relating to the School Book Investigation. The School Book
         Investigation focused on purchasing practices employed in the
         acquisition of textbooks and also books for the Travelling
         Library. Mr. J.P. Kennedy, State Librarian, was under
         investigation in this affair, and his correspondence with
         publishers is found in this series. Oversize materials may be
         found in Box 2.</p>

            <p>Accession 28771 consists of correspondence to and from the State Librarian, the majority of which deals with federal programs which were designed to create employment durring the Great Depression, such as, the Work Projects Administration, Emergency Relief Administration, and the Federal Civil Works Administration. These programs funded projects which enabled Virginia libraries to catalog, index, repair, survey collections and create mobile libraries, or bookmobiles.  Other files pertain to the conservation of food during World War One, the gift of John Stewart Bryan's private library (Bryan was the President of Richmond Newspaper, Inc.), the Commission on National Archives Survey, the International Congress of Archives, as well as, newspaper and microfilm holdings.  The State Librarians addressed in this collection are: H. R. McIllwaine, Wilmer L. Hall, and Randolph W. Church.

            <p>Box 1 contains the correspondence of State Librarian, Randolph W. Church in regard to the lamination of aging documents. Correspondents include by are not limited to; Library of Congress, National Archives and Records Administration, National Bureau of Standards, and William "Bill" Barrow head of the conservation laboratory at the state library.  The Virginia State Library, Library of Congress and National Bureau of Standards collaborated on developing a process to preserve aging documents by lamination.  The lamination process consisted of pressing documents between two thin layers of cellulose acetate, which also contains stabilizers, plasticizer and impurities.  This process was used on many documents at the state library as part of the Lamination Project.  1958-1959 contains many letters which discuss the debate as to the effectiveness and longevity of the lamination process, and by 1962 there were letters between Church and Barrow as to the cause of the odd acidic smell emitted by documents which had been laminated. Included are invoices, drafts, research reports, payment reciepts.</p>
            <p>Box 2 contains the correspondence of State Librarian, Randolph W. Church relating to the 350th anniversary of the Jamestown Settlement.  Correspondents include but are not limited to; Parke Rouse, Executive Director of the Virginia 350th Anniversary Commission, Francis L. Berkeley, Jr. curator of manuscripts at Alderman Library at the University of Virginia, George H. Reese, who aided in obtaining microfilm copies of colonial records held in British and French repositories, as well as, William J. Van Schreeven, chairman of the subcommittee on Colonial Records.  Included are reports, agendas, plans, and memorandums.

            <p>This collection contains the correspondence of State Librarian, Randolph W. Church, and Assistant Librarian, Ray O. Hummel. Correspondents include but are not limited to; state and federal agencies, universities, libraries, patrons, genealogical societies, Association of Southeastern Research Libraries, and the American Library Association. Topics discussed are the "Virginia Cavalcade," book assessments, the bookmobile program, subscriptions, Statistical surveys, cataloging, and copyright issues.  Included are invitations, letters, newsletters, memoranda, and receipts.
</p>
            <p>Among Church's correspondence for 1971 were memoranda, drafts and transcripts regarding Governor Linwood Holton's conference on Public Library Service at the Richmond Convention Center 4 Oct 1971. The conference was designed to serve as a review of library services throughout the state and across all age groups, in addition to devising a strategy for the efficient dissemination of knowledge into the future. A Keynote address was given by Virginius Dabney, and State Library Board chairman, Mrs. Virginius R. Shackelford, presided over the events.  Church was the mediator of a panel whose participants were made up of state librarians from New Jersey, North Carolina, and Ohio.  Also in 1971 United States Senator, Harry F. Byrd, wrote to Church asking for his help on behalf of fellow Senator B. Everett Jordan and Mr. John C. Stargel in conducting genealogical research.</p>
            <p>1972 saw the succession of Donald R. Haynes to the office of State Librarian, this same year the Virginia Library Association introduced their Reprint Project.  The reprint Project offered Virginia state libraries the chance to own seventeen popular titles related to state history which had been out-of-print for many years.  In 1973, George Bird Evans, sent the library three articles about, as well as, a photocopy of the original sheet music for the song "Dixie." Haynes solicited for the original to be gifted to the library, but the Evans family appears to have maintained possession.
