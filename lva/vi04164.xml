<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Ardath Jo Green was born on 24 June 1923 in Pennington Gap, Lee County, Virginia, the daughter of Etta Ellison Green (1886-1980) and John Wallace Green (1867-1937). On 19 August 1943, she enlisted with the Women's Reserve of the U.S. Navy. In 1948, she and a colleague were the first two women in the Fifth Naval District to be sworn in as members of the regular Navy, following the passage of the Women's Armed Service Integration Act in June of that year. Her 24-year military career included three tours at the Recruit Training Center in Bainbridge, Maryland (from which she retired as a Chief Disbursing Clerk in 1967). Among the many roles she took on over the course of her military service were Chief Master-at-arms, WAVE barracks, U.S. Naval Hospital, St. Albans, N.Y.; assisting in planning the WAVES barracks at Brooklyn, N.Y.; working in the Disbursing Office at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida; and serving as Company Commander for eight recruit companies (in her second tour at Bainbridge).
