</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph>
Business Records, both volumes and loose records are in some cases transferred to the Library of Virginia as components of court record transfers.  These business records in some cases were simply stored in the local court building for safekeeping by business owners.  In other cases, business records (particularly ledgers, account books, etc.) may have been filed in a court case as an exhibit.  These business records exhibit appeared both in chancery causes and in judgments.  These records serving as exhibits for business dissolution cases, debt suits, and contract disputes.
</p> 
<p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph>Richmond, located between Henrico and Chesterfield Counties, was named by William Byrd (1674-1744), who envisioned the development of a city at the falls of the James River and with the help of William Mayo laid out the town in 1737. The name probably came from the English borough of Richmond upon Thames, which Byrd visited on several occasions. Richmond was established in 1742 and in 1779 was designated the capital of Virginia effective 30 April 1780. It was incorporated as a town, although "stiled the city of Richmond," in 1782 and was incorporated as a city in 1842. It served as the capital of the Confederacy from mid-1861 to April 1865. Richmond was enlarged by the annexation of Manchester (or South Richmond) in 1910, and by the addition of Barton Heights, Fairmount, and Highland Park in 1914. Further annexations from Chesterfield County occurred in 1942 and 1970. </p>
<p><emph render="bold">Lost Records Note:</emph> During the burning of Richmond on April 3, 1865, during the Civil War, Richmond circuit court judge John A. Meredith led efforts to save the circuit court records found at the State Court House. Rescuers successfully removed all the papers that were necessary to pending suits and many of the order books, but all of the wills and deed books were lost. Records of the superior court and circuit superior court of law and chancery were also destroyed. Most of the pre-Civil War Hustings Court records exist.</p>

<p> <emph render="bold">Historical Information:</emph>The Commonwealth Bank operated in Richmond, Va., during the early twentieth century. The bank was known as the Realty Bond and Trust Company before changing its name in 1906. In August 1913 the State Corporation Commission of Virginia placed control of the bank in the hands of receivers after determining that the bank was not fully observing the banking laws of the state. Generally, receivers are a neutral person appointed by the court to receive and preserve the property in litigation and to apply or dispose issues and profits at the direction of the court. James W. Gordon and John B. Lightfoot, Jr. were placed in charge of the bank's affairs and assets and were authorized to oversee the dissolution of the bank. The business of closing the Commonwealth Bank concluded in 1917.
