         <p>The Board for Architects, Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, Certified Interior Designers and Landscape Architects promulgates regulations governing its own organization, the professional qualifications of applicants, the requirements necessary for passing examinations, the proper conduct of its examinations, the implementation of exemptions from license requirements, and the proper discharge of its duties. It also issues licenses to practice as a professional engineers, architect, land surveyor or certificates to practice as landscape architect or interior designer in the Commonwealth to applicants meeting specified requirements. The board was established in 1920 for architects, engineers and surveyors, but later added landscape architects in 1980 and certified interior designers in 1990. The Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation provides administrative support to the board.</p>
