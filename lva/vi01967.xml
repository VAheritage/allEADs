</head>
      <p>Joseph Johnson was born on 19 December 1785 in Orange County, New York.  The second son of Joseph and Abigail Johnson, Johnson relocated to Harrison County, Virginia, now West Virginia, in 1801.  He married Sarah (Sally) Smith, daughter of Ephraim Smith, on 16 May 1804.  Johnson served as captain of the Harrison Riflemen during the War of 1812.  Following the war, Johnson represented Harrison County in the House of Delegates for the sessions 1815-1816, 1818-1819, 1819-1820, and 1821-1822.  Elected to the Eighteenth &amp; Nineteenth Congresses, Johnson also served in the House of Representatives from 4 March 1823 to 3 March 1827.  Subsequent to an unsuccessful reelection to the Twentieth Congress, Johnson was elected to fill the vacancy in the Twenty-second Congress occasioned by the death of Philip Doddridge in 1832.  Johnson returned to Washington as a Jackson Democrat to serve in the Twenty-fourth, Twenty-fifth, Twenty-sixth, &amp; Twenty-ninth Congresses from 4 March 1835 to 3 March 1841 and 4 March 1845 to 3 March 1847.  At various times during his tenure in the House of Representatives, Johnson chaired several committees including the Committee on Expenditures on Public Buildings, the Committee on Accounts, and the Committee on Revolutionary Claims.  Following his federal service, Johnson again represented Harrison County in the House of Delegates for the session of 1847-1848.  In 1850, Johnson was elected as one of the delegates to the Convention of 1850-1851 which established universal white adult male suffrage and provided for the popular election of the governor.  During the Convention, Johnson acted as chairman of the essential Committee on Suffrage.  As a result of his work in the Convention of 1850-1851, Joseph Johnson became the first popularly elected governor of Virginia on 1 January 1852  defeating Whig candidate Judge George W. Summers.  Johnson served one four-year term and retired from public office.  Although opposed to secession, Johnson nevertheless supported Virginia &amp; the Confederacy during the Civil War.  He died in Bridgeport on 27 February 1877 and was buried in the Old Brick Church Cemetery.
