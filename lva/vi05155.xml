      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Dickenson County was named for William J. Dickenson, delegate to the General Assembly from Russell County in 1880 when Dickenson County was formed from Russell, Wise, and Buchanan Counties. The county seat is Clintwood.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Dickenson County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1883-1931, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.
</p>
      <p>The chancery causes are mostly comprised of debt suits, many of which ended between 1890 and 1910, and divorce suits, which primarily ended between 1890 and 1912. Frequently occurring topics of interest include property, women, and social conventions.
</p>
<p>Commonly found surnames among the plaintiffs and defendants include Anderson, Colley, Counts, Damron, Davis, Dotson, Fleming, Hall, Hawkins, Hill, Kiser, Mullins, Owens, Phipps, Powers, Rasnick, Rose, Smith, Stanley, Sutherland, Vanover, Viers, and Wright. Between 1905 and 1911, the Clinchfield Coal Company was the plaintiff in eight chancery causes and the primary defendant in three chancery causes.</p>
