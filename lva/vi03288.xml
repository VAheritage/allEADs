      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History: </emph>Accomack County was named for the Accomac Indians, who lived on the Eastern Shore at the time of the first English settlement in Virginia. The word means "on-the-other-side-of-water place" or "across the water." It was one of the original eight shires, or counties, first enumerated in 1634 and spelled Accomac without the k. The county's name was changed to Northampton County in 1643. The present county was formed from Northampton about 1663. In October 1670, the General Assembly temporarily reunited Accomack and Northampton Counties as Northampton County. In November 1673, Accomack County was again separated from Northampton. In early records, the county's name was spelled many ways. In 1940 the General Assembly adopted the present spelling, Accomack. The county gained a small part of the southern end of Smith's Island from Somerset County, Maryland, in 1879, after the United States had approved boundary changes between Virginia and Maryland that had been agreed to in 1877. The county seat is Accomac.
</p>
<p><emph render="bold">Lost Records Note:</emph> One of the original shires recognized in 1634, it became part of Northampton County in 1643, reverted to Accomack about 1663, merged into Northampton again in October 1670, and reverted to Accomack for the final time in November 1673. A significant number of loose records from the 1700s suffered extreme water and pest damage. Volumes that record deeds, court orders, and wills exist.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Accomack County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1727-1876 (bulk 1769-1876) consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.
</p>
      <p>Because the locality includes many of the islands located in the Chesapeake Bay, there are a fair amount of causes dealing with property on Chincoteague, Tangier, and various smaller islands. These causes in general detail life and business along the bay and Atlantic Ocean including maritime shipping, trade, and shipbuilding. Additionally, due to proximity to Delaware and Maryland, there are a number of causes that deal with disputes across these boards. 
</p>

<p>Chancery causes before 1870 contain a substantial amount of information concerning enslaved Black men, women, and children. While there are several suits concerning the freedom of enslaved individuals, these cases largely represent the perspective of white enslavers and their disputes involving the sale, hiring, financial responsibilities, and legality of ownership of Black individuals. </p>

<p>Chancery causes from the 1830s-1850s contain several instances of disputes concerning military land bounty warrants and various issues concerning property acquire as part of these bounties.  </p>

<p>There are a fair amount of cases, 1908-1912, which include shorthand notes.</p>

          <p>Freedom suit filed by Wharton on behalf of herself and her daughter. The plaintiff claims she and her daughter were the property of Elizabeth Wharton, who freed all her enslaved people in her will, proven in 1831, not the property of William H. West. She and her daughter have been seized by the sheriff and are being offered for sale to pay West's creditors.  West claims he owns Polly Wharton because Elizabeth Wharton gave him to her. Polly Wharton claims she was loaned, or hired, to West, and that Elizabeth Wharton reclaimed possession of her and received rents for her labor when West moved back into Wharton's household. In 1833, the court awarded an injunction preventing the sale, and Bayly, Administrator of Elizabeth Wharton, waived the court's demand for security. The cause wasn't dismissed until 1851. See also 1851-035, Admr. of Elixabeth Wharton vs. William H. West.

          <p>This cause contains information about enslaved people who were hired out by Zadock Nock. There are depositions given by white individuals and former enslaved people concerning which enslaved people where hired out, to whom they were hired, and for how long they were hired. The enslavers were named in the depositions. One deponent Stephen Godwin was asked when the Federal troops came into Accomack and when enslaved people were freed. Godwin was asked if he, Emma, Let, Eliza, and Handy remained in the homes of the people who hired them from the time of the arrival of the Federal troops until March 1864 when the slaves were freed in Accomack County. He was also asked about the names of the mothers of the enslaved people and their children. This cause has a copy of an agreement between James C. Taylor and Zadock Nock made on February 28, 1857 in whicj Taylor agreed to keep an enslaved woman named Mary and her children for the first year. If Mary had a child during that first year, Zadock Nock was to pay James Taylor five dollars. There is a receipt from James C. Taylor for "five dollars for keeping some negroes belonging to Z. Nock children" for the year 1857. Another receipt from "Zadock Nock in cash ten dollars in part pay for a claim against Nock for keeping some negroes belonging to the children of A. Nock. April 19, 1856."
