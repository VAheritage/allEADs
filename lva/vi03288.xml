      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Accomack County was named for the Accomac Indians, who lived on the Eastern Shore at the time of the first English settlement in Virginia. The word means "on-the-other-side-of-water place" or "across the water." It was one of the original eight shires, or counties, first enumerated in 1634 and spelled Accomac without the k. The county's name was changed to Northampton County in 1643. The present county was formed from Northampton about 1663. In October 1670, the General Assembly temporarily reunited Accomack and Northampton Counties as Northampton County. In November 1673, Accomack County was again separated from Northampton. In early records, the county's name was spelled many ways. In 1940 the General Assembly adopted the present spelling, Accomack. The county gained a small part of the southern end of Smith's Island from Somerset County, Maryland, in 1879, after the United States had approved boundary changes between Virginia and Maryland that had been agreed to in 1877. The county seat is Accomac.
</p>
      <p>A significant number of loose records from the 1700s suffered extreme water and pest damage. Volumes that record deeds, court orders, and wills exist.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Accomack County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1727-1862 (bulk 1769-1862) are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
      <p>Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>Freedom suit filed by Wharton on behalf of herself and her daughter. The plaintiff claims she and her daughter were the property of Elizabeth Wharton, who freed all her enslaved people in her will, proven in 1831, not the property of William H. West. She and her daughter have been seized by the sheriff and are being offered for sale to pay West's creditors.  West claims he owns Polly Wharton because Elizabeth Wharton gave him to her. Polly Wharton claims she was loaned, or hired, to West, and that Elizabeth Wharton reclaimed possession of her and received rents for her labor when West moved back into Wharton's household. In 1833, the court awarded an injunction preventing the sale, and Bayly, Administrator of Elizabeth Wharton, waived the court's demand for security. The cause wasn't dismissed until 1851. See also 1851-035, Admr. of Elixabeth Wharton vs. William H. West.
