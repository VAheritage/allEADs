	<p>Revolutionary naval operations were initially under the control of the Committee of Safety.  The May 1776 Convention, however, passed an ordinance "establishing a Board of Commissioners to Superintend and Direct the Naval Affairs of the Colony." The Board, given very broad powers, was "generally to superintend and direct all matters and things to the navy relating," including construction, labor, and supply. The ordinance named Thomas Whiting, John Hutchings, Champion Travis, Thomas Newton and George Webb as Commissioners (Chap. XV, May 1776).  The members selected Whiting as chairman, a position he held throughout the Board's existence.</p>
<p>In May 1779 the General Assembly passed acts creating a Board of War, with authority "to appoint a commissioner of the Navy," and discontinuing the Navy Board, as its duties and offices were to be performed by the newly established boards of war and trade.  (Chapters III and L)</p>

<p>On June 30, 1779, James Maxwell was appointed to the position of Commissioner of the Navy.  Maxwell retained this position even after the Board of War was abolished in May 1780, being appointed thereto by the governor and council.  The office was, however, abolished by the November 1781 legislative session in "An act for regulating the military and naval arrangements of this state." (Chap VIII)</p>
