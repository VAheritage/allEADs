</head>

      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Records type:</emph> Greene County (Va.) Ground Observer Corps was part of the Air Warning System established by the War Department during World II as a defense against air attack. The 1.5 million civilian observers observation posts performed naked eye and binocular searches to detect German or Japanese aircraft. Observations were telephoned to filter centers, which forwarded authenticated reports to the Aircraft Warning Service, which also received reports from Army radar stations. The program ended in 1944. Many observation posts, including the on in Greene County, were located at American Legion Posts. Each post was to have a chief observer, two assistant chief observers, and as many observers as they needed or could get so the post could be staffed on a continuous 24 hour basis.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph>Greene County was named for Nathanael Greene, commanding general of the Continental army in the South during part of the Revolutionary War. It was formed from Orange County in 1838. The county seat is Stanardsville.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>

Several volumes contained letters from the Commonwealth of Virginia Office of Civil Defense or the Norfolk Air Defense Wing concerning awards and decorations for volunteers and other issues.

One oversize item, a poster warning against trespassing by order of the U.S. Army, is housed in an oversize box.
