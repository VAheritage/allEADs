         <p>John Taylor was born December 1753 to James Taylor (d.
         1759) and Ann Taylor. After his father's death, his mother
         sent Taylor to live with his uncle Edmund Pendleton
         (1721-1803), a prominent Virginia politician. Pendleton saw to
         his nephew's education which included attending the College of
         William and Mary. Taylor studied law under Pendleton and was
         admitted to the Caroline bar in 1774. When the Revolution
         began, Taylor served as quartermaster for the 2nd Virginia
         Regiment, then the Continental Congress appointed him judge
         advocate for all Continental troops in Virginia. Congress then
         appointed him a major in the 2nd Canadian Regiment, but tired
         of not seeing active duty, then the perceived incompetence of
         his commanding officer, Taylor resigned his commission 10
         February 1779. Elected to the House of Delegates, Taylor
         served from 1779 to 1785 (excepting 1782) and 1796 to 1800. In
         1789, he retired from the practice of law to pursue his
         agricultural interests. Three times he was elected to the
         United States Senate to finish unexpired terms in 1792, 1803,
         and 1822. Elected to a full term in 1793, he resigned in 1794.
         Taylor chose not to seek reelection in 1803, and was elected
         to a full term in 1823 and served until his death. He married
         Lucy Penn (d. 1831) of North Carolina in 1782 and they had
         eight children. Taylor, a noted author on agriculture and
         politics, died in Caroline County 21 August 1824.</p>
