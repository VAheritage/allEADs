         <head>Biographical Information</head>
         <p>William Leigh was born in 1783 in Halifax County, Virginia,
         to William Leigh (1748-1787) and Elizabeth Watkins Leigh (d.
         1799). He graduated from the College of William and Mary in
         1804 and was admitted to the bar in 1805. Leigh practiced law
         and served as a judge for the Halifax County Court. He
         represented Halifax, Charlotte, and Prince Edward Counties in
         the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830. Under the
         new constitution, Leigh was appointed a judge of the Virginia
         General Court and the Circuit Superior Court of Law and
         Chancery 1n 1831, holding the former position until the
         General Court was abolished in 1851 and holding the latter
         position until he retired. Leigh married Rebecca Selden
         Watkins (1786-1852) 15 December 1807, and they had seven
         children. Leigh died at "Leighwood" in Halifax County 19 July
         1871, and was buried at St. John's Episcopal Church in Halifax
         County.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>Letters, 1825-1836, from William Leigh (1783-1871) of
         Halifax County, Virginia, to Peachy Ridgway Gilmer (1779-1836)
         of Albemarle County, Virginia, discussing Leigh's judgeship of
         the Virginia General Court and the Circuit Superior Court of
         Law and Chancery; politics; John Randolph (1773-1833); Leigh's
         son Thomas; and Gilmer's sons George (1810-1875) and (Peachy)
         Harmer (1813-1872); and personal news. Leigh writes Gilmer
         about his election to the General Court; his serving as the
         judge for the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery
         circuit which includes Halifax County, and about the various
         courts he attends. Leigh informs Gilmer about John Randolph's
         running for Congress in 1831, and later about Randolph's death
         and the controversy surrounding Randolph's wills, including a
         provision to emancipate his slaves. Leigh offers Gilmer a
         private legal opinion regarding the will of James Breckenridge
         (1763-1833) of Botetourt County, Virginia. Leigh laments the
         current political scene, stating that he is an advocate of
         states rights and secession. He fears for civil liberties and
         criticizes President Andrew Jackson (1767-1845), politicians,
         and political parties. Leigh regrets the expansion of suffrage
         in Virginia, and informs Gilmer of the election of his brother
         Benjamin Watkins Leigh (1781-1849) to the United States Senate
         by the Virginia legislature. Leigh updates Gilmer on George
         Gilmer's legal career in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, and
         Harmer Gilmer's medical career in Halifax County. He asks
         Gilmer to check on his son Thomas Leigh at the University of
         Virginia, expressing concerns over his studies. Collection
         also includes a letter, 17 August 1825, from Benjamin Watkins
         Leigh of Richmond, Virginia, to Gilmer, then living in Bedford
         County, Virginia, concerning efforts to prevent a call for a
         state constitutional convention.</p>
