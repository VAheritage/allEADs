<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p><title render="bold">Context for Record Type:  </title> The General Assembly on 1875 Mar. 20 passed an Act to provide for working and keeping in order the Roads of the Commonwealth 1875 Mar. 20. The legislation provided for the appointment of road commissioners by the county courts and outlined their responsibilities.</p>
<p>Before the Bird Road Act of 1932, counties were responsible for the control, construction, alteration, and maintenance of the roads and bridges in their locale. People living along sections of the road were responsible for its maintenance. An individual Surveyor of the Road was appointed from among the residents in each section of the road, to oversee the work for that section of the road.</p>
<p><title render="bold">Locality History:  </title> Greensville County was named either for Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene, commanding general of the Continental army in the South during part of the Revolutionary War, or for Sir Richard Grenville, leader of the Roanoke Island settlement of 1585. The county was formed from Brunswick County on 28 November 1780.</p>
