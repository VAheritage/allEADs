</head>
      <p>The General Assembly passed an act on March 29, 1871 to provide for the organization of the Volunteer Militia of the State, and to repeal existing laws concerning the same. The militia, known as the Virginia Volunteers, was to consist of volunteers to be called into service in case of war, invasion, riots, etc. On March 17, 1884, another act was passed by the General Assembly to provide for the organization, maintenance and government of the Virginia volunteers. This act stipulated that the Virginia Volunteers should consist of no more than sixty companies of infantry, eight batteries of artillery, and ten troops of cavalry.
</p>
      <p>On June 23, 1903, the Mayor of Richmond requested assistance from the Governor to suppress the riots as a result of the strike by the motormen and conductors of the Virginia Passenger and Power Company. The 70th regiment of Virginia Volunteers commanded by Col. George Wayne Anderson and the Richmond Light Infantry Blues Battalion were ordered to report for duty. The regiment was ordered to protect the property of the company.</p>

          <p>This volume also includes a loose 5-page report from an unknown source (possibly Col. George Wayne Anderson, Commanding the 70th Regiment) written on Richmond Grays stationary dated July 31, 1903. The report details the actions taken by Companies A and C of the 70th Regiment Virginia Volunteers against a mob which assembled on June 23, 1903, in the City of Richmond. The last page of the report includes a rough map of the area in which the confrontation took place.</p>
