         <p>Jacob Eschbach Yoder was born 22 February 1838 in
         Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to Jacob Maurer Yoder (d.
         1854) and Anna Eschbach Yoder. He attended local Mennonite
         schools and the Millersville Normal School where he was
         educated to become a teacher. He enlisted in the 47th
         Pennsylvania Volunteer Emergency Militia in 1863, but
         apparently returned to teaching after the unit was disbanded.
         He taught school in Berks County, Pennsylvania, and Montgomery
         County in 1864 and returned to Millersville Normal School in
         1865. In 1866, Yoder became a teacher for the Freedmen's
         Bureau and traveled to Lynchburg, Virginia to teach the newly
         freed African Americans. He went to Pennsylvania in 1867 to
         continue his own education, but returned to Lynchburg to
         continue teaching in 1869. Yoder became superintendent of
         schools for the Freedmen's Bureau. By the end of the 1870s,
         Yoder had become an administrator for Lynchburg's African
         American schools. In 1881, he was appointed supervisor of
         Lynchburg's African American schools. Yoder married Anna
         Whitaker 28 June 1871 and they had 7 children. He died in
         Lynchburg 15 April 1905.</p>
