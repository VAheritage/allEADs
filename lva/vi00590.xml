<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>William Henry Fitzhugh Payne was born 27 January 1830 in Fauquier County, Virginia to Arthur Alexander Morson Payne (1804-1868) and Mary Conway Mason Fitzhugh Payne (1805-1842). Educated at the University of Missouri, the University of Virginia, and the Virginia Military Institute, Payne practiced law and became Commonwealth's attorney for Fauquier County. He married Mary Elizabeth Winston on 29 September 1852. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War, Payne entered Confederate service as captain of the Black Horse Cavalry, was promoted to major of the 4th Virginia Cavalry September 1861, to lieutenant-colonel in 1862 of the 4th Virginia cavalry, and finally to brigadier-general commanding Payne's Brigade, Fitzhugh Lee's Division and served under Jubal Early in the Shenandoah Valley. Payne was wounded at the battle of Williamsburg on 5 May 1862, and at Five Forks, 1 April 1865. Captured after Williamsburg and the day before Gettysburg, he was exchanged both times. Payne was last captured 13 April 1865 and taken to Washington DC. After his release, Payne returned to Fauquier County and his position as Commonwealth's attorney, which he held until 1869. Payne later practiced law in Warrenton, Virginia, and Washington DC and served as counsel for the Southern Railway. He also served as president of the Association of the Army of Northern Virginia, Virginia division and was a member of the Veteran Cavalry Association, Army of Northern Virginia. Payne died in Washington 29 March 1904, and was buried in the Warrenton, Virginia, cemetery.
