      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>During the colonial period of Virginia's history the
         governor, as an appointee of the Crown, was the colony's
         principal representative and upholder of royal authority.
         Although his powers were limited somewhat by the Council and
         by the laws passed by the House of Burgesses, the governor
         still had the authority to prorogue, adjourn, or dissolve the
         legislature, to confirm or veto its acts, to preside as the
         chief jurist of the colony, to command the provincial military
         forces, and to appoint many of the subordinate officers of
         government.</p>
      <p>Most of these powers, excepting the military and
         appointive, were swept away by the American Revolution. The
         several revolutionary conventions assumed the executive role
         in 1774 and 1775 until the Committee of Safety was created in
         July 1775 to function in that capacity. The constitution
         adopted in 1776 made the governor subordinate to the
         legislative branch, elected by the General Assembly and
         circumscribed by a Council of State appointed by the
         assembly.</p>
      <p>It was not until the constitution of 1851 was adopted that
         the power of the governor was strengthened appreciably. The
         Council of State was abolished, and the governor was popularly
         elected. In subsequent years his authority was consolidated
         and expanded to statute, and his veto power was restored. The
         state government reorganization act passed by the General
         Assembly on April 18, 1927, firmly established the governor as
         the chief administrative officer of a government composed of
         departments, the directors of which serve at the pleasure of
         the governor. In addition, the organization of the governor's
         staff has increased in size and complexity until it has become
         virtually a department itself: the Office of the Governor,
         encompassing both the chief executive and his staff.</p>

                  Advisory Council on Furnishing and Interpreting the

                  Committee on Furnishing and Interpreting the

                  as correspondence with members of the Citizens'

                  Council on Furnishing and Interpreting the Executive
                  Mansion transferred these files to the Office of the
                  Director of the Executive Mansion in 1987. These
