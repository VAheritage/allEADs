<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Southampton County was formed in 1749 from Isle of Wight County.  Part of Nansemond County was added in 1785.  Southampton County was named for the borough of Southampton in England.
</p>
<p>Prior to 1853, when the Commonwealth began recording vital statistics, Virginia marriages were recorded at the county or city level.  Beginning in 1661, in order to be married by license, the groom was required to go before the county clerk and give bond with security that there was no lawful reason to prevent the marriage.  The license, issued then by the clerk, was given to the minister who performed the service.  Written consent from a parent or guardian was needed for individuals younger than twenty-one years.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Southampton County (Va.) Marriage Register, 1750-1853, is two separate volumes--labeled Part I and II.  Part I covering pages 1-359, 1750-1826, records the date of the marriage bond, the names of both parties, the names of the parents or guardians present and the names of the security or witnesses in attendance.  Between 1800-1825, pages 137-354, there are numerous entries for marriages between "free persons of color"--sometimes also designated with FN for free negro.  At the beginning of this volume, there is a contents list and notes for both volumes--such as variant spellings of first and last names are found in parentheses.
</p>
<p>The second volume covering pages 360-624, 1826-1853, records the same information as the first volume.  There are also, in this volume as well, numerous entries for marriages between "free persons of color"--dating from 1827-1850, pages 374-590.  The remainder of the volume contains additional material:  list of marriage bonds (p. 625) with no date and recorded alphabetically by the groom's surname;  list of marriage consents (pp. 626-627) with no date and recorded alphabetically by the groom's surname;  list of ministers' bonds (which celebrate the rites of matrimony) (1803, 1810) (pages 628-629) dating from and recorded chronologically;  ministers' returns (which list the marriages celebrated) (pages 630-729) dating from 1781-1851 and recorded in semi-chronological order from a loose leaf list; list of ministers' returns (pages 730-732) dating from a volume (1816-1845) and recorded in chronological order; list of ministers' returns (pages 733-739) dating from a volume (1850-1853) and recorded in semi-chronological order.  In this last section, there are also ministers' returns dating from 1845, 1847-1849.  In addition, pages 625-739 include such information as the minister's name and the religious denomination of the minister.  Pages 673-679 note when a marriage license or bond was obtained.  Amongst these pages, there are numerous entries of marriages between "persons of free color"--dating from 1800-1853, pages 655-738.  Of special note on page 638, there is an entry for a slave marriage (January 7th, 1786.)
</p>
<p>An Index to Marriage Records, 1750-1853, is a separate volume.  This index is arranged alphabetically from A-Y by the last and first names of both parties.  Alternate spellings of last names are included with a "see" reference following the standard spelling.  Variant spellings of names as well as aliases are found in parentheses.
