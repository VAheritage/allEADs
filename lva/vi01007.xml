      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The Geological Survey of Virginia was conducted in two
         phases. First, under an act passed by the General Assembly on
         March 6, 1835, a geological reconnaissance of the state was
         made to compile data of a general nature on geological
         features, and chemical compositions of soils, minerals and
         mineral waters for a report to the next session of the General
         Assembly.</p>
      <p>Then the geological survey itself, which was devoted to a
         more detailed study than the reconnaissance, was established
         by an act of the General Assembly on February 26, 1836. This
         survey was to provide a careful and accurate chemical
         examination and analysis of various soils, and principal ores,
         marls, saline and mineral waters. Other goals of the survey
         were to determine the height of principal mountains, construct
         a complete geological map of the state for engraving, and to
         collect and catalog specimens of rocks, fossils, ores,
         mineral, compounds, and organic remains, so that there would
         be a sufficient amount to distribute to institutions of higher
         learning. Both acts called for the appointment of a geologist
         by the Board of Public Works, and in each case Professor
         William Barton Rogers of the University of Virginia was
         appointed. He was responsible for supervising the survey,
         submitting annual reports on its progress, rendering
         geological sections and a geological map of the state,
         analyzing minerals and waters for their chemical content, and
         distilling all the collected data into a final report at the
         conclusion of the survey. Members of his staff included
         William A.E. Aikin, George W. Boyd, Caleb Briggs, Jr., Charles
         B. Hayden, James Rogers and Israel Slade.</p>
      <p>William Barton Rogers was born in Philadelphia,
         Pennsylvania, on December 7, 1804, the son of a professor of
         physical sciences. He attended the College of William and Mary
         in 1820 and 1821, taught school at Windsor, Maryland, in 1826,
         was appointed a lecturer at the Maryland Institute in
         Baltimore in 1827, and succeeded his father in 1828 as
         professor of chemistry and physics at the College of William
         and Mary. On February 9, 1835, when enthusiasm for a
         geological survey of Virginia was running strong in the
         General Assembly where a bill had been introduced, Rogers
         appeared before a House committee appointed to study the
         matter and drafted the committee's report to the House of
         Delegates recommending the establishment of the survey. The
         next evening, February 10, 1835, Rogers delivered an
         extemporaneous address to a joint session of the House and
         Senate describing the benefits of a geological survey to the
         state. As a result of Rogers's efforts, the General Assembly
         passed a bill on March 6, 1835, authorizing the Board of
         Public Works "to appoint a suitable person to make a
         geological reconnoissance of the state, with a view to the
         general geological features of our territory . . . and to
         report to the next general assembly a plan for the prosecution
         of a geological survey of the state." The board appointed
         William B. Rogers to the position on March 25, and he accepted
         it on April 2. His brother Henry Darwin Rogers was appointed
         as his assistant.</p>
      <p>The geological survey was continued by annual
         appropriations of state funds until 1842, when the General
         Assembly terminated the project because of a financial
         recession. In 1844 Rogers engaged Russell Smith, a
         Pennsylvania artist, to draw sketches and sections for the
         final report. Unfortunately, the money necessary to complete
         the report was never authorized by the General Assembly,
         although Rogers continued to hold the records of the survey
         until his death in the hope of receiving funds.</p>
      <p>Rogers spent the summer of 1835 in the field, making notes
         for his report, collecting samples of rocks, ores, and mineral
         waters for chemical analysis, and compiling data for
         geological sections of the state to show the different mineral
         strata. In August he accepted a call to the chair of natural
         philosophy at the University of Virginia. The first half of
         the school year was employed in teaching and in drawing
         sections, analyzing specimens, and drafting his report to the
         General Assembly. The report was submitted to the House of
         Delegates by Governor Littleton W. Tazewell as president of
         the Board of Public Works on January 11, 1836. The report met
         with the approval of the General Assembly, which passed an act
         on February 29, 1836. Rogers was expected to make annual
         reports on the progress of the survey, as well as a final
         report when the survey was completed.</p>
      <p>In the spring Rogers gave his assistants their orders for
         the season, pointing out particular areas for investigation.
         Until the school year ended Rogers was confined to the
         University, maintaining contact with his assistants in the
         field through the unreliable mail system. The assistants tried
         their best to keep Rogers informed as to their activities and
         whereabouts, their problems with sick horses, broken
         instruments, and lack of funds. As soon as he could, Rogers
         took to the field himself, visiting his assistants, conducting
         his own investigations and traveling to other states to study
         and compare the geology of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New
         England. When the University reconvened Rogers returned to
         Charlottesville, once again relying on the mails to
         communicate with his asistants. As winter approached the
         assistants visited Rogers on their way to their homes, turning
         reports and specimens over to him for study during the winter.
         By the first of the new year Rogers had prepared his annual
         report for the General Assembly and was making plans for the
         ensuing season. After the Panic of 1837, Rogers was forced to
         worry each year about whether the survey would be continued
         for another year.</p>
      <p>In 1853 Rogers resigned his position at the University of
         Virginia, wishing to move to Boston, Massachusetts, to work
         with his brother Henry. Before leaving Virginia, however,
         Rogers spent almost three months in early 1853 in Richmond, in
         a last, futile attempt to persuade the General Assembly to
         fund the final report. On March 8, 1854, Rogers left Virginia
         for Boston and a new career as a founder and first president
         of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Even after he
         left Virginia, Rogers continued to seek funding for the final
         report, but did not succeed. On May 30, 1882, as he was
         delivering a commencement address at MIT, Rogers collapsed and
         died.</p>
      <p>Rogers's widow, Emma Savage Rogers, began a time consuming
         project of sifting through her husband's papers, selecting
         some for publication and destroying others. She presented the
         surviving papers to the Virginia State Library in two lots,
         the first aobut 1900 and the second on May 10, 1903. At first
         the papers were supposed to be the personal papers of William
         B. Rogers and were so described. However, the Archives staff
         came to realize that the documents were in fact state records
         which Rogers kept in his possession pending the writing of his
         final report. Accordingly, the records are now regarded as a
         subgroup within the records of the Board of Public Works.
         Records primarily concerned with the adminstration of the
         funds for the survey by the second auditor and the Board of
         Public Works have been described already by John S. Salmon,
         comp., in Board of Public Works Inventory (Richmond: Virginia
         State Library, 1978), entry 21, "Geological Survey."</p>
      <p>William E. A. Aikin, of Maryland, appointed assistant
         geologist effective June 1, 1837. Resigned April 13, 1839. Was
         teaching at the Baltimore Medical School in 1873; George W.
         Boyd, of New York, appointed assistant geologist on May 1,
         1838. He died of asthma on September 23, 1840, in the home of
         William B. Rogers at the University of Virginia,
         Charlottesville; Caleb Briggs, Jr., of New York, appointed
         assistant geologist on June 1, 1839. He was paid for his
         services to July 1, 1842; Charles B. Hayden (January 22,
         1817-January 28, 1883), of Connecticut, attended the College
         of William and Mary, and probably was a student of William B.
         Rogers, 1834-1835. Appointed assistant geologist effective
         April 1, 1837. Board of Public Works received notice that he
         had "retired from the service" on June 11, 1840. He taught
         school in Smithfield, Virginia, and later became a lawyer;
         Samuel Lewis, appointed assistant geologist effective June 1,
         1840. He was paid for his services to March 1, 1841; Thomas S.
         Ridgeway, Jr., appointed assistant geologist on April 15,
         1840. He was paid for his services to June 2, 1842; Henry
         Darwin Rogers (August 1, 1808-May 29, 1866), of Philadelphia,
         Pennsylvania, appointed assistant geologist on April 2, 1836.
         Resignation received by the Board of Public Works on May 8,
         1837. Directed New Jersey and Pennsylvania state geological
         surveys, later collaborated with William B. Rogers on a paper
         concerning mountain elevation; James Blythe Rogers (February
         11, 1802-June 15, 1852), of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
         appointed assistant geologist in May 1837. Resignation
         received by the Board of Public Works on April 15, 1840.
         Reappointed assistant geologist on May 1, 1841. He was paid
         for his services to August 1, 1842. The major contribution of
         his career was the development of methods of chemical
         analysis.</p>
      <p>Robert Empie Rogers (March 29, 1813-September 6, 1884), of
         Baltimore, Maryland. He was a chemist with the Pennsylvania
         Geological Survey and was professor of chemistry at the
         University of Virginia, where he collaborated with William B.
         Rogers, and at the University of Pennsylvania; Israel Slade,
         of Pittstown, New York. Employed by William B. Rogers
         (accepted offer on April 16, 1838) who paid him with his own
         funds. Appointed assistant geologist on April 15, 1840. He was
         paid for his services to July 1, 1842; A Maxwell Walker,
         appointed topographical surveyor on May 5, 1836. His
         resignation was received by the Board of Public Works on March
         11, 1837; William Thompson Russell Smith (April 26,
         1812-November 8, 1896), known as Russell Smith, was born in
         Glasgow, Scotland, but moved to Pennsylvania in 1819 with his
         parents. The family eventually settled in Pittsburgh, where
         Smith became interested in painting and drama. He combined the
         two interests by painting scenery for the stage, and had a
         successful career that took him eventually to Philadelphia,
         Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. It was probably while he lived
         in Milestown near Philadelphia during the late 1830's and
         early 1840's that Smith became acquainted with William B.
         Rogers on one of the geologist's visits to the area. Rogers
         engaged Smith to execute a series of drawings of significant
         geological formations in Virginia for use in Rogers's
         projected final report on the state geological survey. Smith
         travelled to Charlottesville in June 1844, and from July to
         September he and Rogers explored western Virginia. Smith used
         the resulting sketches for his own benefit as well as for
         Rogers's, making them the basis for oil landscapes for
         exhibition. Eventually he mailed the sketches to Rogers for
         him to keep.</p>

      <p>The correspondence to Rogers was primarily from his
         assistants. Also included are letters from George W. Summers,
         member of the House of Delegates, and James Brown, Jr., Second
         Auditor of Virginia. There were also letters from Rogers and a
         letter from Emma Rogers his wife, to William W. Scott,
         Librarian of the State Library.</p>
      <p>The field notes and reports are from 1834 to 1884. William
         B. Rogers was one of four brothers, all of whom were noted
         chemists and geologists. Two brothers, Henry Darwin Rogers and
         James Blythe Rogers, served as his assistants at different
         times during the conduct of the survey, while the third,
         Robert Empie Rogers, contributed his observations on the
         geology of the Northern Neck. Rogers's other assistants,
         appointed by the Board of Public Works, were: William E. A.
         Aikin, George W. Boyd, Caleb Briggs, Jr., Charles B. Hayden,
         Samuel Lewis, Thomas S. Ridgeway, Jr., Henry Darwin Rogers,
         James Blythe Rogers, Robert Empie Rogers, Israel Slade and A.
         Maxwell Walker. In the spring, Rogers gave his assistants
         their orders for the season, pointing out particular areas for
         investigation, and as winter aproached the assistants gave him
         reports on the geological, chemical and topographical
         discoveries which they had made.</p>
      <p>Rogers personally hired a Pennsylvania artist, Russell
         Smith, to make drawings for the final report; Smith and Rogers
         spent most of the summer of 1844 afield for this purpose. The
         51 sketches depict geographical features and are done on paper
         and cardboard, in ink, pencil, pastels, oils and
         watercolor.</p>

                     Rogers, University of Virginia, saying that he had
                     heard that Rogers's report concerning the coal of
                     Chesterfield County placed the coal taken from Mr.
                     Heth's deep mine in a category inferior to any
                     other south side coal; that it was the impression
                     in Richmond that Heth's coal was in fact superior
                     rather than inferior; that there may have been an
                     error in the Printing of Rogers's report; that if
                     such was the case it should be corrected through
                     early publication in the newspapers; and that
                     Gwathmey would be glad to see to this correciton

                     his health; informing him that some members of the

                     publication of his geological report and that he

                     geological survey made; asking him that if he

                     published reports as he could spare and a brief

                     economic benefits of such a survey; stressing the

              <abstract>South fork of the south Branch of the
                     Potomac. Pencil. Undated. Notes on reverse: No. 1
                     and 2. Two very large tulip trees. No. 1 over 100
                     feet high. 3. Black walnut. 4. Sycamore. Color of
                     Gold. 5. Decayed sycamore also very large. The two
                     spots on Bullpasture mountain are smooth walls of
                     light grey Rock. The River is low, leaving in the
                     foreground pools of water with every variety of
                     plants. The dark shadow on Mt. falls in
                     beautifully with the tall dark poplar and spreads
                     out up over the mountain to the night. The general
                     tone is dark. Principal light high up in the sky
                     and the 2nd on the shore. Sky Constable like or
                     English like. From the presence of so much walnut
                     and Sycamore I see none of the cold heavy greens
                     noticed in Cole's 2nd picture of the "Voyage of
                     life" but all is warm and harmonizing with the
                     shadows.</abstract>

                     colour. All left of the falls being light yellow
                     and grey. That to the right is dark green and
                     purpleish grey, almost black in places. The light
                     is from the right and high. The trees are Buckeye,
                     Sycamore, and Elm. Some with raies[?]. Although
                     the work yellowish is used there is nothing yellow
                     appearing in the whole ruin except the R.'s hat.
                     Portions of the falls are shaded by tree tops and
                     jutting rocks. Small portions received the
                     sunlight and are of the brightest
                     white.</abstract>
