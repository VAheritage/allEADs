      <p>Founded in 1778 by William Hickman, Skinquarter Church is
         the second oldest continuous Baptist congregation in
         Chesterfield County, Virginia. The first church was built on
         Hickman's farm in 1778, the same year he was ordained a
         Baptist minister. In 1836, the church withdrew from the Middle
         District Baptist Association and joined several other
         conservative local churches to form the Zoar Association. In
         1848, it rejoined Middle District. The present church building
         was constructed in 1890, with additions made in 1974. For more
         information see, HICKMAN'S HALF-ACRE: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY
         OF SKINQUARTER BAPTIST CHURCH, 1778-1978, AND CEMETERY
         INTERMENT RECORDS, 1880-1917, by George Andrew Beadles, Jr.,
         and Harriette Mooring Horner, 1978.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Includes four volumes of minute books, an account book, and
         five deeds. The first volume of minutes covers the years 1824
         to 1844. Membership lists appear on pages 3-17 (Accession
         26297). The second volume covers the years 1868 to 1879.
         Resolutions of respect concerning the church are entered on
         page 191. Membership lists appear on pages 1-4, 179-184, and
         188-190. The third volume of minutes covers the years 1880 to
         1896. It begins with the constitution and by-laws of the
         church, followed by the rules of decorum and a membership
         list. Membership lists appear on pages 10-15 and 272-276. The
         fourth volume of minutes dates from 1896 to 1915. It includes
         a list of officers, rules of decorum, membership lists, and
         minutes. Membership lists appear on pages 11-19. (The second,
         third, and fourth volumes are Accession 29968).</p>
      <p>The account book is for the year 1895, and lists male and
         female members of the church and indicates the amount of money
         paid for an unknown cause. It also contains copies of receipts
         to the treasurer of the church (Accession 31342).</p>
      <p>There are also five deeds, dating from 1784 to 1860, which
         record transfers of land owned by the church (Accession
         28288).</p>
