</head>
      <p>Lynchburg in Campbell County, was named for John Lynch, the owner of the original town site. It was established in 1786, was incorporated as a town in 1805, and became a city in 1852.
</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Lynchburg (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1805-1945, are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff complaint), answers (defendant response), decrees (court decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
      <p>The collection includes chancery causes heard in the Superior Court of Chancery for the Lynchburg District seated in the city of Lynchburg between 1814 and 1831. The district consisted of the following localities: Amherst County, Bedford County, Campbell County, Franklin County, Henry County, Patrick County, Pittsylvania County, and the city of Lynchburg. Suits that originated in these localities are found in this collection.
</p>
      <p>The Superior Courts of Chancery were created in 1802 to expedite the hearing of chancery suits. Each court heard cases from the localities which constituted its chancery district. The court met at one location in the district and its records were kept in that one location. The Superior Courts of Chancery were abolished in 1831.
</p>
  <p>Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.</p>

          <p>Jeremiah was the brother of Elizabeth's husband Adin Gray. Jeremiah accused Elizabeth of selling and lending out of state (Maryland) enslaved people she received as part of her dower from her husband's estate. He claimed she violated an act of assembly passed in 1785. Consequently, Elizabeth forfeited her balance of the enslaved people. Also, the plaintiff argued that Elizabeth at age 80 was too old to manage his brother's estate and allowed it to go to waste. The cause includes depositions defending Elizabeth's ability to manage the estate claiming she regularly came the assistance of females in difficult cases. One deponent said that Elizabeth married Adin because she owed him 100 pounds for building a mill. She could not repay the debt so she agreed to marry him.

They would then receive a substantial legacy from Burton's estate. Moreover, they were to be emancipated as soon as the laws of the Commonwealth permitted it.

          <p>John N. Rose sued the Carter family to recover wages owed to him for building an addition to the Carter home on Walnut Grove plantation in Nelson County in 1795. He built it for John Champe Carter and his wife Apphia. The reason the Carters gave for not paying Rose was that he never finished building the addition. Rose learned that the Carter family planned to auction eighty-eight enslaved people with proceeds from the sale to be divided among Carter family members. Rose wanted the court to have the Carters pay him what he was owed from the proceeds they receive from the sell of the enslaved people. Cause includes an inventory of enslaved people that list their names, age, and value. Unusual reference found in the deposition of Robert S. Rose. He was asked by the plaintiff if he knew Frank Floyd who was once owned by Robert's father and did he know what proportion of colored blood he has. Rose said that Frank was the son of Sarah Floyd who was the daughter of Betsey Dean, a mulatto. Her mother was black and her father was a white Englishman, an indentured servant to the deponent's grandfather. Sarah married a white man named Mitchel Floyd who died during the Revolutionary War.

          <p>Cause involved a dispute related to the estate of Nathaniel Harlow. Brownlee was married to Harlow's daughter Susannah. He accused the defendants of denying his wife her fair share of her estate left to her in her father's will. The defendants' response was that Susannah was denied her portion of the estate because of her and Brownlee's bad character. They questioned the legitimacy of Susannah's marriage to Brownlee. At the time of their marriage, she was already married to James West who was still alive and resided in Kentucky. He was the son of an slaved person named Cillar. There are numerous depostions that attack Brownlee's character. Witnesses accused of him of murdering his first wife, being a drunkard, and operating a brothel out of his house in Waynesboro, Virginia. Witnesses describe Susannah as being "a large woman" who could not take care of herself. Brownlee hired people to assist him in taking care of her. Exhibits in the suit include Nathaniel Harlow's will, list of enslaved people owned by Harlow and their value, and James Brownlee and Susannah West's marriage certificate.
