      <head>Historical Information
</head>
<p><title render="bold">Context of Record type:</title> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.</p>
<p><title render="bold">Types of Courts:</title> The Superior Courts of Chancery were created in 1802 to expedite the hearing of chancery suits. Each court heard cases from the localities which constituted its chancery district. The court met at one location in the district and its records were kept in that one location. The Superior Courts of Chancery were abolished in 1831.</p>
<p>The Superior Court of Chancery for the Lynchburg District existed between 1814 and 1831. The district consisted of the following localities: Amherst County, Bedford County, Campbell County, Franklin County, Henry County, Patrick County, Pittsylvania County, and the city of Lynchburg.</p>
      <p><title render="bold">Locality History:</title> Lynchburg was named for John Lynch, the owner of the original town site. It was established in 1786, was incorporated as a town in 1805, and became a city in 1852. Parts of Campbell and Bedford Counties were annexed to the city in 1976.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Lynchburg (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1805-1964, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.
</p>
      <p>The collection includes chancery causes heard in the Superior Court of Chancery for the Lynchburg District seated in the city of Lynchburg between 1814 and 1831. The district consisted of the following localities: Amherst County, Bedford County, Campbell County, Franklin County, Henry County, Patrick County, Pittsylvania County, and the city of Lynchburg. Suits that originated in these localities are found in this collection.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>Jeremiah Gray was Elizabeth Gray's brother-in-law, her husband's brother. Jeremiah accused Elizabeth of selling and lending enslaved people out of state. The enslaved people were part of a dower she had received from her husband's estate after his death. Jeremiah claimed Elizabeth had violated an act of assembly passed in 1785 by selling the enslaved people out of state. Jeremiah also argued that Elizabeth, at age 80, was too old to manage his brother's estate and allowed it to go to waste. The cause includes depositions defending Elizabeth's ability to manage the estate claiming she regularly came to the assistance of women in difficult cases. One deponent said that Elizabeth married Adin because she owed him 100 pounds for building a mill. She could not repay the debt so she agreed to marry him.

Jenetta was the wife of Thomas Bowles, a "free" African-American man. The executor interpreted Burton's will to mean the enslaved women could hire themselves out to whomever they chose in order to support themselves until they married a "free" person. They would then receive a substantial legacy from Burton's estate. Moreover, they were to be emancipated as soon as the laws of the Commonwealth permitted it. The heirs of Burton did not agree with the executor's interpretation of Burton's will and contested the terms in court.

          <p>John N. Rose sued the Carter family to recover wages owed to him for building an addition to the Carter home on Walnut Grove plantation in Nelson County in 1795. He built it for John Champe Carter and his wife Apphia. The reason the Carters gave for not paying Rose was that he never finished building the addition. Rose learned that the Carter family planned to auction eighty-eight enslaved people with proceeds from the sale to be divided among Carter family members. Rose wanted the court to have the Carters pay him what he was owed from the proceeds they receive from the sell of the enslaved people. Cause includes an inventory of enslaved people that list their names, age, and value. Unusual reference found in the deposition of Robert S. Rose. He was asked by the John Rose if he knew Frank Floyd, who was once enslaved by Robert's father, if so, did Robert know Floyd's ancestry. Robert Rose said Frank was the son of Sarah Floyd who was the daughter of Betsey Dean, a mixed-race woman. Betsey Dean's mother was black and her father was a white Englishman, an indentured servant to the deponent's grandfather. Sarah married a white man named Mitchel Floyd who died during the Revolutionary War.

<p>Described in this debt suit, Fanny O'Connor was enslaved by Henry Lyne, along with her children. Fanny was purportedly Lyne's illegitimate daughter and he emancipated Fanny and her children in his will. Their emancipation was to take place shortly after the General Assembly passed an act ordering all former enslaved people emancipated after May 1, 1806 to leave the Commonwealth. To avoid removing Fanny and her children from the state, the executor kept them on Lyne's estate. When Lyne's estate was inventoried, Fanny and her children were appraised as enslaved property despite the fact they were not. Also, Fanny was permitted to go at large in the community as a "free person" which upset people in the community. In response, the executor removed Fanny and her children from the state, so that they could enjoy their freedom.</p>
