      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>The separate office of coroner appeared in Virginia about 1660. The judicial duty of the office is to hold inquisitions in cases when persons meet sudden, violent, unnatural or suspicious death, or death without medical attendance. The coroner would summon a jury to assist him in determining cause of death. Prior to November 1877, the jurors numbered twelve. Between November 1877 and March 1926, the jurors numbered six. The jury viewed the body of the deceased and heard the testimony of witnesses. The coroner was required to write down witness testimony. After seeing and hearing the evidence, the jury delivered in writing to the coroner their conclusion concerning cause of death referred to as the inquisition. After March 1926, only the coroner determined cause of death. He could require physicians to assist him with determing cause of death. If a criminal act was determined to be the cause of death, the coroner was to deliver the guilty person to the sheriff and the coroners' inquests would be used as evidence in the criminal trial.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Russell County (Va) Coroners' Inquisitions, 1883-1905, are investigations into the deaths of individuals who died by a sudden, violent, unnatural or suspicious manner, or died without medical attendance. Causes of death found in coroners' inquisitions include murder, infanticide, suicide, domestic violence, exposure to elements, drownings, train accidents, automobile accidents, and natural causes, or as commonly referred to in the 19th century, visitation by God. Documents commonly found in coroners' inquests include the inquisition, depositions, and summons. Criminal papers such as recognizance bonds can be found in coroner inquisitions. Information found in the inquisition include the name of the coroner, the names of the jurors, the name and age of the deceased if known, gender and race of the deceased, and when, how, and by what means the deceased came to his or her death. If the deceased was African American, these particular inquests identify the person as colored. Information found in the depositions include the name of the deponent and his or her account of the circumstances that led to the death of the deceased.

          <p>Rollins (aka Martin Roland) died at the hands of a mob of men who took him from jail by force, conveyed him to Little Cedar Creek one mile East of Lebanon and there hung him and shot him until he was dead. Depositions from eyewitnesses describe events as they unfolded, often in graphic detail, although no persons are identified by deponents.

          <p>The infant died by violence left unexplained in the inquisition, although it resulted in the arrest of a young woman named Mollie Mead (Meade). Depositions provide details regarding infant's body and Mollie Mead's possible concealing of pregnancy. Infant's body was found by a neighbor's dogs; a cloth or dress had been wrapped around the infant's head and arms; a small strip of clothing also was wrapped around the paperwork filed with the inquest.

          <p>Died by blows, licks, and other abuse from "Sife Gint" by unmercifully beating her with sticks, boards, or some other instrument.

Although she appeared to have suffered with measles during the month prior to her death, most deponents believe her death was a result of having been beaten.
