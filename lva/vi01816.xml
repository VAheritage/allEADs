      <p>Edmund Randolph (1753-1813) attended the College of William and Mary from 1770 to 1771 and studied law. He served in the Fifth Virginia Convention which adopted the state's first constitution.

Randolph was elected governor of Virginia in 1786 and served until 1788. Randolph also attended the Federal Constitutional Convention in 1787 and the state ratifying convention in 1788.
