<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>York County originally was named Charles River County, for King Charles I, and was one of the eight shires, or counties, first enumerated in 1634. A record of 7 January 1634 employs the name York County, and a statute of 1643 officially changed the name to York County, probably in honor of James, duke of York, the second son of King Chares I, and later King James II.
</p>
<p>Individuals dying with a written will died testate. After the death of an individual, his or her will was brought into court, where two of the subscribing witnesses swore that the document was genuine. After the will was proved, the executor was bonded to carry out his or her duties to settle the estate. The court then ordered the will to be recorded. 
</p>
<p>Thomas Nelson Jr. is regarded as on of the U.S. Founding Fathers since he signed the Declaration of Independence as a member of the Virginia delegation. Nelson represented York County in the House of Burgesses from 1761 to 1775. He represented York County in the House of Delegates from 1777-1783 and from 1786 to 1788. He was a general in the Virginia militia and commanded the militia from 1777-1781. He led three thousand Virginia militiamen in General George Washington's Army during the siege at Yorktown. He represented Virginia in the Continental Congress from 1775 to 1777 and was its Governor from 1781 June 12-November 22. He resigned as Governor due to ill health.  Nelson died in York County (some accounts say Hanover County), on 4 January 1789.  He is buried in Grace Church Cemetery in Yorktown.  According to his will, he owned land in Hanover, James City, York, Warwick, Loudon and Prince William counties as well as the City of Williamsburg. He was a slave owner and mentions the following slaves in this will: Aggy, Charles, Melinda, Nancy and James Rideout. Only one slave, Smith Harry, was given his freedom.
</p>
<p>Recognized in 1634 as an original shire. Most pre-Revolutionary War-era loose records are missing. Volumes that record deeds, court orders, and wills exist.
</p>
<p>The 18th century Wills were created by the County Court.</p>
