      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><title render="bold">Context for Record Type:</title> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories. 
</p>
      <p><title render="bold">Locality History:</title> Hanover County was named for George I, who at the time of his ascent to the English throne was elector of Hanover in Germany. The county was formed from New Kent in 1720. The county seat is Hanover.
</p>
      <p><title render="bold">Lost Locality Notes:</title> Most county court records, particularly deeds, wills, and marriage records, were destroyed by fire in Richmond on 3 April 1865, where they had been moved for safekeeping during the Civil War. The circuit court records were not moved to Richmond and were relatively unscathed. Consequently, there is a strong run of common law papers and chancery papers after 1831 that were generated by the circuit superior court of law and chancery and its successor, the circuit court.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Hanover County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1831-1913, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.
</p>
      <p>Due to Hanover County's proximity to Richmond, a center for the American slave trade, many chancery causes prior to 1865 contain information concerning enslaved Black men, women, and children. While there are several suits concerning the freedom of enslaved individuals, these cases largely represent the perspective of white enslavers and their disputes involving the sale, hiring, financial responsibilities, and legality of ownership of Black individuals. Many specifically involve the business of selling enslaved people further south to resolve debts and increase wealth. 
</p>
<p>In the chancery causes from before 1865, a number of enslaved individuals are described as being hired out by their enslavers to do work such as building a road or rail line. Many enslaved people are also described as knowing a trade, such as carpentry and smithing. </p>

          <p>Mahala, a "free woman of color," lived in Hanover County prior to her death in 1831. John Bowe, Mahala's enslaver, emancipated Mahala in 1824. Col. Thomas Tinsley enslaved Mahala prior to John Bowes. John Bowe additionally emancipated an unnamed "mulatto" girl, after purchasing her from Mrs. Bowler which was documented in the Hanover Court. John Bowe wished to educate both Mahala and the unnamed girl. Mahala died and her will was recorded in 1831. In her will, Mahala states that she purchased her children from Col. Thomas Tinsley.

          <p>Betsey Bazinett stated that she was a "free woman of color" because she was the daughter of Matilda Bazinett, also free.  John, Betsey's father, was enslaved by Charles Tinsley and worked as a blacksmith. Due to their circumstances, Betsey's parents  were separated. Betsey was put into the custody of her father's mother. Betsey fled from Tinsley's property upon discovering that he wished to deprive Betsey of her freedom and planned to remove her to parts unknown. Betsey was afraid that she would be seized upon and sold.

          <p>Lucy Dickinson was the aunt of James B. Cason.  Lucy was said to be a weakly woman, illiterate and under his influence. James was said to be a gambler and drinker. John was said to verbally abuse Dickinson and had forged Virginia Central Railroad stock in her name. Dickinson also owned a considerable number of enslaved persons who helped her manage her plantation known as "Queens." These enslaved individuals used to drive a cart and team in hauling coal and wood and going to the mill. Cason considered them "burdensome, unmanageable and unproductive" primarily because Dickinson was said to "indulge" the people she enslaved and managed them through leniency. Cason sold and hired out a number of these individuals  for money, such as Fanny, who was sold to Fendall Carpenter, a slave trader from Tennessee.
