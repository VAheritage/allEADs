</head>
        <p>This volume was collated and restored by the Yorktown Branch of the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (APVA) in 1933 from the original records found in the York County Circuit Court Clerk's Office.  The negative photostatic copy of this volume was created by the Virginia State Library's (now Library of Virginia) Archives Division.  The microfilm copy of this volume was generated by The Genealogical Society of Utah--while filming at the York County Circuit Court Clerk's Office in 1954.

      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>York County was originally named Charles River County.  It was formed in 1634 and given its present name in 1643.
</p>
      <p>Prior to 1853, when the Commonwealth began recording vital statistics, Virginia marriages were recorded at the county or city level. Beginning in 1661, in order to be married by license, the groom was required to go before the county clerk and give bond with security that there was no lawful reason to prevent the marriage. The bond was pledged, with two or more sufficient securities (or witnesses), but no money was exchanged.  The license, issued then by the clerk, was given to the minister who performed the service.  The practice of bonding was discontinued in 1849, although in some communities bonds were pledged into the 1850s.  This practice insured against legal action should the marriage not take place, if either party declined to go through with the union, or if one of the parties were found to be ineligible for marriage--if either the bride or groom were already married or was underage and lacked approval to wed.  Written consent from a parent or guardian was needed for individuals younger than twenty-one years.
</p>
      <p>The marriage bonds and consents of York County (Va.) described in this collection were created by the County Court.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>York County (Va.) Marriage Bonds and Consents, 1772-1849, records the original bonds of marriage between a bride and groom within the county.  This volume also contains original marriage consents.  An unnumbered typescript index, found at the beginning of the volume, was created during the volume's restoration.  This alpabetical index cross-references the bonds and consents of both the prospective bride and groom.  An asterisk next to a name indicates a consent record.  Alternate spellings of names are listed in parentheses.  A consent and marriage bond between persons of color are found on pages 274 (1842) and 422 (1830).  Pages 434-440 of this volume are not found on the microfilm copy, Reel 43, generated by The Genealogical Society of Utah.
