</head>
      <p>The development of the Dept. of Education began in 1870 when Dr. William H. Ruffner was elected by the General Assembly to be the first Superintendent of Public Instruction. At the end of its first 50 years, the department had less than 20 staff members. In 1928, the Superintendent was first appointed by the governor. Staff size was expanded to in order to meet the increased need for services including the purchase of textbooks, libraries, and general buildings services. The Commonwealth of Virginia is divided into school divisions, each of which has a school board. Each locality appoints a Division Superintendent using criteria established by the State Board of Education.The mission of Virginia's public education system is to educate students in the fundamental knowledge and academic subjects that they need to become capable, responsible, and self-reliant citizens. The mission of the Virginia Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, in cooperation with local school boards, is to increase student learning and academic achievement.</p>

It focuses on accountability, evaluation, state testing and assessment programs, curriculum, and teacher education. The Superintendent of Public Instruction serves as Secretary of the Board.</p>
