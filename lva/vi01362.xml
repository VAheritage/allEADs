      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Albemarle County was named for William Anne Keppel, second earl of Albemarle, and governor of Virginia from 1737 to 1754. It was created by a statute of 1744 and formed from Goochland County; part of Louisa County was added in 1761 and islands in the Fluvanna (now the James) River in 1770. The court met for the first time on 8 February 1745. The county seat is the city of Charlottesville.
</p>
<p>All order books except the first and many loose papers between 1748 and 1781 were destroyed by British general Banastre Tarleton's raid on Charlottesville in 1781 during the Revolutionary War.
</p>
<p>In 1806, the General Assembly moved to remove the free Black persons and free persons of color from Virginia with a law that stated that all emancipated enslaved people, freed after May 1, 1806, who remained in the Commonwealth more than a year, would forfeit their right to freedom and be sold by the Overseers of the Poor for the benefit of the parish. Free people wanting to stay were to petition the General Assembly through the local county court. Beginning in 1837, emancipated people could petition the local courts for permission to remain.
