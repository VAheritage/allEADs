<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The Court of Admiralty was created by an act of the General Assembly passed at the October 1776 session. The court received all cases then pending before the colonial maritime commissioners and had jurisdiction in all new maritime cases, except in matters involving capital offenses. The court was composed of three judges elected by the General Assembly and sat at the state capitol as the occasion required. </p>

<p>While the first ships commissioned for a Continental Navy began construction and refitting in 1775, individual colonies had issued letters of marque, or legal permission to attack and capture enemy vessels, months beforehand. On March 23, 1776, the Continental Congress began and formally allowed individual colonies to issue letters of marque to privateers across the colonies.</p>

<p>The terminology of litigation at Vice-Admiralty courts across the colonies vary. In Virginia, use of the terms libellant, respondent, proctor, proclamation and decree are common and require definition. A person seeking relief by presenting his case to the court in written form is a libellant, the complaint is the libel. After the libellant's claim was read in court, a judge issued to the court's Marshal a citation which might call for the vessel or cargo to be arrested, or call for her master (the respondent, the defendant at whom the libel was aimed) to appear before the court.  After the judge's proclamation was stated to the court with the respondent present, the respondent had the opportunity to submit a claim in reply to the libel. Requests for respondents to appear in court were published in the Virginia Gazette, allowing for one year's time to pass before the case could be settled without the respondent being present. Both parties could be represented in court by a proctor, a legal representative. After the court considered the libel, the answer and oral testimony of the witnesses, the judge pronounced a decree, or judgement, of the case. If the decree involved monetary appraisal or compensation, the Marshal of the court gave public notice of a sale, recorded the appraisal of value, and presented those findings to the court. Either the court register or the clerk kept notes of these proceeding. </p>

<p>The law of salvage at the time varied from nation to nation. Early in the American Revolution the captain and crew responsible for salvaging, or in these cases capturing, the said vessel were entitled to one-third of value of the appraised prize by merit of the risk required to bring the vessel to port. The Royal Navy's practice was to award full value for any type of enemy ship captured. In October, 1776, the outcry from privateers convinced the Continental Congress to alter the percentage. In November, 1776, privateers received all proceeds from a captured prize, while Continental or state navy crews received one-third of the prize from a transport or supply vessel and half the total prize for a vessel of war. The prize money awarded to the navy crews were divided into twentieths after the government had taken its share. One-twentieth to the commander in chief (regardless of whether he as present at the time); two-twentieths to the captain of the vessel; three-twentieths to be divided among the masters (lieutenants and marines); two and a half-twentieths divided among the master's mates (chief gunner, carpenters, surgeons); three-twentieths divided among the petty officers; and eight and a half-twentieths went to the rest of the crew. It is worth noting that the colonies and Continental Congress during the American Revolution experienced monetary inflation, and references to British pounds should not be confused with the British pound-sterling, which was not subject to the same inflation trends.</p>

<p>The Court of Admiralty was abolished by an act of the General Assembly passed on December 25, 1788, effective March 4, 1789, in pursuance of the new Constitution of the United States, which gave admiralty and maritime jurisdiction to the federal courts. Those few cases of admiralty jurisdiction not taken into the federal court system were given to the newly created state district courts. </p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection is comprised of thirty-four items, of which there are four types of documents. An account relating to Graves V. Scott, undated; one Court Transcript relating to the capture of the HMS Kingfish[er], 1779, August; thirty-one Decrees, 1777, 1780-1781, 1783-1784, 1786-1788; and one document listing the supplies and operation of the HMS Kingfish[er], 1775.
</p>

<p>The account consists of a single document recording the amount of prize sales, court costs, net proceeds, and amount to be paid to the Treasurer related to the decree of the Court of Admiralty in Williamsburg, Virginia in the case of Graves v. Scott.</p>

<p>The single court transcript relates to a case heard by the Court of the Admiralty in Williamsburg, Virginia, which occurred on August 17, August 18 and August 30, 1779. The case was initially heard on August 17th, 1779, presided over by Judges Benjamin Waller, Richard Cary, and William Roscow Wilson Curle Esq. James Montegue and the militia under his command, in compliance with the resolutions of the Continental Congress in 1776 which enabled private ships or vessels of war with Commissions of Letter of Marque and Reprisals to capture British vessels and cargo in the colonies, presented the HMS Kingfish[er] to the Court of Admiralty in Virginia. The cost of the capture and trial would first be taken out of the money derived from the sale of the prize, then according to the Laws of Salvage the captors are entitled to half of the value of the cargo. It was under these conditions that James Montegue and his militia found and seized the Pilot Boat Kingfish[er] with its tackle, apparel, furniture and cargo near the shores of the River Rappahannock on a date not added to the transcript. After the libellant, James Montegue, submitted his case the respondent, John Jones, was given until the following day to consider the libel. On August 18, 1779, the respondent John Jones motioned to adjourn the court until August 30 for him to respond. On August 30, 1779, the respondent argued that he knew nothing of the Pilot Boat Kingfish[er] being captured by James Montegue at the time stated by the libellant. John Jones stated that sometime during December, 1777, the Kingfish[er] was taken from the respondent who did not know its whereabouts until it was seen in possession of W. Carter Braxton at Portsmouth by W. Bigil Smith, a former owner of the ship, after which the respondent told Braxton by letter that the ship was his property. John Jones was then told by a Captain Lard, who was still in Braxton's employ, that he has seen the ship in the possession of Mr. Braxton before he began to use her to sail passengers and horses between Portsmouth and Hampton. John Jones then informed W. Braxton of his claim, and the boat was sent to Baltimore for the purpose of, John Jones believed, preventing him from regaining the Pilot Boat Kingfish[er]. The court then informed the respondent that when James Montegue found the ship near the River Rappahannock , it was aground with no persons on board her. Montegue then disposed possession of the ship to W. Carter Braxton, before obtaining legal right to her by publically posting libel with the Court of the Admiralty. The respondent John Jones then insisted that neither Montegue nor Braxton ever had a right, title, or property related to the Pilot Boat Kingfish[er]. He then stated that if they ever did, they forfeited those rights by illegal and deceptive steps taken to acquire her contrary to "the known and established laws in such cases." </p>

<p>The thirty-one decrees contained all follow a similar format and are the final judgements given by the Court of the Admiralty in Williamsburg Virginia, either for the libellant or for the claims of the respondent, including prize money and court cost to be paid. They are in chronological order. The libellants, respondents, prizes and value of the prizes are always listed. The presiding judges and respondents, unless otherwise noted, are not listed in the documents. In all cases present in this collection, William Russel served as the Court Clerk and Benjamin Powell served as the Marshal of the Admiralty Court in Williamsburg, Virginia. The libellant is a commissioned privateer, a member of the state or Continental navy, or a proctor who has submitted, or condemned, a captured vessel to the Vice-Admiralty Court; the respondent is either the person who formally owned the captured ship, or a proctor. Places where "other" libellants are indicated refer to the captain's crew. These documents contain neither the court proclamations nor the court citations which contributed to the decision found in the court's decree.  In this collection, all cases were found in favor of the libellant. Each decree addresses individual salvage cases, in some instances a single libellant will have multiple cases decided on the same day. Cases heard on the same day are group together in paragraphs. There is a shift in the court's rulings in some cases after 1786 where the libellant or respondent would receive money from the court, but the court would then charge the libellant or respondent a cost for the use of the court and Commonwealth. Includes the following decrees: </p>
