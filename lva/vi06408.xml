<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p><title render="bold">Context for Record Type:  </title> The Commissioner of Revenue is one of the five constitutional officers outlined in the Virginia Constitution. The chief tax authority for each locality, the Commissioner of Revenue is an elected official responsible for enforcing state and local tax laws, and auditing state and local tax returns. Beginning in 1786, the county courts were directed to divide each locality into precincts and to appoint commissioners to collect the taxes. Taxes were assessed between March and April of each year and were payable by the end of December. The commissioners prepared four "fair and correct" copies of the personal property tax books. Copies were prepared for the commissioner, county clerk, sheriff, and auditor of public accounts.</p>
<p><title render="bold">Locality History:  </title> Greensville County was named either for Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene, commanding general of the Continental army in the South during part of the Revolutionary War, or for Sir Richard Grenville, leader of the Roanoke Island settlement of 1585. The county was formed from Brunswick County on 28 November 1780.</p>
