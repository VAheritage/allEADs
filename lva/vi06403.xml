<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p><title render="bold">Context for Record Type:  </title>First known as commissioners, the Justice of the Peace office originated with the county quarterly court in 1623. Commanders of Plantations (1607-1629) were predecessors of the commissioners, who since 1662 have been called justices of the peace. They have traditionally had both civil and criminal jurisdiction. They also served other functions, including performing coroners' and lunacy inquisitions, and performing civil marriages.  Until 1869 justices served both as judges of the county court and as individual justices; since then they have had only the latter function.</p>
<p><title render="bold">Locality History:  </title> Greensville County was named either for Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene, commanding general of the Continental army in the South during part of the Revolutionary War, or for Sir Richard Grenville, leader of the Roanoke Island settlement of 1585. The county was formed from Brunswick County on 28 November 1780.</p>
