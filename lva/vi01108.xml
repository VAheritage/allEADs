      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>John Coalter was born 20 August 1769 in the part of Augusta
         County, Virginia, which is now Rockbridge County, Virginia. He
         attended Liberty Hall Academy (now Washington and Lee
         University). He became tutor to the children of St. George
         Tucker (1752-1827) and studied law. He returned to Augusta
         County where he practiced law. Coalter was appointed sheriff
         in 1791 and clerk of the District Court in 1793. He was
         appointed judge of the Circuit Superior Court of Law in 1809,
         and a judge of the Court of Appeals in 1811, serving until
         1831. Coalter was a member of the Virginia Constitutional
         Convention of 1829-1830. He married first Maria Rind (d. 1791)
         in 1790; second, Margaret Davenport (d. 1796) in 1795; third,
         Anne Frances Bland Tucker (1779-1813) 5 June 1802; and fourth
         Hannah Harrison Jones (1786-1856) 14 February 1822. He had at
         least three children by his third wife. Coalter died 2
         February 1838 at Chatham, his estate in Stafford County,
         Virginia. He was buried in St. George's Church cemetery in
         Fredericksburg, Virginia.</p>
      <p>St. George Tucker was born 29 June 1752 (O.S.) in Port
         Royal, Bermuda. He emigrated to Virginia in his late teens and
         entered the College of William and Mary. Tucker graduated in
         1772, entered the bar, and began practicing law in
         Williamsburg, Virginia. During the American Revolution, he
         served with distinction at the battle of Guilford Court House
         and at the siege of Yorktown. Tucker returned to his law
         practice and in 1788 was appointed as a judge of the General
         Court of Virginia. In 1800, he was appointed a professor of
         law at William and Mary. Tucker was appointed to the Virginia
         Supreme Court of Appeals in 1803 and served until he resigned
         in 1811. President James Madison (1751-1836) appointed Tucker
         to the Federal District Court for the District of Virginia in
         1813 and he served until he resigned for reasons of health in
         1827. Tucker married first, Frances Bland Randolph (d. 1788),
         the widow of John Randolph of Matoax in Chesterfield County,
         Virginia. He became the step-father of John Randolph of
         Roanoke (1773-1833). Tucker and his wife had three children
         including Henry St. George Tucker (1780-1848) and Nathaniel
         Beverley Tucker (1784-1851). After the death of his first
         wife, Tucker married Lelia Skipwith Carter (d. 1837) 19
         October 1791. Tucker died 10 November 1827 in Nelson County,
         Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Letters, 1802-1819, between the Coalter and Tucker
         families, consisting mainly of the correspondence between St.
         George Tucker (1752-1827) of Williamsburg, Virginia, and his
         son-in-law John Coalter (1769- 1838) of Richmond, Virginia.
         Most of the letters between the two contains family and social
         news. Tucker discusses the Richmond Theater fire of 1811,
         mentions a biographical sketch he may write about Thomas
         Nelson, Jr., (1738-1789), comments on the illness of Judith
         Randolph (1772-1816) and the need for her to write a will,
         asks Coalter to pass some legal information to William Wirt
         (1772-1834), sends books on the law and on the statutes of the
         state and asks Coalter not to loan them out, and remarks on
         the steamboat service between Hampton and Norfolk, Virginia.
         Also contains two letters from Coalter to his mother-in-law
         from his second marriage, Frances Davenport (d. 1816)
         containing family and social news. Also a letter from Henry
         St. George Tucker (1780-1848) to Coalter concerning the
         possibility of Coalter's remarrying and family news. Contains
         letters from Lelia Tucker, one to Coalter as an enclosure and
         a second to an unknown recipient regarding family and social
         news, and mentioning the death of Mrs. Greenhow. Also a letter
         from "Betsy" to her mother from Williamsburg about her trip
         from Richmond, an invitation to a ball and fox hunt given by a
         Mr. Harris, and other social news from Williamsburg and
         Charles City County, Virginia.</p>
