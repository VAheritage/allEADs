      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History: </emph>King and Queen County was named for William III and Mary II, who were called to the English throne in 1688. It was formed from New Kent County in 1691.The county seat is King and Queen Court House. 
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Lost Locality Notes:</emph> Created in 1691. Records were lost in courthouse fires in 1828 and 1833. Records were again destroyed by a courthouse fire set by Union troops on March 10, 1864 during the Civil War.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>King and Queen County Chancery Causes, 1804-1913, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.

These causes are generally selected based upon guiding principles of having historical, genealogical or sensational significance; however, determining what is "of interest" is subjective, and the individual perspective and experience of the describing archivist will affect the material identified.</title></p>

          <unittitle>1885-002: Lucy Wilson, etc. vs Comt. of Andrew L. Moore, etc.
</unittitle>
        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>Lucy Wilson and the other plaintiffs were African American descendants of Edmund Littlepage, a white enslaver and Sophia, an enslaved woman. Littlepage died in 1813, leaving an inheritance to Lucie, the daughter he had Sophia. The plaintifs were descendants of the said Lucie and were making a claim on the inheritance. The white descendants of Littlepage challenged the plaintiffs' claim to the inheritance. The cause includes substantial genealogical information.
