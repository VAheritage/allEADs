      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
      <p>King William County was named for William III and was formed from King and Queen County in 1701.  Its area is 285.7 square miles, and the county seat is King William.
</p>
<p>Most records were destroyed by a courthouse fire on 17 January 1885. Only a few order books and deed books exist.</p>
    </bioghist>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>King William County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1868-1913, are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
      <p>Chancery cases are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.

          <p>The local town council election is proven to have been fraudulent for various reasons; The judges of the election left the election room during the voting, votes were cast while some of the judges were missing from the room, the tally that the judges returned was incorrect because many of the votes were made by people that were not residents of the town and two non-residents nor citizens intimidated voters into voting for a specific candidate during the voting.

</unittitle>
        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>Washington, an African American slave owned by William Robinson and later his son Benjamin Robinson, purchased property with his own earnings in 1859, but Benjamin Robinson secured the deed in his own name. Washington lived on this land essentially as a free man, keeping his wages and anything else that he earned. In January 1873, Benjamin Robinson deeded the property away as a lien for a debt then died unexpectedly in December. Washington brought this suit to the county court in an effort to prevent his land from being sold out from under him. The case took 10 years to settle and went all the way up to the Supreme Court of appeals, and it was ultimately decided that in 1859 George was a slave and had no civil rights and was therefore incapable of entering into any type of contract with anyone. The final decrees in the case show that the land was sold to someone other than George.
