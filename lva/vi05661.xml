<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>In 1784 the General Assembly authorized the sculpting of a statue of George Washington. At Thomas Jefferson's urging, Jean Houdon of Paris was hired for the work. Before Houdon came to the United States in 1785 to measure Washington for the statue, he insisted that the state purchase an insurance policy on his life for the travel abroad. During this time, Jefferson ordered a plaster model of the capitol building, which was constructed in Paris by Charles-Louis Clérisseau.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This series documents several of Jefferson's endeavors in France, primarily the purchase of weapons, the commissioning of Washington's statue, as well as the creation of the plaster model of the capitol building. These records contain accounts, correspondence, receipts, and vouchers. The accounts contain the names of persons to whom payments were made, the amounts, and the dates paid. Each receipt contains the date, the amount received, and the reason for the payment. The vouchers include the names of persons to whom money was owed, the amounts, and the dates the vouchers were submitted. Included in the correspondence are letters from Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, Charles-Louis Clérisseau, Andre[w] Limozin, John Pendleton, and Thomas Barclay, and the business partners St. Victour and Bettinger.
