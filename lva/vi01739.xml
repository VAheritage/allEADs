<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Leon Maurice Bazile was born 9 September 1890 in Hanover County, Virginia to Aime Maurice Bazile (1848-1928) and Josephine Fox Bazile (1858-1926). He attended Hanover County public and private schools and Richmond College, from where he earned his LLB in 1910. Bazile practiced law in Richmond, Virginia, until 1916, when he became assistant attorney-general for Virginia. Retiring from that post in 1930, he returned to private practice. In 1935, he was elected to represent Hanover and King William Counties in the Virginia House of Delegates. He served in the House until appointed judge of 15th judicial circuit court from 1941 until his retirement in 1965. Bazile was also a historian of Hanover County and active in education. He married Virginia Hamilton Bowcock (1889-1970) of Alabama 26 January 1918, and they had one daughter. Bazile died 18 March 1967 at his home "Retirement" in Hanover County and was buried in the family plot.
