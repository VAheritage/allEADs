      <head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
      <p>In 1970, the Governor's Management Commission Study recommended the creation of six "Deputy Governors" to assist the Chief Executive in his managerial duties. Compatible functions of government were grouped under these administrative heads, who would serve as the Governor's top management team or "secretariats" as they are called now. Currently there are 8 secretariats in state government, which are: the Secretary of Administration; Secretary of Commerce and Trade; Secretary of Education; Secretary of Finance; Secretary of Health and Human Resources; Secretary of Natural Resources; Secretary of Public Safety; Secretary of Transportation.
</p>
      <p> The secretariat responsible for human services, health and welfare has gone through several reorganizations. In 1972, the General Assembly passed an act establishing the Secretary of Human Affairs. This office was responsible for management and direction of health and human services provided by the state for the citizens of the commonwealth. In 1976, the secretariat's name changed to the Secretary of Human Resources. With reorganization of state government, the secretariat name changed again to the Secretary of Health and Human Resources in 1988. The Secretary of Health and Human Resources oversees state agencies which provide services to Virginians with mental retardation, mental illness, substance abuse and physical disability concerns, and provide assistance to low-income families and to the aging community. Additionally, the agencies also license health practitioners and ensure safe drinking water in the Commonwealth. 
</p>
      <p>During the administration of Governor Timothy Kaine, the Secretary of Health and Human Resources oversaw the following state agencies and boards: Dept. for the Aging; Dept. of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, (previously Dept. of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services); Dept. for the Blind and Vision Impaired; Dept. for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing; Dept. of Health, Dept. of Health Professions; Dept. of Medical Assistance Services; Dept. of Rehabilitation Services; Dept. of Social Services; Board for People with Disabilities; Tobacco Settlement Foundation; Office of the Comprehensive Services Act; and Virginia Foundation for Healthy Youth.
</p>
      <p>Marilyn B. Tavenner was appointed Secretary of Health and Human Resources in January 2006 by Governor Timothy M. Kaine.  Secretary Tavenner spent 25 years working for Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) first as a nurse and later as CEO for Johnston-Willis and Chippenham hospitals in Richmond, Virginia and group President of Outpatient Services. After the end of the Kaine administration, Tavenner went on to serve as Principal Deputy Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and later as Acting Administrator.

          <p>Contains incoming and outgoing constituent correspondence that was filed as part of the correspondence of the Secretary.  The filing structure of these letters is different from the structure of the letters found in Series II. and Series III., thus it was kept separate.  The topics contained in the material are very similar to those found in Series II.  Why these letters were filed seperately from the general constituent correspondence is unknown.

          <p>Contains legislative packets submitted to and reviewed by the Secretary of Health and Human Resources during each General Assembly session.  Each file usually contains enrolled bill reviews, legislative action summaries, and the text of the bill.  The enrolled bill reviews and legislative action summaries contain information on affected constituents, agency analysis of the bill, and recommendations for changes, support, or rejection.  In some cases, there is limited correspondence about the bill, usually in the form of Post-It notes or email.  Also included are several folders containing legislative proposals from agencies under the purview of the Secretary of Health and Human Resources, usually grouped into one binder.  These files contain summaries of the various proposals, notes about funding, and impact statements.
</p>
        </scopecontent>
        <arrangement>
          <p>Bill files are arranged chronologically by session year and then numerically within.  Miscellaneous legislative files are arranged alphabetically.
