</head>
<p>Born about 1783, Robert Shanks emigrated with his wife Elizabeth (b. ca. 1795) from Ireland and settled in Petersburg, Virginia. A carpenter, he acquired property in Petersburg and the surrounding counties of Chesterfield, Prince George and Surry. Robert Shanks died 21 July 1871, about 2 1/2 months after Elizabeth died 12 April 1871. They had at least five children, including Robert Shanks, Jr. (d. 1849) who also speculated in land.
