         <head>Historical Information</head>
         <p>Many Virginians felt that the constitution approved in 1869
         had been forced upon them and over the next several years,
         especially after military Reconstruction ended, there was a
         movement to call a new convention. A number of acts were
         passed by the General Assembly putting the question to the
         voters, who always voted in the negative. By the turn of the
         century, however, there were other reasons behind the demand
         for a new constitution: the inadequacies of the state
         government in regulating the railroad and public utility
         companies that had become increasingly politically powerful in
         the postwar period, the expense of administering the
         government and judicial system, and the desire on the part of
         political conservatives to disenfranchise black voters. An
         enabling act was approved by the voters in May 1900 and
         elections for delegates were held in May 1901.</p>
         <p>The delegates assembled on 12 June 1901, and most of the
         preliminary work was done in committees selected to study
         specific topics. The committee reports and recommendations
         were then debated by the full convention. The new constitution
         established a poll tax as a prerequisite for voting,
         effectively disenfranchising black voters, revamped the
         judicial system and created the State Corporation Commission.
         The convention adjourned on 26 June 1902, and shortly
         thereafter proclaimed the new constitution to be in force on
         10 July 1902, without allowing voters to ratify it. This
         unorthodox procedure was approved by the governor and the
         General Assembly, as well as the state Supreme Court of
         Appeals.</p>
