<p>The research files on the 42nd, 48th, and 50th Virginia Infantry regiments include notes, transcriptions, and copies of materials from numerous archival repositories, mainly the National Archives and Library of Congress, and from collections held privately by other researchers and descendants of Confederate soldiers. Some of the sources include census records, court records, compiled service records and other military records, published works, information from various Civil War websites and message boards, maps and photographs. There are also chronologies of operations and rosters for each regiment compiled by Chapla. There is a good deal of information on John Dudley Greever (1836-1924), William McCauley (1837-1908), and Fleming Saunders (1829-1907). The research files were compiled by Chapla for his article "Quartermaster Operations in the Forty-Second Virginia Infantry Regiment," which appeared in the March 1984 issue of <title render="italic">Civil War History</title>, and later for books published for the <title render="italic">Virginia Regimental Histories Series</title>. Also included in this series is information on Jesse Spinner Burks (1823-1885), which Chapla used for a sketch written for the <title render="italic">Dictionary of Virginia Biography</title>.  Some of the folders include source citation numbers written on the left margin. There is a key to the sources contained in the files for each regiment.
