<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p><title render="bold">Context for Record Type:  </title>Sheriffs appeared in Virginia when the original shires were formed in 1634. The sheriff was "the most powerful and the best paid of any county official in colonial times." They were appointed by the governor from a list of three names submitted by the county court and the term of office was for one year until 1731, after which it was two years. The sheriff's two deputies, also known as sub (under) sheriffs, performed most of the work.</p>
<p>The sheriff originally had three functions: law enforcement, conduction of elections, and financial officer. The sheriff was responsible for services rendered in the prosecution of court cases and acted as a combination of both the commissioner of revenue and the county treasurer. Among his many duties, he collected the taxes, which were paid in tobacco, took custody thereof and paid the county expenses as directed by the court.</p>
<p>The sheriff's duties have been curtailed over the years, but they are still the major law enforcing agent in a locality.</p>
<p><title render="bold">Locality History:  </title> Greensville County was named either for Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene, commanding general of the Continental army in the South during part of the Revolutionary War, or for Sir Richard Grenville, leader of the Roanoke Island settlement of 1585. The county was formed from Brunswick County on 28 November 1780.</p>
