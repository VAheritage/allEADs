<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Prince Edward County was named in honor of Edward Augustus, a son of Prince Frederick Louis, a grandson of George II, and a younger brother of George III.  The county was formed from Amelia County in 1753.
</p>
<p>In 1865 the Virginia General Assembly passed an act for the relief of indigent soldiers and sailors of Virginia who have been disabled in military service and the widows and minor children of soldiers and sailors who have died in the service. The act required county and corporation courts of the commonwealth to make and maintain lists of indigent solidiers and sailors in their localities and to make an allowance in money or supplies to provide for the indigent soldiers or their families. Counties charged with this task levied taxes to raise funds, appointed overseers to create lists of soldiers and families and maintained reports on the money and supplies provided to eligible individuals and families.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Prince Edward County (Va.) Indigent Soldiers' Families Accounts and Orders, 1861-1864 is primarily made up of accounts of and orders for funds and supplies requested, purchased, donated, gathered and distributed to indigent soldiers' families. The accounts may include the names of soldiers, soldiers' wives and other family members making requests for provisions, along with what and how much is requested.  Also included will be the amount of money or provisions provided by those in the locality who were taxed to raise funds for the project.  Detailed accouts maintained by overseers describe the situations of the families of indigent soldiers, including what injuries the soldiers suffered, the circumstances of the wives and children and needs for clothing and other supplies as well as food.  Also included are orders to procure funds for the purchase of specific supplies or food, often with the requests from families included with the order.  The accounts, orders and requests record that requests were made and funds were ordered to be used for specific foods such as sugar, molasses, coffee and bacon and household items such as clothing and shoes.
