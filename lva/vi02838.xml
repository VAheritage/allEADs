      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Prince Edward County was named in honor of Edward Augustus, a son of Prince Frederick Louis, a grandson of George II, and a younger brother of George III.  The county was formed from Amelia County in 1753.
</p>
      <p>Throughout the Civil War, the principal responsibility for Virginia's indigent soldiers' families lay with the locality. The Virginia State Convention in 1861 gave the responsibility entirely to counties and incorporated towns and authorized whatever actions had already been taken. Acts of Assembly in 1862 and 1863 expanded the localities' powers to provide for their needy, and in 1863 some minimal state assistance was added in. At first relief was provided as money, but as the monetary system collapsed, relief was distributed in kind. Agents of the court maintained lists of eligible families, gathered goods for distribution and paid for them, and impressed supplies if necessary. Virginia was unique amongst the southern states in that it assigned the provisioning of needy families almost solely to the locality.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The Prince Edward County (Va.) Indigent Soldiers' Families Accounts and Orders, 1861-1864 is primarily made up of accounts of and orders for funds and supplies requested, purchased, donated, gathered and distributed to indigent soldiers' families. The accounts may include the names of soldiers, soldiers' wives and other family members making requests for provisions, along with what and how much is requested.  Also included will be the amount of money or provisions provided by those in the locality who were taxed to raise funds for the project.  Detailed accouts maintained by overseers describe the situations of the families of indigent soldiers, including what injuries the soldiers suffered, the circumstances of the wives and children and needs for clothing and other supplies as well as food.  Also included are orders to procure funds for the purchase of specific supplies or food, often with the requests from families included with the order.  The accounts, orders and requests record that requests were made and funds were ordered to be used for specific foods such as sugar, molasses, coffee and bacon and household items such as clothing and shoes.
