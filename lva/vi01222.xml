      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This accession contains three boxes of architectural drawings and specifications for two public buildings in Richmond, Virginia. The first, Main Street Station, was originally built for use as a railroad
station. In the 1980s, it was adaptively reused as a shopping mall. After that venture failed, the state government took over the building for use as office space. In 2000, Main Street Station was restored and
returned to its original function as a railroad station.
</p>
      <p>The second structure, Consolidated Laboratories, was constructed in 1967 and demolished in 2003. It housed many of the Commonwealth's laboratory facilities.
</p>
      <p>Box 1 contains an 84 sheet drawing set titled "The Marketplace at Main Street Station" by SWA Architects, 1983. This set contains civil, architectural, and structural drawings on paper and Mylar. Also included
in this box is a 39 sheet drawing set titled "Renovation of Main Street Station and Seaboard Building" by Dewberry and Davis, Architects, 1989. This set contains "As Built" general, site, structural, and
architectural drawings on Mylar and paper.
</p>
      <p>Box 2 contains a 123 sheet drawing set titled "Main Street Station Multimodal Transportation Center" by Harry Weese Associates, 2000. This set contains general, removal, civil-landscape, and architectural
drawings on paper. Also included in Box 2 is an eight sheet set a floor plans for Consolidated Laboratories by Hays, Seay, Mattern, and Mattern, Architects, 1969. These "As Built" drawings are Diazo prints.
</p>
      <p>Box 3 contains one volume (384 leaves) of architectural specifications by SWA Architects for the "The Marketplace at Main Street Station" project. Also included is a one volume (289 leaves) set of architectural
specifications for "The Renovation of Main Street Station and the Seaboard Building" by Dewberry and Davis.
