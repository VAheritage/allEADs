      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>Fitzhugh Lee was born 19 November 1835 at "Clermont" in Fairfax County, Virginia, to Sydney Smith Lee (1802-1869) and Ann Maria Mason Lee (1811-1898).  He attended private schools in Alexandria, Virginia, and in Maryland. Lee was appointed to the United States Military Academy in 1852, graduating in 1856.  Appointed a lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Cavalry, Lee fought in skirmishes against Indians in Texas.  In 1860, he was appointed to teach cavalry tactics at West Point, but resigned from the position and the army 16 May 1861 to enter the service of the Confederate States of America.  Lee served throughout the Civil War, rising to the rank of major-general.  After the war ended, he moved to his plantation in Stafford County, Virginia, to become a farmer for the next 20 years.  Lee served as governor of Virginia from 1886 to 1890, but lost a bid for a United States Senate seat in 1893. President Grover Cleveland appointed Lee revenue collector for the western district of Virginia in 1895 and consul-general to Cuba in 1896.  When the Spanish-American War began in 1898, Lee was appointed a major-general of volunteers.  He married Ellen Bernard Fowle 19 April 1871, and they had seven children. Fitzhugh Lee died 28 April 1905 in Washington D.C. and was buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.
