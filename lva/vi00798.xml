      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
      <p>Warren County was named for Joseph Warren, of Massachusetts, the Revolutionary patriot who sent Paul Revere and William Dawes on their famous rides and who was killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill. The county was formed from Shenandoah and Frederick Counties in 1836. The county seat is Front Royal.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Warren County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1837-1912, are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, division of enslaved people, freedom suits, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
      <p>Chancery cases are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.

          <p>Dispute over burial property. According to a deed creating a burial plot near Front Royal known as the "Old Grave-yard" recorded in 1857, it was to be used only as cemetery.

The causes include names of individuals and families buried in the "Old Grave-yard" including Isaac Trout, Dr. George Carter's heirs, Bush Keeler's heirs, Inman H. Thompson, Berryman Jones, and John Bennett, Sr. The causes reference the creation of a second cemetery known as "Prospect Hill" because no more space was available at the "Old Grave-yard." The causes include depositions with detailed testimony concerning the two cemeteries. One deponent was asked if a road currently under construction would go over any graves found in the "Old Grave-yard." His response: "I know it runs over old Mrs. Hope, I know that very well, right in the middle of it. I was there at the burying." He listed the graves of other individuals threatened by the road. It also includes a plat showing where the "Old Grave-yard" was located.
