</head>
<p>Marion Johnson Dimmock was born in Portsmouth, Virginia in 1824 and moved to Richmond in 1833. He served in the Confederate Army, attaining the rank of captain. He became one of the most prolific Virginia
architects in the period 1870-1900. Among his more prominant commissions during this period were the Confederate Memorial Chapel (1887), a hotel in Elkton, Virginia (1890), Richmond Chamber of Commerce Building
(1891-1892), Mortuary Chapel in Hollywood Cemetery (1897-1898), and an addition to the State Library Building (Dimmock &amp; Lee, 1908).

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>These seven blueprints show sections, elevations, and plans for a Romanesque Revival church located at the intersection of Fifth and Leigh Streets in Richmond, Virginia. Marion J. Dimmock typically used this
auditorium-style for his ecclesiastical designs. The design features a battlemented tower, an arcaded front entry, corner buttress with obelisk-like tower, and stone belt courses. This building was later used as
Leigh Methodist Church, but demolished some time in the latter 20th century.
