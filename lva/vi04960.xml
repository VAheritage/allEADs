<p>Moses M. Ordway was born April 11, 1843, in West Newbury, Essex County, Massachusetts, to Moses M. Ordway (1811-1893) and Irene B. Newton Ordway (1818-1884). When the Civil War began, Ordway enlisted in Company I, 40th Massachusetts Infantry on 14 August 1862 and was mustered in on 31 August 1862. He was promoted to sergeant-major 6 January 1865 and was commissioned a 2nd lieutenant 29 May 1865, however, he was not mustered into service as a lieutenant. Ordway mustered out as a sergeant-major 16 June 1865 along with the rest of the non-commissioned staff of the company. Ordway returned to Essex County and worked as a carriage trimmer. He married Sarah R. Currier (1847-1878) and they had two children. Ordway later relocated to Knox County, Maine, where he had three children with Emma M. Heath (ca. 1856-1935) before marrying her on 14 November 1892. Ordway died in Knox County 18 November 1892. He was buried in Union Cemetery in Amesbury, Essex County, Massachusetts.
