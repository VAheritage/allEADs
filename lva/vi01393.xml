If born free, reference is sometimes made to parents. If emancipated, emancipating owner, place and date of emancipation, and prior registration as a free negro are usually mentioned. Occasionally the register number is given; this number corresponds to the entry number in the register of free negroes kept by the clerk of court at the courthouse.

</p>
<p>The judgment case of Milly, Harvey, Anna, Malinda, Eliza, Randal and Franklin vs. Alley Draper (ended 1852 November) for tresspass assault and battery and false imprisonment is the final judgment of the court that the plaintiffs deserve their freedom.
</p>

</p>
<p>The list of persons delinquent for nonpayment of taxes lists the names of both white and free black individuals, the number of county levies, the number of parish levies, and the amount of tax due.
</p>
<p>The free negro certificate for the Humble family is a statement from an individual that he has always known the members of the Humble family to be of free status. The statement is certified by a justice of the
peace. On the reverse of the certification are some notations regarding the free negro registrations of other individuals including their names, ages, and a brief physical description.
</p>
