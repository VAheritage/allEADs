         <head>Biographical Information</head>
         <p>James Monroe was born on 28 April 1758 in Westmoreland
         County, Virginia, to Spence Monroe and Elizabeth Jones. A
         graduate of William and Mary College in 1776, Monroe enlisted
         as a lieutenant in the Third Virginia Regiment of the
         Continental Army. Monroe was promoted to major following the
         Battle of Trenton, and served as a colonel and aid to General
         William Alexander from 1777 to 1778. Monroe studied law under
         Governor Thomas Jefferson and was elected to the House of
         Delegates in 1782, however, he vacated his seat when he was
         appointed to the Council of State. In 1783, Monroe was chosen
         as a delegate to represent Virginia in the Confederation
         Congress which he served until 1786. He returned to the House
         of Delegates in 1787 and represented Spotsylvania County in
         the Convention of 1788 to ratify the Federal Constitution. He
         lost an election to James Madison in the First Congress, but
         was later elected to the United States Senate on 9 November
         1790 to replace the deceased William Grayson. He was reelected
         in 1791 and served in the Senate until his resignation on 27
         May 1794. President George Washington appointed Monroe
         Minister Plenipotentiary to France on 28 May 1794.</p>
         <p>Monroe became Governor of Virginia on 19 December 1799.
         During his first one-year term in office, Monroe successfully
         quelled Gabriel's Insurrection, the largest slave uprising in
         Virginia's history until that time. Monroe's governorship too
         saw the completion of the Virginia Penitentiary and the
         Manufactory of Arms. Monroe was elected to two additional
         one-year terms as governor. Following his governorship, in
         1803, Monroe was appointed by President Thomas Jefferson as
         Minister Plenipotentiary to France, and later Minister
         Plenipotentiary to England from 1803 until 1807. Monroe
         returned to the House of Delegates in 1810 and was again
         elected governor on 19 January 1811. Monroe's second stint as
         governor, however, was short-lived as he resigned following
         his appointment by President James Madison as Secretary of
         State. Simultaneously, Monroe replaced John Armstrong as
         Secretary of War from 1814 to 1815. The culmination of
         Monroe's political career occurred with his election and
         subsequent reelection as the fifth President of the United
         States from 4 March 1817 to 3 March 1825. Monroe's last
         significant public position took place when he was elected
         president of the Virginia Constitutional Convention in
         1829.</p>
         <p>Monroe married Elizabeth Kortright in 1786. They had two
         daughters, Elizabeth and Maria Hester. He died at the home of
         his youngest daughter in New York City on 4 July 1831.
         Originally interred at the Marble Cemetery, Monroe's remains
         were later reinterred twenty-five years later in Richmond's
         Hollywood Cemetery after appeals by Governor Henry A. Wise and
         the Virginia Legislature.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>James Monroe's Executive papers are organized into two
         series. Series have been designated for Chronological files
         and Subject files. The bulk of the material can be found in
         the Chronological files' series.</p>
         <p>The Chronological Files series primarily consists of
         incoming correspondence during Monroe's three one-year terms
         as governor between 19 December 1799 until 24 December 1802.
         The correspondence in this collection relates to a variety of
         topics including appointments &amp; recommendations for state
         positions; slave insurrections; the construction of the
         Virginia Penitentiary &amp; Manufactory of Arms; the Point of
         Fork Arsenal; the boundary between Tennessee &amp; Virginia;
         public improvements; resignations; extraditions; state
         expenses &amp; revenue; quarantine of vessels; elections;
         Presidential electors; and others. In addition to
         correspondence, there are resolutions from the Virginia Senate
         &amp; House of Delegates; accounts; oaths; contracts; pardons;
         proposals; receipts; election returns &amp; certificates;
         qualifications; lists; proclamations; petitions; reports;
         appointments; resignations; bonds; commissions; orders;
         proceedings; applications; opinions; and other sundry
         items.</p>
         <p>The Governor received correspondence from three main
         sources: the Federal government, Virginia State government,
         and Governors from other states. Federal government
         correspondents include Presidents John Adams &amp; Thomas
         Jefferson; John Marshall &amp; James Madison, Secretaries of
         State; Samuel Dexter, Secretary of War; and Virginia's
         delegates in Congress. President John Adams writes Governor
         Monroe on 25 Aug. 1800 concerning the cession of the Marine
         Hospital at Norfolk to the United States on condition that the
         government pays the balance due commissioners. Additionally,
         on 3 June 1802, President Thomas Jefferson writes regarding
         the resolution of Virginia to look for a proper place,
         specifically Sierra Leone, Africa, to send insurgent negroes.
         Jefferson also communicates on the subject of upheaval in the
         French West Indies (1802 Nov. 24). John Marshall, Secretary of
         State, forwards laws from the last session of Congress (1800
         Sept. N.D.). Later, James Madison writes enclosing a complaint
         by the agent of the U.S. at Jamaica of certain frauds in flour
         shipped there (1802 Jan. 2). Samuel Dexter, Secretary of War,
         acknowledges receipt of a list of land warrants issued from
         the Virginia Land Office to the officers &amp; soldiers who
         served during the Revolutionary War on Continental
         Establishment (1800 June 16). As senators from Virginia,
         Stevens Thomson Mason &amp; Wilson Cary Nicholas write the
         Governor regarding an attempt to repeal the Sedition Law, the
         closing of the contract with Robert McCormick for the delivery
         of arms to Virginia, and the inspection of the arms by John
         Shee of Philadelphia (1800 April 29). In another letter, Mason
         encloses the bonds of John Shee and Robert McCormick (1800 May
         15).</p>
         <p>The majority of correspondence in James Monroe's Executive
         Papers originates from Virginia State government. Significant
         correspondents from Virginia State government include John
         Clarke, Superintendent of Public Buildings; Martin Mims,
         Keeper of the Penitentiary; Archibald Blair, Clerk of the
         Council; Samuel Coleman, Assistant Clerk of the Council of
         State; Philip Norborne Nicholas, Attorney General; William
         Wirt, Clerk of the House of Delegates; Humphrey Brooke, Clerk
         of the Senate; Robert Quarles, Superintendent of the Point of
         Fork Arsenal; Thomas Newton, County Lieutenant &amp;
         Superintendent of Quarantine for Norfolk; Samuel Shepard,
         Auditor of Public Accounts; and William Berkeley,
         Treasurer.</p>
         <p>Two significant building projects which began by Governor
         James Wood continued during Monroe's governorship with work on
         the Penitentiary and Manufactory of Arms. John Clarke, the
         Superintendent of these two building projects, corresponded
         frequently with the Governor. Included are the following
         subjects respecting the Penitentiary: proposals for furnishing
         lime (1800 Jan. 21); proposals for painting (1800 March 15); a
         report on the state of the public jail for the reception of
         criminals sent from the district jails (1800 March 26); an
         advance for Charles Cox as undertaker of the painting work
         (1800 April 11); the kitchen (1800 April 16); an alteration in
         Latrobe's original plan (1800 June 7 ); problems with the
         militia guard posted at the Penitentiary (1800 Oct. 15);
         carpenter's work on the Keeper's house (1800 Dec. 20);
         woodwork on the interior of the cells &amp; the removal of
         gunpowder from the Penitentiary (1801 March 28); an advance to
         John Harvie for furnishing bricks, lime, etc., for the
         Penitentiary &amp; Manufactory (1801 April 26); the purchase
         of window glass, iron, paint, etc., for the Penitentiary &amp;
         Manufactory (1801 June 20); contracts by John Harvie &amp;
         Martin Mims for furnishing bricks &amp; lime for the
         Penitentiary &amp; Manufactory (1801 Oct. 18); iron apparatus
         for cooking (1801 Nov. 28); the status of the Penitentiary
         &amp; Manufactory (1801 Dec. 4); an alteration to the
         Penitentiary so that it can be easily cleansed for the health
         of the convicts (1802 May 8); the employment of negroes
         confined in the Penitentiary in the yard stone-cutting (1802
         May 22); the digging of the well at the Penitentiary (1802 May
         24); the inscription over the entrance to the Penitentiary
         (1802 Aug. 7); the removal of gunpowder from the Capitol to
         the Penitentiary (1802 Nov. 27); and lime furnished by John
         Harvie (1802 Nov. 27).</p>
         <p>John Clarke also devoted substantial correspondence to the
         construction, employment, and materials for the Manufactory of
         Arms. On 30 May 1801, Clarke writes Monroe regarding a trip
         north to locate artificers to work in the Manufactory. In his
         absence, he names William McKim as supervisor. Subsequently,
         on 12 June 1801, Clarke writes concerning the number of
         workmen to be employed in the Manufactory and the manner he
         proposes to conduct it after its completion. Clarke also
         provides details of the number of men required for various
         branches in the Manufactory. Similarly, in his letter dated 27
         Nov. 1801, Clarke writes concerning the precise number of
         master armorers, clerks, commissaries, &amp; machinists
         necessary for the Manufactory, along with their duties. On 23
         Dec. 1801, Clarke writes the Governor defending his conduct as
         superintendent of the Manufactory following an inquiry by the
         General Assembly. On 4 Jan. 1802, Clarke encloses an estimate
         of the expense in the completion of the Manufactory of Arms
         &amp; Penitentiary, as well as for the purchase of tools.
         Lastly, on 21 Aug. 1802, Clarke informs the Governor of the

         March 15) and the calling out a proportion of the militia of
         Henrico, Chesterfield, &amp; Richmond (1800 Sept. 6). Also,

         as Clerk of the Council during his absence. Samuel Coleman, as
         Assistant Clerk to the Council, both sent and received letters
         from Governor Monroe. Monroe informed the Council on several
         occasions of his temporary absence from office (1800 March 5,

         <p>Attorney General Robert Brooke died in office on 27
         February 1800. Edmund Randolph assisted the Governor with
         opinions during Brooke's absence with illness and until a
         replacement was appointed. On 8 January 1800, Governor Monroe
         requests Randolph's opinion on the legality of trying slaves
         brought from Maryland into Southampton where they murdered
         their masters. Randolph's letter in reply on the same date
         indicates that these slaves were properly tried since they
         were not in the Commonwealth for the 12-month period required
         by the law of December 1792. Randolph also served as counsel
         for the Commonwealth in its negotiations with Robert Pollard
         concerning payment for arms furnished by him (1800 Feb. 8).
         Lastly, Randolph informs the Governor of the suit in the

         (1800 June 5). Philip Norborne Nicholas was appointed Attorney
         General on 15 March 1800. In a letter dated 6 June 1800,
         Nicholas encloses a letter from David Robertson, County
         Attorney for the District of Brunswick, regarding a fine

         <p>The Subject Files series contains subject files separated
         from Governor Monroe's Executive Papers related to three
         topics: Gabriel's Insurrection, the McCormick-Miles-Haslett
         Arms Contract, and Receipts for Pamphlets. Note that documents
         related to these subjects may still been found in the
         Chronological files. These files were originally separated to
         provide a ready-reference to researchers.</p>
         <p>Gabriel's Insurrection was the most significant historical
         event during James Monroe's time in office. Included are court
         records, trials, condemnations, confessions, pardons,
         proceedings, and correspondence regarding the slaves involved
         in the conspiracy &amp; insurrection led by Gabriel, the
         property of Thomas Prosser of Henrico County. Significant
         documents include: a letter from James McClurg, Mayor of
         Richmond, re. an intended insurrection (1800 Sept. 1); a
         letter from Joseph Jones warning of an intended rebellion of
         slaves, free negroes, and mulattoes (1800 Sept. 8); a
         resolution of the Common Hall of Richmond by Adam Craig re. an
         intended insurrection (1800 Sept. 9); Adam Craig, aid-de-camp
         to the Governor, requesting a temporary exemption from guard
         duty (1800 Sept. 13); a letter from Thomas Newton re. the
         capture of Gabriel on board the Schooner Mary and the conduct
         of its master, Richardson Taylor (1800 Sept. 24); a letter
         from Richard E. Lee, re. the arrival &amp; apprehension of
         Gabriel in Norfolk (1800 Sept. 25); a letter from James Monroe
         to the Council re. the delivery of Gabriel to the Penitentiary
         (1800 Sept. 28); minutes of the Council re. the confession of
         Gabriel and advice that extra guard be dismissed (1800 Sept.
         28); a letter from William Wilkinson re. an apprehended
         insurrection and the ordering up of part of the militia at
         Suffolk (1800 Oct. 1); and a letter from Thomas Newton re.
         accounts of an insurrection at Norfolk (1800 Dec. 29).</p>
         <p>The McCormick-Miles-Haslett Arms Contract consists of
         correspondence, receipts, bills of lading, contracts, bonds,
         and other documents related to the contract between Robert
         McCormick &amp; Company of Philadelphia, Pa., and the
         Commonwealth of Virginia for 4,000 muskets. McCormick sold his
         arms factory in May 1801 to John Miles who took over and
         completed the contract in 1803. General John Shee served as
         agent for the State of Virginia. Much of the correspondence,
         bills of lading, and receipts were sent by Shee in
         Philadelphia to Samuel Coleman in Richmond. There are also
         receipts from James Haslett, the superintendent of McCormick's
         works who continued employment when the factory was sold to
         John Miles.</p>
         <p>Lastly, the Receipts for Pamphlets, are simply receipts
         from individuals who delivered documents from the Governor.
         The receipts provide the name of the recipient, the county,
         and the amount of miles traveled. In April 1800, Governor
         Monroe arranged for the delivery of reports of a select
         committee of the House of Delegates with copies of answers of
         several states to a resolution of the General Assembly of 21
         December 1798 on the United States Alien &amp; Sedition Laws.
         Other receipts document the delivery of dispatches to militia
         commanders and letters to Commissioners for Equalizing the
         Land Tax between August &amp; September 1800.</p>
