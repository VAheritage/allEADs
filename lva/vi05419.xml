</head>
<p>Alexander Washington Edwards was born about 1835 in Princess Anne County, Virginia.  He enlisted in Company C, 15th Virginia Cavalry, 27 March 1862 and was elected 2nd lieutenant.  Edwards was captured by Union troops during the battle of Fredericksburg and was paroled.  He returned to his company and was promoted to 1st lieutenant on 5 January 1863 and eventually commanded his company.  Edwards was captured 11 May 1864 at the battle of Yellow Tavern and was sent to the prison camp at Point Lookout, Maryland.  By July 1864 he was transferred to Fort Delaware, and became part of the group of Confederate officers known as the "Immortal 600" that was sent to South Carolina and Georgia and placed in line of Confederate fire in retaliation for Union officers put in a position of receiving friendly fire.  In March 1865, those prisoners were returned to Fort Delaware.  Edwards died 11 March 1865 en route to Fort Delaware.  On 26 March 1857 he married Ann Virginia Brock.  Ann Virginia Brock Edwards was born 7 January 1834 in Princess Anne County.  The couple had no children.  By 1886, Ann Virginia Brock Edwards had moved to Norfolk, Virginia.  She applied for a widow's pension in 1903.  Ann Virginia Edwards died 1 March 1904 and was buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Norfolk.
