         <p>Manakin Iron Works was located in the town of Manakin in
         Goochland County, Virginia. The iron works began operation in
         1844 and was originally owned by Benjamin J. DuVal and
         Company. The iron works was purchased in 1846 by Stephen O.
         DuVal after Benjamin J. DuVal and Company went out of
         business. It produced nails and boiler plate bar iron and
         conducted business in Richmond, Virginia. In September 1846,
         the iron works had 24 nail machines capable of producing 150
         kegs of nails per day. It ceased operation in 1855.</p>
         <p>Goochland County was formed in 1728 from Henrico
         County.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>Manakin Iron Works Ledgers, Daybooks, and Account Book, 1847-1851, include two
         daybooks, two ledgers, and an account book.</p>
         <p>Daybook, April 1847-July 1848, records the Manakin Iron
         Works' transactions in Richmond, Virginia, as they occurred on
         a daily basis. Volume was perhaps maintained by Groves, James,
         and Company, an agent in Richmond for the iron works.
         Information found in entries includes name of customer, date
         of transaction, items purchased, quantity of items purchased,
         cost of each item, form of payment, expenses paid, and total
         amount owed or paid. Nails were the main item sold by the iron
         works. The company's expenses include charcoal, tolls,
         advertising, hauling goods, and labor. Page numbers found in
         entries correspond with page numbers found in Ledger,
         1847-1848.</p>
         <p>Ledger, 1847-1848, records the accounts of individual
         customers and the company's controlling accounts. Each account
         lists transactions in chronological order. Information found
         in each entry includes date of transaction, style of
         transaction, form of payment, and the amount owed and paid.
         The ledger does not list the names of items purchased, rather
         it uses general terms such as "Manakin Sales" or "Sundries."
         The company's controlling accounts include cash account, sales
         account, and bills receivable account. Page numbers found in
         entries correspond with page numbers found in Daybook, April
         1847-July 1848. Volume includes an index that lists customers
         and accounts in alphabetical order.</p>
         <p>Daybook, July 1849-October 1850, records transactions
         related to the iron works as they occurred on a daily basis.
         Transactions relate to debts incurred by the iron works,
         customers of the iron works, and individuals or companies who
         acted as agents for the iron works. Information found in
         entries include date of transaction, names of individuals or
         companies involved in transaction, style of transaction, and
         amount owed or paid. Transactions involved payment for labor,
         payment to accounts, and payment of expenses. Page numbers
         found in entries correspond with page numbers found in Ledger,
         1849-1850. Numerous pages are missing because they were torn
         from volume.</p>
         <p>Ledger, 1849-1850, records the accounts of individual
         customers and the company's controlling accounts. Each account
         lists transactions in chronological order. Information found
         in each entry includes date of transaction, style of
         transaction, form of payment, and the amount owed and paid.
         The ledger lists the names of individuals or companies the
         customer transacted with or a general term such as
         "Merchandise" or "Sundries." The company's controlling
         accounts include cash account and merchandise account. Page
         numbers found in entries correspond with page numbers found in
         Daybook, July 1849-October 1850. Volume includes an index that
         lists customers and accounts in alphabetical order.</p>
         <p>Account book, 1845-1851, records accounts of companies and
         individuals that the iron works purchased coal from and the
         accounts of companies and individuals the iron works sold iron
         and nails to. Each account lists transactions in chronological
         order. Information found in entries related to coal received
         includes date of transaction, number of loads, and amount of
         coal received. Information found in entries related to nails
         and iron delivered includes date of transaction, to whom sold,
         to whom delivered, name of person or ship that delivered
         items, and number of kegs of nails or bars of iron
         delivered.</p>
         <p>The last few pages of the Account Book, 1845-1851, include
         copies of three letters written in 1846 by the owner of the
         iron works, Stephen O. DuVal. In the first letter, DuVal
         informs a customer of his purchase of the Manakin Iron Works.
         In the second, he encourages a prospective partner to inspect
         the iron works. In the third, DuVal explains to a customer
         that the amount of debt the customer claimed the previous
         owners of the iron works owed him was incorrect and that Duval
         was not liable for it.</p>
