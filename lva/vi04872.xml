<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The General Assembly passed an act regulating the inspection of tobacco during its session begun in October 1777.  Inspectors were nominated by county courts and commissioned by the governor.  They inspected and graded tobacco, weighed hogsheads, and maintained record of the movement of tobacco in and out of public warehouses.  Owners of tobacco were entitled to reimbursement for property destroyed in ware house fires upon certification by the inspectors.  Periodic reports were made by inspectors to the auditor of public accounts.</p>

<p>During its session begun in October 1776 the General Assembly passed an act authorizing the county courts to appoint inspectors to examine barrels of flour prior to sale.  Subsequent acts made the inspection system more elaborate: inspectors weighed each barrel and stamped it with the place of inspection, the quality of the flour, and the name of the miller.  Periodic reports were made first to the treasurer and later to the auditor of public accounts.</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Tobacco and Flour Inspector records, 1776-1878, including inspectors' returns, tobacco manifests, affidavits, and correspondence. </p>

<p>The records are arranged into XX series. This collection consists of several Auditor of Public Accounts (APA) accessions that while identified separately, all pertain to the same collection of records. Since the specific APA accessions had been used and referenced over the years it was decided that each series would reference it's specific APA number, but one finding aid would describe the entire collection.</p>

<p>The bulk of the records fall under General Records (APA 296) and are arranged in four series. Series I: Inspectors' Returns, XX-XX, are arranged alphabetically by warehouse name into xx boxes. Included are receipts, returns and vouchers. </p>
