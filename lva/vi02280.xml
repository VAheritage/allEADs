<processinfo>
<head>Processing Information
</head>
<p>Lancaster County was processed in three separate batches. The first batch was completed in 1994. Additional records were later found at the Library of Virginia and processed in 2008. The final batch was completed in 2012 after an additional accession was transferred to the Library of Virginia from the Lancaster County Circuit Court. Each successive batch of processed records was indexed and filed at the end of the series rather than interfiled.</p>
<p>Digital images were generated by Crowley Micrographics in 2007 through the Library of Virginia's Circuit Court Records Preservation Program.
</p>
<p>Additional records transferred to the Library of Virginia in 2012 were digitized by Backstage Library Works in 2013 through the Library of Virginia's Circuit Court Records Preservation Program</p>
<p>Item previously cataloged as "Lancaster County (Va.) Will of Archibald Hinton, 1854" under accession number 23476d has been interfiled in the cause 1856-012: Admr. of Archibald Hinton etc. vs. John Robbins etc. by J. Taylor; 2023.</p>

      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph>
 Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories. 
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph>
 Lancaster County was named probably for the English county. It was formed from Northumberland and York Counties sometime between 26 March and 16 September 1651. The county court first met on 1 January 1652. The county seat is Lancaster.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Lancaster County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1722-1936, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.

<p><title render="italic">Causes of Interest are identified by local records archivists during processing and indexing. These causes are generally selected based upon guiding principles of having historical, genealogical or sensational significance; however, determining what is âof interestâ is subjective, and the individual perspective and experience of the describing archivist will affect the material identified.</title> </p>

          <p>The plaintiffs in this consolidated suit wanted the court's assistance to divide the vast real and personal property of the deceased brothers James and William Kelley. Both were also partners in a mercantile business located in Kilmarnock. They left a vast inheritance to the Protestant Episcopal Theological Seminary and Protestant Episcopal High School near Alexandria, Virginia and to the Protestant Episcopal Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society. The brothers jointly and separately enslaved people to work on their plantations, Richland and Lynums. The brothers, in their wills, emanipated all the people they had enslaved and left them funds, on the condition the newly freed people use the money for their transportation to Liberia. Jerry and Armistead, two of the enslaved men, chose to be re-enslaved rather than move to Liberia.
