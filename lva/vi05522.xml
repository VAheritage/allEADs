</head>
     

<p>The Dept. of Juvenile Justice was created as the Dept. of Youth and Family Services on 1 July 1990 (Code of Virginia 66-1). Previously, the department operated as the Division of Youth and Family Services within the Department of Corrections. The named changed to the Dept. of Juvenile Justice in 1996. The Dept. of Juvenile Justice is headed by a Director who answers to the Governor. The department also operates under the heading of the Secretary of Public Safety.</p>

<p>The mission of the Dept. of Juvenile Justice is to "protect the public through a balanced approach of accountability and comprehensive services that prevent and reduce delinquency through partnerships with families, schools, communities, law enforcement, and others, while providing opportunities for delinquent youth to become responsible and productive citizens."
The Dept. of Juvenile Justice operates the commonwealth's juvenile detention facilities, oversees delinquency, gang, and substance abuse programs, as well as group and transitional homes. Initiatives supported by the Dept. of Juvenile Justice include detention assessment and the Youth Assessment and Screening Instrument, the Detention Re-entry Project, the Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative, and the Ombudsman Program to assist families of incarcerated youth.</p>

<p>The State Board of Youth Services was also created in 1989 (Code of Virginia, 66-4) and consists of seven members appointed by the Governor. The Board meets five times each year at locations around the state. The name changed to the Board of Youth and Family Services in 1990, and the Board was renamed the Board of Juvenile Justice in 1996. Title 66 of the Code went into effect on 1 July 1990, though the Board was formed and began meeting in July 1989.</p>

<p>The Board of Juvenile Justice was created to ensure the development and implementation of a long-range youth services policy. The Board advises the Governor, the Director of the Department of Juvenile Justice, and the General Assembly on matters related to youth services. The Board of Juvenile Justice is a policy board, and is charged by law with adopting and monitoring regulations and policies for juvenile justice programs. The Board works closely with the Department of Juvenile Justice to develop new policies and review existing policies ones.</p>

<p>As part of a reorganization of the executive branch of state govenment, the Dept. of Correctional Education was eliminated by the General Assembly (SB 678) effective July 2012. The bill divided the provision and administration of education in correctional institutions between the Dept. of Corrections and the Dept. of Juvenile Justice, with suprevision by a newly created Division of Correctional Education within the Dept. of Juvenile Justice.</p>
