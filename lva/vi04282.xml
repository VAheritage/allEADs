      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Virginia Christian was convicted of murder and sentenced to death 1912 May 15, and executed in Richmond 1912 Aug. 16. She was the first woman executed by the Commonwealth of Virginia after the General Assembly centralized executions at the Virginia State Penitentiary in 1908.</p>
      <p> Elizabeth City County (extinct) was named for Elizabeth, daughter of James I, and was one of the eight shires established in 1634. It became extinct in 1952, when it was incorporated into the city of Hampton, which was the county seat. Isle of Wight County was most likely named for the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England. It was first known as Warrosquyoake and was one of the eight shires established in 1634. The present name was given in 1637. Part of Nansemond County was added in 1769.</p>
      <p>Hampton takes its name from Hampton Creek, earlier called Southampton River in honor of the earl of Southampton, an important figure in the Virginia Company of London. An Indian village stood on the site in 1607, when John Smith visited the area. The English established a village there in 1610 and a trading post in 1630. Hampton was established by an act of assembly in 1680 and was designated as a port in 1708. It was first incorporated as a town in 1849, then incorporated again in 1852, but the act of incorporation was repealed in 1860. The General Assembly again incorporated the town of Hampton in 1887, and it became a city by court order in 1908. It was greatly enlarged in 1952 by a merger with Elizabeth City County and the town of Phoebus; the county and town thereby became extinct.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Elizabeth City County (Va.) Coroner's Report related to the death of Ida V. Belote, 1912 Mar. 30, contains the report submitted by Elizabeth City County Coroner, Dr. G.K. Vanderslice, on the death of Belote in her home 1912 Mar. 18.

      <p>The witnesses whose testimony was entered as evidence were Ida Belote's three daughters, including Harriet, age 13, who discovered her mother's body when she came from school; neighbors, a police officer, and other witnesses. The coroner's report concluded Belote was killed from injuries, wounds, and strangulations received at the hands of Virginia Christian, and that the death was a result of deliberate murder. Christian was a laundress who had worked for Belote. According to the testimony in the report, Belote had accused Christian of stealing a skirt.</p>
