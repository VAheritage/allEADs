      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Henry County was formed in 1776 from Pittsylvania County. This county was named for Patrick Henry, revolutionary leader and first governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
</p>
      <p>Prior to 1853, when the Commonwealth began recording vital statistics, Virginia marriages were recorded at the county or city level. Beginning in 1661, in order to be married by license, the groom was required to go before the county clerk and give bond with security that there was no lawful reason to prevent the marriage. The license, issued then by the clerk, was given to the minister who performed the service.
Written consent from a parent or guardian was needed for individuals younger than twenty-one years.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p> Henry County (Va.) Marriage Register, 1778-1849, is essentially divided into two sections. The first section covering pages 1-149, 1778-1849, records the date of the marriage bond, the names of both parties, the names of the parents or guardians present and the names of the security or witnesses in attendance. The second section covering pages 151-196, 1781-1849, records the date of the marriage, the names of both parties, the minister's name and the religious denomination of the minister.
</p>
      <p>An Index to Marriage Register, 1778-1849, is a separate volume. This typescript index contains the first and last names of both parties. It is arranged alphabetically from A-Y and in addition, lists alternate spellings of last names.

          <p>A notable marriage is found on page 105. Two free persons of color, Jeff Artis and Ann Cousins, were married in May 1834. Additional information is included on pages 151-154--noting whether the marriage took place by obtaining a license or "by publication" (also known as marriage banns.) These banns (undated and 1781-1783) were published in the parish church where the couple lived. Marriage banns constituted a legal substitute for a marriage license prior to 1848. Undated returns are found on pages 152-153 and 194. Entries on pages 195-196 include the date of the marriage license. Additional entries, similar to the volume's first section, list undated bonds as well as bonds from 1810, 1825, 1827-1828, 1830 and 1844 on pages 197-198. On page 198, there is a small list of ministers' ordination bonds and certificates from 1820, 1823 and 1825.
