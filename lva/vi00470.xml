         <p>The James River Company was chartered by an act of the
         General Assembly of January 14, 1785. The company was to
         improve the navigation of the James River from tidewater to
         the "highest practicable point." The James River and Kanawha
         Company was chartered on February 17, 1820 as the successor to
         the James River Company, with the state subscribing to 3/5 of
         the stock. With the end of the Civil War the business of the
         canals began to fall off. On March 5, 1880 the James River and
         Kanawha Company was sold to the Richmond and Alleghany Railway
         Company.</p>
         <p>Born in 1818, Edward Lorraine worked on the James River and
         Kanawha Canal for 30 years. He began as a rod man in 1842, was
         promoted to assistant engineer, and finally appointed chief
         engineer of the canal. Lorraine served in this position until
         his death from smallpox in January 1873.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>Accession 20914 is an account, 1837-1838, 1848, (7 p.)
         submitted by William Fraser, of the firm of Fraser and Pearse,
         to the James River and Kanawha Company in support of extra
         charges incurred during construction of Lock 34, Section 135,
         of the James River and Kanawha Canal. The extra charges are
         detailed and are followed by Fraser's explanation and extracts
         of correspondence between William Beckwith, principal
         assistant engineer, and the board of the company. Section 135
         is identified as the Middleton Mill Race. The item is docketed
         1848.</p>
         <p>Accession 22600 consists of photostats of certificates of
         debt, July 1, 1839, numbers 56a through 56d, in five dollar
         denomiations, signed by James Pearce, "For the Secretary." An
         act of the General Assembly passed March 23, 1839, provided
         for the issuance of such notes.</p>
         <p>Accession 23369 includes typed abstracts from company
         minutes regarding the location of the canal and the names of
         the owners of condemned property, 1835-1840, and minutes
         concerning the reopening of the canal at the close of the
         Civil War, 1865, (1 v.); and extracts from the proceedings of
         the Board of Assessors of the company, concerning condemantion
         of land in Albemarle, Amherst, Bedford, Campbell, Fluvanna,
         Goochland, Henrico, and Nelson Counties, 1836-1840, (1
         v.).</p>
         <p>Accession 36327 consists of three parts: b) five journals
         of proceedings (minute books), 1835-1842, 1859-1881, Vol.
         20-22, 25-26, two index volumes, one journal, 1848-1860; c)
         seven field books, 1839-1879, Nos. 1546, 1548-1551, 1555, one
         volume not numbered; and d) 17 maps, n.d.</p>
         <p>Accession 36327b) Included are 5 volumes of the Proceedings
         of the President and the Directors of the James River and
         Kanawha Company, 1835-1837 (Vol. 20, 335 p.), 1837-1839 (Vol.
         21, 419 p.), 1839-1842 (Vol. 22, 534 p.), 1859-1866 (Vol. 25,
         609 p.), and 1866-1881 (Vol. 26, 444 p.), 2 index volumes to
         theses minutes, and one journal (B, or Vol. 94, 638 p.),
         1848-1860. The minutes record construction data, revenue,
         wages, and report any event, that may have been of importance
         for the board's decision process. One index volume covers the
         minute books Vol. 20-26, 1835-1881; the other is an index to
         Vol. 24, 1854-1859, which itself is not included in this
         collection. The entries in journal B include expenses and
         repairs of the Canal, tolls, interest, balance sheets, and
         dividends on loans. For preservation reasons, 36327b is only
         served on microfilm (Misc. Reel 2049-2050). Indexes and
         Minutes Vol. 20-22 are available on Misc. Reel 2049; Minutes
         Vol. 25-26 and Journal B are available on Misc. Reel 2050.</p>
         <p>Accession 36327c) Field books: No. 1546, Sept. 15, 1839 (48
         p.) contains Blue Ridge Canal notes of reference to the line,
         listing mainly beginning and end of tangents, references and
         deflections. The back cover reads "Notes of survey between
         Lynchburg and North River" and the last pages contain
         calculations. No. 1548 "W.G. Turpin," 1848, was apparently
         kept by Walter G. Turpin, and contains calculations for
         various work, like benches, pits, ditches, and embankment on
         different sections of the canal, usually headed by the name of
         the contractor. The second half contains detailed listing of
         costs involved for embankments and locks needed, as well as a
         synopsis of the Estimate on the Bald Eagle Residence, surveys
         of cross section, as well as some drawings. No. 1549 is the
         "Field book of the relocation of the Blue Ridge Canal, 2nd
         division," June 23, 1847 (114 p.), containing chiefly survey
         notes organized by numbered sections. No. 1550, "Bald Eagle
         Residence," was kept by James M. Harris and contains survey
         notes, calculations, some drawings and listing of costs. No.
         15551, 1847-1849, (114 p.), also kept by James M. Harris, is
         the Estimate book for Bald Eagle Residence. No. 1555,
         1878-1879 (96 p.), "Blacksburg," contains survey notes and
         drawings for various projects, mainly dams, and several pages
         contain the names of contractors.</p>
         <p>Accession 36327d) The seventeen maps, n.d., included in
         this collection all show privately owned property, portions of
         which needed to be taken for the use of the James River and
         Kanawha Canal. Concerned were the estates of the following
         families: Cross, Fudge, Irvine, Johns, Jones, Kearnes, Mays,
         Pharr, Scott, Sivley, Skeen, Spangler, Tennant, and
         Womack.</p>
         <p>Accession 38075 is a letter, dated 18 March 1863 [1865]
         from Edward Lorraine (1818-1872), chief engineer of the James
         River and Kanawha Companyt to the company's president and
         directors, informing them of the damage to the canal caused by
         Union cavalry troops under the command of Philip Sheridan
         (1831-1888), Thomas Devin (1822-1878), George Custer
         (1839-1876), and Wesley Merritt (1834-1910). Union troops
         destroyed locks, gates, bridges, boats, and other supplies,
         and took tools, boats, and other supplies. This is a scanned
         copy and transcript of the letter.</p>
