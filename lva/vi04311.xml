</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Starting in 2023, Library of Virginia archival staff in partnership with the Virginia Untold Project Manager began efforts to describe records related to free and enslaved Black and multiracial people in a manner that improved the historical context of the records. In doing so, in some cases material once described within the "Free and Enslaved" record group for a locality may no longer be described within this record. When this has occurred, please see the Processing Information and Related Materials section for records that have been described separately.</emph></p>

<p>Deeds of Emancipation were removed from this record in October 2024 and are now described in Lynchburg (Va.) Deeds of Emancipation, </p>
<p>Petitions to Remain were removed from this in October 2024 and are now described in Lynchburg (Va.)  Petitions to Remain in the Commonwealth, </p>
<p>"Free Negro" Registrations, affidavits and certificates were removed from this record in October 2024 and are now described in Lynchburg (Va.) Records related to the Registration of Free Persons, 1801-1864.</p>

 <p><emph render="underline">Free and Enslaved Records</emph></p>

 <p>The Free and Enslaved Records collection is comprised of miscellaneous records related to the regulation and policing of both enslaved and free Black and Multiracial people in Orange County. The localities/local government authorities were largely responsible for enforcing laws that restricted the movement of enslaved and free Black and multiracial people and the resulting documentation was often filed in the circuit courts. The ways in which local authorities enacted legal measures against or on behalf of enslaved and free Black and multiracial people varied from locality to locality; therefore, records were not necessarily standardized or filed and retained in a consistent manner. This collection is topical and a means by which to compile miscellaneous documents related to free and enslaved people that are not established local government record types.</p>

 <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Lynchburg, in Campbell County, was named for John Lynch, the owner of the original town site. It was established in 1786, was incorporated as a town in 1805, and became a city in 1852. Parts of Campbell and Bedford Counties were annexed to the city in 1976.</p>
