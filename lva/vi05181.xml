      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories. 
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Carroll County was named for Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence from Maryland. It was formed from Grayson County in 1842, and part of Patrick County was added in 1856. The county seat is Hillsville.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Carroll County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1842-1912, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.  
</p>
      <p>Chancery causes that ended before 1865, as well as some that ended afterwards, may contain information related to enslaved Black and multiracial individuals. However, these cases largely represent the perspective of white enslavers and their disputes involving the sale, hiring, financial responsibilities, and legality of ownership of Black individuals. Under the system of chattel slavery, laws permitted enslavers to treat enslaved people as personal possessions in the same manner as livestock, farm equipment, or household items.</p>
      <p>Several suits involve various members of the Allen family, who were involved in the Hillsville Massacre that occurred on March 14, 1912. Additionally, there are a number of divorce suits between 1866 and 1877 in which the plaintiffs, who fought in the Civil War, accused their wives of adultery while they were away.

          <p>The American Colonization Society (ACS) alleged that Edward Marshall, the sheriff of Carroll County, covertly withheld a tax bill with the intent of forcing delinquency and the sale of property ultimately purchased by him. The land in question had been owned by Edward Coles, a Virginian and former governor of Illinois, who had been on the ACS board of directors and was a longtime antislavery proponent. His will bequeathed a large tract of land in Carroll County, among other assets, to the ACS so the organization could sell it and use the proceeds to further its colonization efforts.
