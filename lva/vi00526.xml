<head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
<p>For many years, The Library of Virginia had no
definitive home. Valuable early records were kept at
Jamestown as early as 1676 and were then moved to the
College of William and Mary for a brief period at the
century's end. By 1780, extant records were moved to the
Capitol in Richmond.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, in 1779, the Virginia General Assembly
was presented among its legislation, "A Bill for
Establishing a Public Library" drawn up by Thomas
Jefferson. The bill provided for 2000 pounds yearly to be
expended to maintain a Library in Richmond. The facility
was to be a reference library only without books being lent
for home use. Perhaps ahead of its time, the bill failed to
pass.</p>
<p>The Virginia State Library was created by an act passed
by the General Assembly on January 23, 1823, to establish a
public library with funds derived from the sale of William
W. Hening's THE STATUTES AT LARGE. From 1823 to 1828, the
Library was under the control of the governor and council.
In 1828, the General Assembly created a joint committee on
the library (located in a room in the southeastern corner
of the Capitol) to oversee its administration. Use of the
State Library was restricted to members of the state
government in a policy that continued until at least 1856.
The Secretary of the Commonwealth served ex officio as
state librarian from 1832 to 1903.</p>
<p>The growth of the State Library was somewhat erratic.
Book holdings increased from 1,313 in 1828 to 17,480 in
1856. Lack of funds and politics frequently intermingled to
slow library development. General W.H. Richardson, State
Librarian in 1852, became embroiled in an effort to remove
him "to make way for some politician of democratic
principles." At the close of Reconstruction, Dr. George
William Bagby, then State Librarian, was terminated and his
position abolished at the hands of Readjusters.</p>
<p>Eventually, on May 15, 1903, the General Assembly passed
an act that created a library board to administer the
library, authorized the deposit of public records in the
library, provided for the publication of historical records
by the library, and established a library fund for the
purchase of books and private papers. The Library Board,
which was responsible for naming the State Librarian, was
itself appointed by the Board of Education. The General
Assembly passed an act on March 29, 1944, transferring the
power to appoint the Library Board to the governor.</p>
<p>While many public records somehow survived the
Commonwealth's early years, many losses occurred due to
fires, the ravages of war and negligence. When the library
was moved, for example, in 1895 to a building separate from
the Capitol, "chutes were constructed from the upper story
of the Capitol to facilitate the delivery of books to the
wagons of the junk dealer who had bought them." The move
was poorly planned and the library's contents suffered
great loss at the hands of those very authorities assigned
to protect them.</p>
<p>The new facility quickly was found to be inadequate and
efforts were made both in 1910 and 1920 to construct a
proper building for the State Library and its collections.
Ground was broken for the current facility on December 7,
1938. At last, on December 23, 1940, the newly completed
Virginia State Library was opened to the public.</p>
<p>The Virginia State Library adopted the name, the
Virginia State Library and Archives, in early 1987 to more
adequately reflect its mission and purpose today. In July
1, 1994 the name was changed to The Library of Virginia. It
serves as a general reference and research library, as the
official repository of state archives and publications, and
as a repository of state and federal documents. It provides
assistance and advice to libraries around the state, and it
administers state and federal library funds. The Archives
and Records Division of the library administers the state
records management program, arranges and describes records
deposited in the division, and provides assistance and
advice to state and local government agencies concerning
the management of their records. Additionally, the agency
produces many publications. The most notable among those
regularly issued are the quarterly VIRGINIA CAVALCADE and
the annual accession reports of the Archives and Records
Division showing its most recent records and manuscript
acquisitions.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Information</head>
<p>This collection is comprised of reports, clippings,
correspondence related to the State Library as well as
materials related to the School Book Investigation which
included an investigation into the acquisition of materials
for the Travelling Library. The collection is arranged into
two (2) series: General Records, and School Book
Investigation.</p>
<p>Series I. General records, c. 1877-1912. Contains
correspondence, reports and newsclippings related to the
library and its activities. Included are a draft of an annual
report, an inventory of the Archives Room (date unknown) as
well as materials regarding some of the controversies that
have surrounded the library. Included here are materials
related to the loss of items in the collections (1912), the
condition of the library building (1912), and the sale of
collection materials (1895).</p>
<p>Series II. School Book Investigation, 1906-1907. Contains
correspondence, reports, newsclippings, and court transcripts
relating to the School Book Investigation. The School Book
Investigation focused on purchasing practices employed in the
acquisition of textbooks and also books for the Travelling
Library. Mr. J.P. Kennedy, State Librarian, was under
investigation in this affair, and his correspondence with
publishers is found in this series. Oversize materials may be
found in Box 2.</p>
