<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The City of Radford, in Montgomery County, was at different times known as Lovely Mount, English Ferry, Ingles's Ferry, Central Depot, and Central City. The town of Central City was established in 1885 and incorporated in 1887. Its name was changed to Radford in 1890 to honor John Blair Radford, a prominent local citizen, and it was incorporated as a city in 1892.
</p>
<p>The United Confederate Veterans were organized in New Orleans in 1899 at a meeting of the heads of various departments, divisions, and other Confederate organizations, all meeting and amalgamating into one organization, known as the United Confederate Veterans. The first reunion was held in Chattanooga, Tennessee on 3 July 1890.
</p>
<p>Gabriel Colvin Wharton was born in Culpepper County, Va., July 23, 1824. He graduated second in the Virginia Military Institute class of 1847 and became a civil engineer. He was involved in mining in Arizona before the outbreak of the war. He joined the 45th Virginia Regiment July, 1861, and was elected major. He was made colonel of the 51st Virginia Regiment in August, 1861. His first action came with Gen. John B. Floyd's Western Virginia Campaign. Defending Fort Donaldson, Wharton escaped with Floyd in February, 1862. Sent east, Wharton commanded units under generals Loring and Samuel Jones in the western part of Virginia. He received his promotion to brigadier general July 8, 1863, and briefly commanded the Valley District. During the winter and spring of 1863-64, Wharton served with Gen. Longstreet's command in East Tennessee. He commanded a brigade at the Battle of New Market and pursued Federal forces under Gen. Hunter. His brigade fought with Gen. Early's Shenandoah Campaign and subsequent attacks into Maryland and Washington, D.C. His command was soundly defeated at Waynesboro in March of 1865. Paroled at Lynchburg, Va., June 21, 1865, he resided in Radford, Va., for the remainder of his life. Several times elected to the state senate, Wharton spent much of his time developing mining in Virginia. He died May 12, 1906.
