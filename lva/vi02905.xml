      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Chancery causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
      <p>Rockbridge County was named for Natural Bridge, an exceptional rock formation located in the county. The county was formed from Augusta and Botetourt Counties in 1778, and another part of Botetourt was added in 1888.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Rockbridge County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1781-1931 (bulk 1792-1912), are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
      <p>Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The cause concerns the settlement of the estate of Hugh Adams and his wish that his slaves be emancipated, his estate sold, and the proceeds used to transport the emancipated slaves to Liberia. Other smaller bequests in his will were for various family members.

A letter to Adams from one his former slaves living in Liberia used as an exhibit.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>A dispute between two sects of the Presbyterian church that met in the same building: Timber Ridge Presbyterian Church â the oldest Presbyterian church in Rockbridge County. Built in 1756. The plaintiffs were members of the Associate Reformed Church â a sect of the Presbyterian church. They were also referred to as Seceders. The defendants were members of the "established" Presbyterian Church. Both sides presented their version of the history of the Presbyterian church going back to 1733. The established Presbyterians asserted that the ARC sect was not Presbyterian. Both sides presented their version of the founding of the Timber Ridge church in 1759 and how the ARC congregation attained use of the Timber Ridge church in 1814. Both sides presented their version of renovating Timber Ridge church (discussion of tearing down Timber Ridge) and building nearby Fairfield church.
