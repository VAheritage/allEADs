      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Princess Anne County was formed from Lower Norfolk County in 1691 and became extinct in 1963, after its consolidation with the city of Virginia Beach.  Princess Anne County was named for Anne, daughter of James II, who became queen of England in 1702.  
</p>
      <p>Prior to 1853, when the Commonwealth began recording vital statistics, Virginia marriages were recorded at the county or city level. Beginning in 1661, in order to be married by license, the groom was required to go before the county clerk and give bond with security that there was no lawful reason to prevent the marriage. The license, issued then by the clerk, was given to the minister who performed the service.
Written consent from a parent or guardian was needed for individuals younger than twenty-one years.
</p>
      <p>Until 1780, marriages could be performed only by ministers of the Established Church, who were required by law to record marriages in the parish register. In 1780, dissenting ministers (only four per county from each sect) were first permitted to perform marriage ceremonies. Ministers' returns were required by law beginning in 1780, so all marriages from that date would be of record in the county court clerk's office--thereby creating an official record. Some ministers adopted a custom of making collected returns--a list of marriages performed within a period of time such as a year or several years.
</p>
      <p>The marriage record of Princess Anne County (Va.) described in this collection was created by the County Court.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Princess Anne County (Va.) Certificates of marriage returns, 1786-1850, records the returns made by individual ministers of marriages performed within the county. The majority of returns in this volume are in the form of lists which record the date of marriage and names of both parties. However, a few returns take the form of registers which record the date of marriage, the names of both parties, the date of the marriage license and the date of the marriage ceremony.  Other registers record the names of the persons married, the date of the marriage license, the date when the marriage ceremony took place and the name of the  county clerk who issued the marriage license.  In the process of preparing and sending the returns, the name of the minister and the minister's denomination are also recorded.  There are no recorded returns for the year 1787.  On page 94 (1828), page 96 (1823) and page 126 (1843) are noted marriages between free blacks or free persons of color.
