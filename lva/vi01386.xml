      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Accomack County was named for the Accomac Indians, who lived on the Eastern Shore at the time of the first English settlement in Virginia. The word means "on-the-other-side-of-water place" or "across the water." It was one of the original eight shires, or counties, first enumerated in 1634 and spelled Accomac without the k. The county's name was changed to Northampton County in 1643. The present county was formed from Northampton about 1663. In October 1670, the General Assembly temporarily reunited Accomack and Northampton Counties as Northampton County. In November 1673, Accomack County was again separated from Northampton. In early records, the county's name was spelled many ways. In 1940 the General Assembly adopted the present spelling, Accomack. The county gained a small part of the southern end of Smith's Island from Somerset County, Maryland, in 1879, after the United States had approved boundary changes between Virginia and Maryland that had been agreed to in 1877. The county seat is Accomac.
</p>
      <p>A significant number of loose records from the 1700s suffered extreme water and pest damage. Volumes that record deeds, court orders, and wills exist.</p>
  <p>Beginning in 1778, slaveholders who brought slaves into Virginia were required to register the slaves with the county court and sign an oath agreeing not to bring slaves into the commonwealth with the intent of selling them.
</p>
      <p>An act passed by the Virginia legislature in 1803 required individuals who brought enslaved people into Virginia to register the slaves with the county court and sign an oath denying any intent to import slaves for the purpose of selling them.
</p>
    <p>In 1806, the General Assembly moved to remove the free negro population from Virginia with a law that stated that any emancipated slaves, freed after May 1, 1806, who remained in the Commonwealth more than a year, would forfeit the right to freedom and be sold by the Overseers of the Poor for the benefit of the parish. Families wishing to stay were to petition the legislature through the local county court. Beginning in 1837, freed slaves could petition the local courts for permission to remain.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Free Negro and Slave Records, 1744-1861, of Accomack County (Va.) include affidavits and certificates of non-importation (1795-1815), deeds of manumission (1783-1791, 1806, 1812-1813, 1824), orders to summon justices to consider application of free negroes to remain in the county (1851-1854), lists of free negroes and mulattoes (1802, 1804, 1805, 1813, 1851-1861), registrations of free negroes (1805, 1837, 1850-1861), a runaway slave advertisement (1758), a request to bind out a child (1744), petitions to remain in the commonwealth (1846-1854), and miscellaneous records (1793; 1799).
</p>
      <p>The affidavits and certificates contain information whereby a slaveowner swears that (s)he has not imported the slave(s) from Africa and that (s)he has not brought the slave into Virginia with the purpose of selling it. The slave(s) is sometimes named but not always and occasionally information is given as to age or birth date.
</p>
      <p>Deeds of manumission contain the name of the slaveowner, the name of the slave, the date or age at which the slave will be freed, the date the deed was written, and the date the deed was proved. The age of the slave at the time the deed was written, a surname assigned to the freed slave by the slaveowner, and the slaveowner's reason for emancipation are sometimes given.
</p>
      <p>Orders to summon justices to consider application of free negroes to remain in the county give the name of the free negro applying to remain in Accomack County and summonses the justices of the peace to court to consider the merit of the application and to give a decision.
</p>
      <p>The 1802-1861 lists of free negroes gives names of male negroes or mulattoes, female negroes or mulattoes, male children, female children, place of abode, and trade or occupation for the adult males and females. Most lists only give the names of persons over the age of twelve. The 1802 list is of free negroes owing taxes for 1801 and 1802 to Saint George's and Accomack parishes who are to be hired out to pay the tax. The list includes names only. The 1813 list is a list of free Negroes that have not paid their taxes for the years 1812-1813. The list includes names, number of tithables, and tax owed.
</p>
      <p>Registration of free negroes gives information on a single person as to the name, age, complexion, stature in feet and inches, apparent marks or scars, whether emancipated or free born, and date this information was certified by the court.
</p>
      <p>The runaway slave advertisement is a printed notice by Landon Carter of Richmond County that his slave Will has run away and gives likely companions including his sister Sarah, a brief physical and personality description, and offers a reward for his return.
</p>
      <p>The request to bind out as an apprentice child Joshua Aleworth, aged six years, by his mother Sarah Aleworth, a free negro, is dated 1744.
</p>
<p>Petitions to remain in the commonwealth often include the name of the petitioner, the circumstances of free status, and a request to remain in the county often with accompanying names of citizens who can testify to the free status or who support the request of the petitioner to remain.
</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous records include a lawyer's certificate and opinion of claim to freedom are the opinion of Thomas Evans, an attorney, as to the claim to freedom of two men George and Robert or Robin (1793). His opinion in both cases is that the men have a probable claim. Former owners are named. Other records include a receipt for the sale of George, belonging to the estate of Henry Garrett (1799); accounts of negroes hired out belonging to George Abbott (1766-1774) which may or may not belong to the estate settlement of William Taylor; affidavit related to whether Agnes and Laura are enslaved or free.
</p>
<p>List of free negroes who worked on fortifications (Civil War), undated, records the names of free negroes and number of days each worked on fortifications.</p>
