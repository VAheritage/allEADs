      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Accomack County was named for the Accomac Nation, who lived on the Eastern Shore at the time of the first English settlement in Virginia. The word means "on-the-other-side-of-water place" or "across the water." It was one of the original eight shires, or counties, first enumerated in 1634 and spelled Accomac without the k. The county's name was changed to Northampton County in 1643. The present county was formed from Northampton about 1663. In October 1670, the General Assembly temporarily reunited Accomack and Northampton Counties as Northampton County. In November 1673, Accomack County was again separated from Northampton. In early records, the county's name was spelled many ways. In 1940 the General Assembly adopted the present spelling, Accomack. The county gained a small part of the southern end of Smith's Island from Somerset County, Maryland, in 1879, after the United States had approved boundary changes between Virginia and Maryland that had been agreed to in 1877. The county seat is Accomac.
</p>
	<p>A significant number of loose records from the 1700s suffered extreme water and pest damage. Volumes that record deeds, court orders, and wills exist.</p>

	<p>Beginning  in 1778, enslavers who brought enslaved persons into Virginia were required to register the enslaved persons with the county court and sign an oath agreeing  not to bring slaves into the Commonwealth with the intent of selling them. Certificates of importation, sometimes entitled certificates of nonimportation, contain information whereby an enslaver swears that (s)he has not imported the enslaved persons from Africa and that (s)he has not brought the enslaved persons into Virginia with the purpose of selling them.
</p>
    <p>In 1806, the General Assembly moved to remove free Black persons and free persons of color from Virginia with a law that stated that all emancipated enslaved people, freed after May 1, 1806, who remained in the Commonwealth more than a year, would forfeit their right to freedom and be sold by the Overseers of the Poor for the benefit of the parish. Free people wanting to stay were to petition the General Assembly through the local county court. Beginning in 1837, emancipated people could petition the local courts for permission to remain.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p><title render="italic">Materials in the Library of Virginia’s collections contain historical terms, phrases, and images that are offensive to modern readers. These include demeaning and dehumanizing references to race, ethnicity, and nationality; enslaved or free status; physical and mental ability; religion; sex; and sexual orientation and gender identity.</title></p>

     <p>Enslaved and Free Records, 1744-1861, of Accomack County (Va.) include "Certificates of importation" (1795-1815), “Deeds of emancipation or manumission” (1783-1791, 1806, 1812-1813, 1824), "Free negroe and mulatto Tax Records" (1802, 1804, 1805, 1813, 1851-1861), 
"Free negro registrations" (1805, 1837, 1850-1861), "Orders to summon justices to consider petitions to remain in the county/commonwealth(1851-1854), "Petitions to remain in the commonwealth" (1846-1854),"Requisitions for Public Use" (undated), Request to bind out a child (1744),"Runaway slave advertisement" (1758),and Miscellaneous records (1793; 1799.

</p>
      <p>"Certificates of Importation," 1795-1815, contain information whereby an enslaver swears that (s)he has not imported the enslaved person(s) from Africa and that (s)he has not brought the enslaved person(s) into Virginia with the purpose of selling it. The enslaved person(s) is sometimes named but not always and occasionally information is given as to age or birth date.
</p>
      <p>“Deeds of emancipation or manumission,” 1783-1791, 1806, 1812-1813, 1824, contain the name of the enslaver, the name of the enslaved individual, the date or age at which the slave will be freed, the date the deed was written, and the date the deed was proved. The age of the enslaved individual at the time the deed was written, a surname assigned to the emancipated enslaved individual by the enslaver, and the enslaver's reason for emancipation are sometimes given.
</p>
      <p>"Free Negro (and Mulatto) Tax Records", 1802-1861, compiled by the commissioner of the revenue records names of free Black persons and free persons of color (adults and children), place of abode, and trade or occupation for the adult males and females. Most lists only give the names of persons over the age of twelve. The 1802 list is of persons owing taxes for 1801 and 1802 to Saint George's and Accomack parishes who are to be hired out to pay the tax. The list includes names only. The 1813 list is a list of persons that have not paid their taxes for the years 1812-1813. The list includes names, number of tithables, and tax owed.
</p>
      <p>"Free negroes registrations", 1805, 1837, 1850-1861, recorded the free person’s name, sometimes age, a brief physical description, and the circumstances of the  person’s freedom or emancipation. If born free, a reference is sometimes made to the parents.  If emancipated, emancipating enslaver, place and date of emancipation, and prior registration are usually recorded. There may also be affidavits that were  given by individuals affirming a free person’s status, as well as written descriptions of free persons. In  addition, there are registrations that are loose papers matching information found in the bound volumes of  registered “free negroes” kept in the court house.
</p>
   <p>"Orders to summon justices to consider petitions to remain in the county/commonwealth," 1851-1854, give the name of the free Black individual applying to remain in Accomack County and summonses the justices of the peace to court to consider the merit of the application and to give a decision.
</p>
      <p>"Petitions to remain in the commonwealth," 1846-1854, record the name of the petitioner, the circumstances  of free status, and a request  to remain in the county often  with accompanying  names of citizens who can testify  to the free status or who support  the request of the  petitioner  to remain. Free registrations and other supporting documents may also be included.
</p>

</p>
      <p> “Requisitions for Public Use,” undated, consists of a list of free Black persons who worked on Civil War fortifications, recording the names of free Black persons and number of days each worked on fortifications.</p>

    <p>"Runaway slave advertisement", 1758, is a printed notice by Landon Carter of Richmond County that his enslaved man, Will, has self liberated and lists likely companions including his sister Sarah, a brief physical and personality description, and offers a reward for his return.
</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous records,1766-1799, include a lawyer's certificate and opinion of claim to freedom, 1793, are the opinion of Thomas Evans, an attorney, as to the claim to freedom of two men George and Robert or Robin. His opinion in both cases is that the men have a probable claim. Former enslavers are named. Other records include a receipt for the sale, 1799, of an enslaved man George, enslaved by the estate of Henry Garrett; accounts of persons enslaved by George Abbott which have been hired out, 1766-1774, enslaved persons may or may not be enslaved by the estate settlement of William Taylor; affidavit, undated, related to whether Agnes and Laura are enslaved or free.
