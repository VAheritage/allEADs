      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>The Superior Courts of Chancery were created in 1802 to handle chancery matters initially handled by the High Court of Chancery. The state was divided into three chancery districts and cases from the counties
composing the district were tried in a fixed location within each district. The records were kept in that location. Five additional districts were created before the court was supplanted by local Circuit Superior
Courts of Law and Chancery in 1831. This court was sometimes called District Court of Chancery.
</p>
      <p>Richmond City Superior Court of Chancery included: Albemarle, Amelia, Amherst, Bedford, Brunswick, Buckingham, Campbell, Caroline, Charlotte, Chesterfield, Cumberland, Culpeper, Dinwiddie, Fauquier, Fairfax,
Fluvanna, Franklin, Goochland, Greensville, Halifax, Hanover, Henrico, Henry, King George, King William, Loudoun, Louisa, Lunenburg, Madison, Mecklenburg, Nottoway, Orange, Patrick, Pittsylvania, Powhatan, Prince
Edward, Prince William, Prince George, Spotsylvania, and Stafford Counties.
