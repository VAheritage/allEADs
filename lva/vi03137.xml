</head>
      <p>Andrew Jackson Montague was born 3 October 1862 in Campbell County, Virginia. The son of Robert Latane Montague, lieutenant governor under John Letcher, and Cordelia Eubank, Andrew graduated from Richmond College in 1882 and from the University of Virginia law school in 1885.  Montague entered private practice in Danville, Virginia, then was appointed by President Grover Cleveland as U.S. Attorney General for the Western District of Virginia in 1893.  Montague later served as Attorney General of Virginia from 1898 to 1902.  Montague defeated Republican candidate J. Hampton Hoge as governor of Virginia serving from 1902 to 1906. While in office, progressive-minded Montague promoted good roads and public schools.  An opponent of fellow Democrat and incumbent senator Thomas Martin, Montague lost his bid as senatorial candidate in 1905. Following his governorship, Montague served as dean of the Richmond College law school from 1906 to 1909, and practiced law in Richmond, Virginia, from 1909 to 1913.  Elected to the U.S. Congress in 1913, Montague served until his death on 24 January 1937 in Urbana, Virginia.  He is buried in Christ Church Cemetery in Middlesex County, Virginia.  Montague married Elizabeth Lyne Hoskins in 1889 and they had three children.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Governor Andrew J. Montague Executive papers are organized in four series. Series have been designated for Correspondence (Chronological), Correspondence (Alphabetical), Letter Books, and Personal Papers.  These papers mainly consist of incoming and outgoing correspondence during Andrew J. Montague's four-year term as governor between 1 January 1902 and 1 February 1906.  The Correspondence (Chronological) series is the most important among Montague's Executive Papers documenting the chief correspondents and issues during Montague's governorship.  The Personal Papers series is the largest and should be utilized along with the Correspondence (Chronological) series.  This series contains additional significant correspondence.  The Personal Papers series is not exclusively records of a personal nature, but contains materials in Montague's official capacity as governor. The Letter Books series contains the outgoing copies of correspondence sent by Governor Montague.  Additional earlier letter books belonging to Montague can be found in Accession 22001 of Private Papers.  Still more letter books comprising his years as governor can be found in the Library's Vault.

          <p>The Correspondence (Alphabetical) series is housed in seven archival boxes and is arranged alphabetically by folder title. This series documents subject files maintained by Governor Andrew J. Montague.  In addition to correspondence, there are reports, bills, receipts, recommendations, telegrams, lists, applications, pardons, proclamations, and other sundry items. 
</p>
          <p>The most significant material in this series relates to the Capitol Enlargement. The Capitol Enlargement files contain correspondence, bills, receipts, minutes, acts, and reports.  The correspondence includes letters to the governor from contractors, manufacturers, etc.  There is correspondence from Samuel W. Bigger, Clerk of the Legislative Committee of Restoring &amp; Repairing the State Capitol Building regarding payment of expenses for attending meetings of the Commission, payments for contracts, and applications for the position of Engineer in charge of the proposed improvements.  W.A. Chesterman, General Contractor, writes regarding progress in the improvements to the Capitol Building, sub-contractors for brickwork, roofing, painting, etc., and his contract as contractor.  D.Q. Eggleston, Secretary of the Commonwealth, writes regarding furniture needed in his new office in the new Capitol Building.  E.A. Morgan, Acting Superintendent of the Penitentiary, writes regarding convicts from the Penitentiary for digging the foundation &amp; grading.  The architectural firm of Noland &amp; Baskervill enclose bids for work on the Capitol.  John Keevan Peebles writes regarding drawings of his work as architect of the Capitol Enlargement.  John W. Richardson, Register &amp; Superintendent of the Land Office, writes regarding coal contracts, phones for the Capitol, windows, fireproofing, furniture, his office, carpeting, and radiators.  Sydnor &amp; Hundley, Inc., provide pencil sketches of furniture for the Capitol.  In addition to correspondence, there are various proposals submitted for furnishing the House &amp; Senate, providing labor &amp; material to do the work according to the plans &amp; specifications in the alterations &amp; additions.  Lastly, there is a blueprint drawing of a water cooler &amp; stand and double lockers ("W" folder).  
</p>
          <p>Applications for pardon, bills and receipts, outgoing telegrams, quarterly reports, recommendations, text books, and Thanksgiving proclamations comprise a significant portion of this series.  The applications for pardon are filed alphabetically and contain petitions, correspondence, prison records, &amp; court records.  The bills &amp; receipts are also filed alphabetically and relate to expenses of the Executive Mansion.  In addition, there is a separate folder regarding expenses for the funeral of Fitzhugh Lee.  Outgoing telegrams from Governor Montague to various individuals relate to requisitions, judges, special elections, regrets, lynchings, fugitives, rewards, and commutations.  The quarterly reports originate from the Central State Hospital and Southwestern State Hospital, along with the Newport News Quarantine Office.  Quarterly reports can also be found in the Correspondence (Chronological) Series.  The recommendations by Governor Montague concern positions on the Board of Fisheries, judgeships in the Chesterfield Court &amp; Twentieth Circuit, Quarantine Officers, &amp; the Superintendent of Public Printing.  The Text Book files include correspondence from book companies furnishing text books for Virginia schools.  These files sometimes include chapters, synopses, &amp; excerpts of text books.  Finally, the Thanksgiving proclamations are simply proclamations to hold a day of feasting and prayer from the governors of other states &amp; territories. 
</p>
<p>Of note is a census taken of the four wards of the City of Manchester, Virginia, on 4 May 1903. The census is housed in two volumes (in one box) and contain names and notes race, gender, and marriage status of each person. An Act of the General Assembly of Virginia Extra Session of 1902-1904 (p. 82, Chapt. 88) was passed 13 March 1903 approving a census to be drawn as the General Assembly believed that that last census did not fully count the inhabitants of the City of Manchester. [These volumes were found at a later date and added to the collection in 2024.]</p>

          <p>The Letter Books series is housed in six archival boxes and is arranged chronologically. This series documents outgoing letters by Governor Andrew J. Montague.  Correspondence in this series relates to applications for positions, payments, pardons, recommendations, appointments, invitations, regrets, annual passes of transportation companies (prohibited under the new Constitution), resignations, U.S. Senate candidacy against Thomas Martin, Louisiana Purchase Exposition, launching of the battleship "Virginia," and the State Central Committee.  Noteworthy correspondents include judges, commonwealth's attorneys, William A. Jones (House of Representatives), clerks of courts, colleges &amp; universities, John S. Patton (University of Virginia), Henry St. George Tucker, and Charles N. Needham (President of the Columbian University in Washington, D.C.). Some of the outgoing letters are from Montague's secretary D.A. Ritchie.  These files are arranged alphabetically by correspondent.

          <p>The Personal Papers series is housed in twenty-four archival boxes and is arranged in two subseries.  Subseries have been designated for Chronological Files &amp; Subject Files.  This series mainly consists of files transferred from a collection of Montague records donated by Elizabeth Hoskins Montague (Acc. 22001) and transferred from the Library of Virginia's Private Papers Section.  Although it's labeled "Personal Papers" much of the series documents the work of Andrew J. Montague in his official capacity as governor of Virginia between 1902 and 1906.  The correspondence in this series should be researched in conjunction with the correspondence found in the previous series.

            <p>The Chronological Files subseries is housed in twenty-one archival boxes and is arranged in chronological order, then alphabetically by correspondent with undated and unsigned files at the end of each year.  This subseries contains incoming correspondence sent to Andrew Montague during his four-year term as governor between January 1902 and January 1906.  Correspondence in this series relates to applications for positions in state government, invitations, congratulatory letters, news clippings, autograph requests, speaking/appearance requests, acceptances of positions, recommendations, financial assistance, politics, and his candidacy for the U.S. Senate.  Note that the reverse of the correspondence provides instructions as to whether the letter is to "ans[wer]" or "file."  This subseries includes many significant correspondents including J. Hoge Tyler, Joseph E. Williard (Lieutenant Governor), Carter Glass (U.S. House of Representatives), William A. Jones (U.S. House of Representatives), the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Association of the United States, the Grand Camp of Confederate Veterans, John S. Patton (Chairman of the University of Virginia), the Louisiana Purchase Exposition Commission, Charles W. Needham (President of George Washington University), William A. Anderson (Attorney General), William F. Drewry (Superintendent of Central State Hospital), J. Taylor Ellyson (Chairman of the Virginia State Democratic Committee), Robert W. Hunter (Secretary of Virginia Military Records), Fitzhugh Lee (President of the Jamestown Exposition Company), Thomas Martin (U.S. Senate), W. Nalle (Adjutant General), John Garland Pollard (future governor), William Loeb, Jr. (Secretary to President Woodrow Wilson), Elihu Root (Secretary of War), John D. Rockefeller, President Theodore Roosevelt, and Scott Shipp (Superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute).

            <p>The Subject Files subseries is housed in three archival boxes and is arranged in alphabetical order.  This subseries contains correspondence, legislation, news clippings, receipts, telegrams, voter lists, and other sundry items.  The campaign material file includes news clippings regarding Montague's failed attempt to win Thomas Martin's seat in the U.S. Senate.  In addition, this file contains a few pieces of legislation and other documents related to Martin's record as senator.  Similarly, there are numerous lists of Democratic voters arranged by county that were compiled for Montague's campaign.  Noteworthy is a published directory for Louisa County in 1905.  Especially prevalent in this subseries are files regarding clemency requests for J. Samuel McCue, the former mayor of Charlottesville who was hanged in 1905 for the murder of his wife.  These files are arranged alphabetically by correspondent and include petitions, newspaper clippings, and McCue's published petition for a rehearing in the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia.  Telegrams from Montague or D.A. Ritchie, his secretary, are also found in this subseries.  These files are arranged alphabetically, then chronologically, and include regrets and acceptances for appearances or speaking engagements, sympathy messages, and others.  Lastly, there are receipts for various expenditures kept by Montague a few years before and during his governorship.  These receipts document purchases for clothing, household goods, groceries, livery, utilities, memberships, and other items.
