      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>Philip St. George Cooke (1809-1895) was born in Loudoun County, Virginia. He graduated in 1827 from the United States Military Academy and served in the United States Army well over 50 years. He was commissioned a colonel in 1858 and a brigadier general in 1861. Cooke commanded the cavalry around Washington D.C. early in the Civil War and led a division during the Peninsular Campaign in 1862. For the remainder of the war, Cooke held various district commands and as the general superintendent for recruiting. Cooke and his wife Rachel Wilt Hertzog Cooke had 3 daughters and one son. One daughter, Flora (1837-1923), married the famous Confederate General Jeb Stuart (1833-1864). Cooke's son John R. Cooke (1833-1891) studied at Harvard in the 1850s and was commissioned a 2nd lieutenant in the 8th Infantry in 1856 and a first lieutenant in the same regiment in 1861. He resigned his commission and entered the Confederate service, rising to the rank of brigadier general. John R. Cooke became a merchant in Richmond, Virginia, after the war. He was buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.
