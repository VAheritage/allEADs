<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Diary, 25 July 1861-29 January 1865, of Ida Powell Dulany (1836-1897). At the time of writing, Dulany was running the family's Fauquier County, Virginia, plantation while her husband Henry ("Hal") Dulany (ca. 1833-
1888) performed Civil War service with the 6th Virginia Cavalry Regiment, Company A. Ida's frequent, detailed entries document nearly every aspect of life on the plantation, as well as the progress of the war.
Topics include domestic responsibilities and social encounters, increasing deprivation, news of distant battles and eyewitness reports of fighting in the neighborhood, and the vandalism and plunder of her home by
successive raiding parties of Union soldiers in the late winter of 1864. Portions of this diary were reprinted in abridged form in the book <title render="italic">Scraps of Paper</title>, by Marietta Minigerode
Andrews.
