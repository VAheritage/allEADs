      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context of Record type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories. 
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Rockingham County was named for Charles Watson-Wentworth, second marquis of Rockingham, who supported the colonies during the years before and during the Revolutionary War. The county was formed from Augusta County in 1778. The county seat is the city of Harrisonburg.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Lost Locality Notes:</emph> A courthouse fire in 1787 destroyed primarily wills and estate records. In June 1864 during the Civil War, court records (mostly volumes) were removed from the courthouse and loaded on a wagon to be taken to place of safety on or beyond the Blue Ridge. The wagon was overtaken by Union troops near Port Republic and set afire, which was put out by local citizens. Many order books, deed books, will books, and fiduciary books, however, were lost or severely damaged by the fire. The loose records that remained at the courthouse were undamaged. Pre-1865 records including deeds and wills were rerecorded following an act of assembly passed in November 1884.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Rockingham County Chancery Causes, 1781-1946, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.

<p><title render="italic">Causes of Interest are identified by local records archivists during processing and indexing. These causes are generally selected based upon guiding principles of having historical, genealogical or sensational significance; however, determining what is "of interest" is subjective, and the individual perspective and experience of the describing archivist will affect the material identified.</title></p>

</unittitle>
        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>The case revolves around the relationship between the Methodist Episcopal Church and slavery. During the years leading up to the Civil War, the church was divided on the issue of slavery, leading to a division into two sects: the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church South. This case in particular focuses on which sect (the northern anti-slavery or the southern pro-slavery) had the right to use the church in Harrisonburg. The suit provides a detailed background on the creation of the Methodist Episcopal Church South and numerous depositions discuss the split.

          <p>Most of the Whitesel family resided in Indiana, but Peter Whitesel, the father, and Simon Whitesel, one of his sons, were living in Rockingham County. Simon convinced his father that his existing will at the time of the Civil War would be confiscated by the Confederate government because the Confederates viewed his family as alien enemies and would take over his estate. He convinced Peter to hand over the rights to all his estate to him by promising he would divide it equally after the war. Simon insisted that his father did intend for him to have the bulk of the estate, as he was the one who cared for him in his decline.
