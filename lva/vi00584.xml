<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The Anthonys were a prominent family in Bedford and Campbell Counties, Virginia. John Anthony (1746-1822) entered the Baptist ministry in 1776 and established the Otter Church, later renamed Bethlehem Church, in Bedford County, serving its congregation until his death. One son, Charles Anthony (1793-1884), became a successful farmer in Campbell County, establishing his home "Walnut Hill" on the Otter River. Both John and Charles Anthony are buried there. Another son, Abner Anthony (1790-1884), followed his father into the ministry. He served the Staunton Church and rode circuit to other churches in Bedford, Franklin, and Pittsylvania Counties. Abner Anthony established his family home, "Cedar Hill," in Bedford County. He and his wife, Almira Anthony (1820-1893), had nine children, two of whom, Charles Lewis Anthony (1837-1922) and Penn Anthony (1861-1952), continued the tradition of their father and grandfather by becoming Baptist ministers.
