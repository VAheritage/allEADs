</head>
<p>Starting in 2023, Library of Virginia archival staff in partnership with the Virginia Untold Project Manager began efforts to describe records related to free and enslaved Black and multiracial people in a manner that improved the historical context of the records. In doing so, in some cases material once described within the "Free and Enslaved" record group for a locality may no longer be described within this record. When this has occurred, please see the Processing Information and Related Materials section for records that have been described separately.</p>

</p>

<p>The Free and Enslaved Records collection is comprised of miscellaneous records related to the regulation and policing of both enslaved and free Black and Multiracial people in Orange County. The localities/local government authorities were largely responsible for enforcing laws that restricted the movement of enslaved and free Black and multiracial people and the resulting documentation was often filed in the circuit courts. The ways in which local authorities enacted legal measures against or on behalf of enslaved and free Black and multiracial people varied from locality to locality; therefore, records were not necessarily standardized or filed and retained in a consistent manner. This collection is topical and a means by which to compile miscellaneous documents related to free and enslaved people that are not established local government record types.</p>

<p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Southampton County was named, in the opinion of many authorities, for Henry Wriothesley, third earl of Southampton and treasurer of the London Company from 1620 to 1624. It is more likely, however, that the county was named for the borough of Southampton in England. </p>

<p>"Free Negro Tax Lists," 1791-1860, are lists Black and multiracial individuals compiled by a revenue commissioner for tax purposes. Lists may contain name only; they may also include gender, age, place of residence, and occupation. Lists of individuals who haven't paid taxes sometimes contain amount of tax levied, and remarks about why the tax was not paid. Theses records contain lists from Nottoway Parish, 1801 and 1817, 1821, 1822 and 1826 [oversize]; St. Luke's Parish, 1801, 1803, 1812 [oversize], and 1819; the District of Samuel Calvert, 1804-1805; the District of Ephraim Lee, 1807; a list dated 1821 Sep 6, and a list dated 1831 Dec.</p>

<p>Patrol Records, 1754-1861, undated, consist of one box of patrol reports, appointments, orders, and warrants. These patrols generally acted as the policing force that monitored the movement of free and enslaved Black and multiracial individuals. These record the names of the individuals on patrol; who authorized their patrol; dates of patrol; the number of hours on patrol; general geographic area patrolled; and compensation awarded. Some returns specifically note the objective to "apprehend all slaves and other disorderly persons," or "to visit all negro quarters, and other places suspected of entertaining unlawful assemblies of servants, slaves, or of disorderly persons."</p>
<p>"Runaway" records, 1798 and 1852, consists of a commit order, 1798, committing Robert, a Black man enslaved by Joel Judkins of North Carolina, to jail for suspicion of self-emancipating; and a jailor's report, 1852, concerning  Dennis Sycamore, a Black man, stating his legal status is free  but has been charged with self-emancipating. </p>
<p>Additional records of various record types, 1798-1852, consist of a bond, 1814, for James Jones under condition of allowing Joice, Esther, Harry, Jenny, Annah, and Mary currently enslaved by Jones to petition for their freedom at the next court. </p>
<p>Also includes, a certificate, 1824, of good character made on behalf of Stepney, a formerly enslaved Black man [possibly made in effort to petition to remain in the commonwealth, petition noted as rejected].</p>
