         <head>Biographical Information</head>
         <p>Francis Walker Gilmer was born 9 October 1790 at "Pen Park"
         in Albemarle County, Virginia, to George Gilmer (1742-1795)
         and Lucy Walker Gilmer (1751-1800). He received some of his
         education at Monticello from Martha Jefferson Randolph
         (1772-1836) and at a school run by James Ogilvie (1760-1820).
         Gilmer attended the College of William and Mary in 1809-1810,
         then studied law under William Wirt (1772-1834) in Richmond,
         Virginia. Upon the completion of his legal studies, he
         travelled extensively along the eastern seaboard with the Abbe
         Joseph Francisco Correa de Serra (1750-1823) before beginning
         the practice of law in Winchester, Virginia, in 1816. A year
         later, Gilmer returned to Richmond to continue practicing law.
         In 1824, he was chosen by Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) to
         travel to Europe to hire professors for the newly established
         University of Virginia. Gilmer himself was appointed professor
         of law, but he died before he could assume his position on 25
         February 1826 at "Farmington" in Albemarle County.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>Letters, 1818-1827, from Francis Walker Gilmer (1790-1826)
         of Richmond, Virginia, to John Randolph (1773-1833) of Roanoke
         in Charlotte County, Virginia, discussing politics, social
         news, Gilmer's legal career, and personal news. Gilmer
         comments on Spencer Roane (1762-1822) as a potential
         presidential candidate in 1824; the failure of Thomas Ritchie
         (1778-1854) to publish a letter from Randolph in the Richmond
         ENQUIRER; the Virginia-Kentucky commission to settle land
         claims between the two states; Preston's default and petition
         before the general assembly, and other political news. Gilmer
         comments on the scandal surrounding Mrs. Bell; the Virginia
         springs; Littleton Waller Tazewell's speeches; William
         Pinkney's skills as a lawyer; and other social news. He
         comments on a dispute with John Pickering (1777-1846) about
         the etymology of the word "tote." Gilmer writes Randolph about
         his trip to Europe to recruit professors for the soon-to-open
         University of Virginia, and his travels in England and
         Scotland. Gilmer writes upon his return how the trip adversely
         affected his health and comments how the university is poor
         shape because of Thomas Jefferson. Also includes a letter, 26
         January 1827, from Peachy R. Gilmer (1779-1836) to Randolph
         returning some letter to Randolph and stating that Gilmer had
         seen Randolph's niece Elizabeth Coalter (Bryan)
         (1805-1856).</p>
