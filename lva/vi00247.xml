      <p>Charles Doe was born 4 April 1830 in Derry, New Hampshire,
         to Joseph Doe and Mary Ricker Doe. He graduated from Dartmouth
         in 1849 and was admitted to the New Hampshire bar in January
         1852. Doe served as the solicitor for Strafford County, New
         Hampshire and as assistant clerk for the New Hampshire Senate
         from 1853 to 1854. In 1859 he was appointed an associate judge
         on the New Hampshire Supreme Judicial Court and served until
         it was disbanded in 1874. The next two years he returned to
         private practice. In 1876, Doe was appointed chief justice of
         the newly created New Hampshire Supreme Court and served until
         his death. He married Edith Haven 11 April 1865. Doe died in
         Rollinsford, New Hampshire, 9 March 1896.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Letter, 22 February 1850, from Charles Doe (1830-1896),
         visiting his brother Thomas (b. ca. 1820) and family in
         Danville, Virginia, to Eben Ricker Doe of Boston,
         Massachusetts, commenting on Thomas's family including the
         arrival of a new child. He states that Thomas's daughters are
         musically inclined. Doe describes a slave funeral which he
         notes as being solemn and respectful and states that slaves
         seldom request a white minister but rely on black preachers
         for the service. He also describes slave auctions in Danville
         and how slaves fear being sold south. Doe comments that he
         believes blacks held in slavery in the United States are more
         fortunate and better off than free Africans. Doe attended a
         black church service and remarks that blacks are much better
         singers than whites. He also notes that the banjo is the
         musical instrument played most often by blacks and whites.</p>
