      <head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
      <p>In 1970, the Governor's Management Commission Study recommended the creation of six "Deputy Governors" assist the Chief Executive in his managerial duties, compatible functions of government were grouped under these administrative heads, who would serve as the Governors top management team or "secretariats," as they are called now. The General Assembly in 1972 created six Secretariats positions initially. As government reorganized, that number fluctuated when government agencies expanded or consolidated.</p>

      <p>In 1972, the General Assembly passed an act in 1972 establishing the Secretary of Human Affairs. This office was responsible for management and direction of health and human services provided by the state for the citizens of the commonwealth. In 1976, the secretariat's name changed to the Secretary of Human Resources. With reorganization of state government, the secretariat name changed again to the Secretary of Health and Human Resources in 1988. The Secretary of Health and Human Resources oversees state agencies which provide services to Virginians with mental illness (historically including "mental retardation"), substance abuse and physical disability concerns, and provide assistance to low-income families and to the aging community. Additionally, the agencies also license health practitioners and ensure safe drinking water in the Commonwealth.</p>
      
      <p>William A. "Bill" Hazel, an orthopedic surgeon, served as Secretary of Health and Human Resources during the McDonnell Administration and was reappointed upon Governor Terry McAuliffe's arrival in 2014. Dr. Hazel attended Duke University School of Medicine and completed his orthopedic residency at the Mayo Clinic. He was a former assistant orthopedic surgeon for the Washington National Football League franchise and team physician for the D.C. United soccer team. As Secretary, Dr. Hazel oversaw twelve state agencies and boards: Assistive Technology Loan Fund Authority; Dept. for the Aging and Rehabilitative Services; Dept. of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services; Dept. for the Blind and Vision Impaired; Dept. for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing; Dept. of Health; Dept. of Health Professions; Dept. of Medical Assistance Services; Dept. of Social Services; Board for People with Disabilities; Office of Children's Services (formerly Office of the Comprehensive Services Act); and Virginia Foundation for Healthy Youth.
</p>

<p>Other staff members in the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services during the McAuliffe Administration include Deputy Secretaries Jennifer Lee and K. Joseph Flores; Special Advisors Pam Kestner, and Mike Wirth, and Policy Advisor Jodi Manz, the contributor and record creator of Series III.</p>
  
<p>Major policy concerns for the Secretary of Health and Human Resources during the McAuliffe Administration included the expansion of Medicaid in Virginia in connection with Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act of 2010), and the Governors Childrens Cabinet. Governor McAuliffe signed an Executive Order in 2014 creating a cabinet solely dedicated to the education, health, safety, and welfare of Virginias Children and youth. As a part of that effort, the Governor also signed a second Executive Order establishing the Commonwealth Council on Childhood Success. This Council was. chaired by Lt. Governor Northam and focused on improving the health, education, and well-being Virginia's youngest children. The Governor's Children's Cabinet is the Subject of Series I.</p>
