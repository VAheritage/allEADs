      <p>A law was passed by the General Assembly on January 16, 1908, amending Section 306 of the Code of Virginia. This law stipulated that the organization, armament, and discipline of the Virginia militia or volunteers shall be the same as that of the regular and volunteer armies of the United States. In addition, the infantry regiments were again reorganized to reflect a tighter geographical grouping and were reassigned their pre-1898 designations (i.e. 1st, 2nd, &amp; 4th Regiments). At this time, the first company of the Virginia Coast Artillery was formed to reinforce the regular army units in Hampton Roads. Three additional companies of Coast Artillery were organized by 1910, but the entire Coast Artillery Corps was disbanded in 1911 and not reorganized until 1916.

Below the oath is a consent form required in case the volunteer was a minor. The physical record, as certified by the examining surgeon, notes the condition of the volunteer including his sight, hearing, heart, lungs, etc. The surgeon also noted addictions to alcohol or opium. Finally, each enlistment record is signed and certified by the company commander.
