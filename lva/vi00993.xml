<p>There are no restrictions.  The Governor Timothy M. Kaine Administration Electronic Files, Email, collection is accessible on line.  Researchers are strongly urged to view the <extref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/kaine/">Kaine email web site</extref>
 for search tips, related content and project information.  Despite the Library's best efforts, we knew it was possible for restricted information to be overlooked during the processing of this collection. Thus we created a virtual "reading room agreement" by creating a secure gateway to the online collection. In order to view the Kaine emails, users must log in using a generic account that the Library created for this collection. By logging in, users are acknowledging their researcher responsibilities regarding protected materials.

<head>Processing Information
</head>

<p>The electronic files, including email, from the Governor Tim Kaine administration were transferred to the Library of Virginia on a hard drive. The files on the hard drive were loaded on the Library's secure dark archive and replicated on an off-site server. The electronic files were also loaded on to the processing server accessible to the processing archivists. All processing was done from the copied files on the processing server. Prior to processing, the Governors' Records Archivist compiled an inventory of each email PST file. The processing archivist noted the file name, name and title of box owner, date range, file size in KB and total number of email files. This information was categorized by office or cabinet secretariat. 
</p>

<p>The processing archivist reviewed email to determine: if the email was a public record with a permanent disposition and/or if it should be restricted for legal, medical or personal privacy issues. The processing archivist consulted the <extref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/kaine/retention_schedules/">office specific</extref>


 and <extref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.lva.virginia.gov/agencies/records/sched_state/index.htm">general records retention and disposition schedules</extref>
 for guidance. The processing archivist used the category function available in Microsoft Outlook to color code non-records and restricted records. Non-records/non-permanent records include: personal or private correspondence, meeting requests/scheduling meetings (including RSVPs and going to lunch), administrative files (<extref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.lva.virginia.gov/agencies/records/sched_state/GS-101.pdf">General Schedule 101, series 100302</extref>

). The processing archivist made an exception for two FOIA requests that were deemed of historic value since the requests led to policy changes. Delegate Scott Lingamfelter's FOIA requests for how much state government spent on printing led to a near ban on state publications. After Governor Tim Kaine became chairman of the Democratic National Committee in January 2009, media outlets submitted FOIA requests for his daily schedule. The Kaine administration did not provide the schedule but did release the cities to which he traveled.

<p>Series I-IV, VI-XII, and XIV-XX processed by Roger Christman; Series V processed by Ben Bromley; Series XIII processed by Claire Radcliffe
</p>

<p>Series I-VII and IX-XIII were processed manually. Each email was reviewed and appraised as open, non-record, redact, or restrict. Series VIII and XIV-XX were processed with the assistance of an artificial intelligence tool. The specific technology we used, Continuous Active Learning (CAL), was developed by Gordon V. Cormack and Maura R. Grossman. A CAL system uses algorithms to make predictions about which documents are most likely to be relevant - in this instance, which emails are most likely to be archival records that are open to the public. CAL presents its best guess to a human reviewer (Roger Christman). Based on yes or no response from the reviewer, the tool improves its understanding of which emails the reviewer wants to find. Christman and CAL continued this process until the tool no longer found any emails that were likely to be of interest (archival records).
</p>

<p>Processed copies of the email PST files were then passed on to the Library's information technology department for the technical phase of the project.

 states that governor's records of a strictly personal or private nature are not public records and do not have to be transferred to the Library of Virginia. <extref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/kaine/retention_schedules/121-001%20Office%20of%20the%20Governor.pdf">The Office of the Governor Records Retention and Disposition Schedule (Specific Schedule No. 121-100)</extref>
 further states that personal or private papers of the governor are non-records per the Virginia Public Records Act. Types of records may include but are not limited to correspondence with family or friends, personal business records and records of/from political organizations, not related to the role of the Governor or the Governor's staff. Only a small number of email messages met this definition and were removed from the collection.

<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Timothy M. Kaine was born on 26 February 1958 in St. Paul, Minnesota. He grew up in Kansas City and graduated from the University of Missouri-Columbia in 1979. While attending Harvard Law School, Kaine took a leave of absence to work with Jesuit missionaries as principal of the Institution Tecnico Loyola, a Catholic vocational school in El Progreso, Honduras. Kaine graduated from Harvard Law School in 1983 and was admitted to the Virginia Bar. Practicing law in Richmond, Virginia, as director of the McCandlish Kaine law firm, Kaine specialized in housing discrimination cases. He received recognition from the Richmond Bar Association, the National Fair Housing Association, and Lawyers for Public Justice for his work with civil rights. In addition, Kaine taught legal ethics for six years at the University of Richmond Law School.
</p>

<p>Kaine began his political career with an election to the Richmond City Council in 1994, serving as mayor from 1998 to 2001. During his four terms in the Richmond City Council, Kaine helped build new schools, encourage economic development, and implement the Project Exile Program to reduce violent crime. In 2001, Kaine ran for the Democratic Party nomination for Lieutenant Governor and won with 64,008 votes (39.66%). His opponents were Delegate Alan Diamonstein, with 50,753 votes (31.45%) and Del. Jerrauld C. Jones with 46,640 votes (28.90%). On 6 November 2001 Kaine was elected Lieutenant Governor with 925,974 votes (50.35%), defeating Republican Delegate Jay Katzen (883,886 votes, 48.86%) and Libertarian Gary Reams (28,783 votes, 1.57%). As Lieutenant Governor under Governor Mark R. Warner, Kaine supported state budget reform, education improvements, and the public broadcasting of the General Assembly. He served on the Governor's K-12 Accountability Work group, the Governor's Higher Education Summit, the Workforce Training Sub-Committee, the Secure Virginia Panel, the Citizens and Committees Sub-Committee, and chairman of the Disability Commission. In addition, Kaine worked on the Affordable Housing Preservation Action Committee, the Virginia Military Advisory Council, and the Olmstead Task Force.
</p>

<p>Kaine sought the governorship in 2005. On 8 November 2005, Kaine was elected Governor with 1,025,942 votes (51.72%) defeating Republican Attorney General Jerry Kilgore (912,327 votes, 45.99%) and Independent State Senator Russ Potts (43,953 votes, 2.22%). Tim Kaine became the 70th Governor of Virginia on 14 January 2006. 
</p>

<p>The Kaine administration was dominated by three issues: budget deficits, transportation funding and the 16 April 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech. Governor Kaine took office shortly before the beginning of the "Great Recession", the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. From 2007 to the end of his administration in January 2010, Kaine cut nearly $5 billion in state spending in order to balance the budget without raising taxes. Despite these cuts, Virginia retained its AAA bond rating and in 2008 was ranked as the best managed state in America by Governing Magazine. Virginia was also named as the most business-friendly state in America for 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 by Forbes.com.
</p>

<p>Despite several attempts, the Kaine administration was unable to find a reliable source of transportation funding. Kaine's 2006 proposal of increased taxes and fees was rejected by the Republican-controlled House of Delegates. In 2007 Kaine reached agreement with the Republican General Assembly on a compromise transportation package. It was the biggest transportation funding increase since 1986. The plan did not include a statewide tax increase but authorized borrowing up to $3 billion over ten years. It also granted taxing powers to regional authorities in Northern Virginia and Tidewater to support $500 million in bond-financed transportation projects. Success was short lived. One section of the legislation on abuser driver fees drew extensive criticism when it was discovered that the fees only applied to Virginians and not out-of-state residents. The General Assembly later repealed this provision. In early 2008 the Virginia Supreme Court ruled that unelected regional authorities could not raise taxes. In May 2008 Kaine proposed a new transportation plan that called for an increase in vehicle registration fees and the sales tax. A 2008 special session on transportation funding ended without an agreement.
</p>

<p>On 16 April 2007, Seung Hui Cho killed 32 people and injured at least 17 others before turning the gun on himself. The massacre at Virginia Tech is the deadliest shooting incident by a single gunman in United States history. At the time of the shooting, Governor Kaine had just arrived in Tokyo, Japan, for a trade mission. Kaine immediately returned to Virginia to deliver the convocation at Virginia Tech the next day. On 19 April 2007, Kaine commissioned the Virginia Tech Review Panel "to conduct an independent, thorough, and objective incident review of the tragedy at Virginia Tech and to make recommendations regarding improvements that can be made in the Commonwealth's laws, policies, procedures, systems and institutions, as well as those of other governmental entities and private providers." Kaine formalized the Tech Panel's charge in Executive Order 53 (2007) issued on 18 June 2007. Colonel Gerald Massengill, a retired Virginia State Police Superintendent, chaired the Panel. The Report of the Virginia Tech Review Panel was released on 30 August 2007. It revealed deficiencies in the mental health care system, campus security and gun laws. The Panel made more than 70 recommendations directed to colleges, universities, mental health providers, law enforcement officials, emergency service providers and law makers. The General Assembly passed legislation to reform the mental health commitment laws and campus security policies. One major recommendation by the Panel was defeated: requiring background checks for all firearms purchased at gun shows.
</p>

<p>In April 2008, the state reached an $11 million financial settlement with 24 families of students and faculty who were killed or injured during the Virginia Tech shooting. The state agreed to provide monetary pay outs, medical care and information on the shooting in exchange for the families to waive their rights to sue. Two families who filed claims against the state did not accept the settlement and filed a civil suit in 2009. The discovery of Cho's Cook Counseling Center records in July 2009 and other concerns by family members about the Panel's time line for 16 April 2007, lead to calls for the Panel to reconvene. Kaine did not reconvene the Panel but agreed to have the report revised to reflect the new details that surfaced since 2007. The amended report was released in the last month of the Kaine administration. On 12 March 2012, a jury in the civil suit found Virginia Tech negligent in failing to warn students of a possible gunman on campus. 
</p>

<p>Other significant accomplishments of the Kaine administration include: a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants, funding to clean up the Chesapeake Bay, the preservation of over 400,000 acres of open spaces, passage of a $1.6 billion bond package for higher education construction projects, expanding pre-K education, required teacher evaluations, and Renew Virginia Initiatives (energy).
</p>

<p>During his term, Governor Kaine served as chairman of the Southern Governors' Association (2008-2009) and Chairman of the Democratic National Committee (2009-2011). On 6 November 2012, Kaine was elected United States Senator with 2,010,067 votes (52.86%) defeating Republican George Allen (1,785,542 votes, 46.96%). In 2016, Kaine was the Democratic nominee for vice president of the United States as Hilliary Clinton's running mate. While the Clinton-Kaine ticket won the national popular vote, they lost the Electoral College. However, Clinton-Kaine won Virginia (1,981,473 votes, 49.7%) defeating the Republican ticket of Donald Trump and Mike Pence (1,769,433 votes, 44.4%). On 6 November 2018, Kaine was re-elected United States Senator with 1,910,370 votes (57%) defeating Republican Corey Steward (1,374,313 votes, 41%).
</p>

<p>Kaine is married to Anne Bright Holton, youngest daughter of former Governor Linwood Holton. Anne and Tim have three children, Nat, Woody, and Annella.

<p>The Executive Office is a division of the Office of the Governor in the Executive Branch of Virginia state government. Members of the Executive Office include the Governor, Chief of Staff, Counselor to the Governor and their deputies and assistants. The Governor is the Chief Executive of the Commonwealth and chief advocate for annual legislative and budget priorities. Sherrie Harrington served as Confidential Assistant to Governor Tim Kaine.
</p>

<p>The Chief of Staff is the chief operating officer of state government, responsible for all aspects of service to citizens. The Chief oversees the Cabinet members and agency heads in the administration of state government and is also responsible for the operations of the Governor's Office. The Chief is assisted in these responsibilities by a Deputy Chief of Staff and an Executive Assistant. The following individuals held these positions during Governor Timothy M. Kaine's administration (2006-2010): William H. Leighty, Chief of Staff (January 2006-May 2007); Wayne Turnage, Deputy Chief of Staff, (January 2006-May 2007) and Chief of Staff (May 2007-2010); Margaret Hughson, Executive Assistant (2006-2007); Steve Harms, Deputy Chief of Staff (June 2007-2010); and Kate Paris, Confidential Assistant to the Chief of Staff and Counselor (2007-2010).
</p>

<p>The Counselor in the Kaine administration provided legal advice to the Governor and acted as a liaison with the judiciary and the Office of the Attorney General. The Counselor also provided broader advice to the Governor on political and personal matters as assigned. The Counselor was the chief liaison with the Democratic Party, the Moving Virginia Forward PAC, and outside political constituency groups. The Counselor was assisted in these responsibilities by a Senior Advisor, a hybrid position, who provided legal assistance to the Counselor and legislative assistance to the Policy Director. The Senior Advisor was available to mediate important policy disputes for the Governor, or with the Governor's consent, for legislators and other external constituents. The following individuals held these positions during Governor Timothy M. Kaine's administration (2006-2010): Lawrence Roberts, Counselor to the Governor (January 2006-May 2009), and Mark E. Rubin, Senior Advisor to the Governor and Deputy Counselor (January 2006-May 2009) and Counselor to the Governor (May 2009-January 2010).
</p>

<p>The Leadership Team in the Office of the Governor consisted of the Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief of Staff, Counselor, Senior Advisor, Policy Director, Legislative Director, Communications Director, Scheduling Director, and Press Secretary.  This group conducted daily morning meetings in preparation for that day's events in the Governor's Office. The Governor held regular meetings with this group and in certain instances convened small subsets of the Leadership Team to address specific or more targeted issues.

<p>The Communications Office is a division of the Office of the Governor in the Executive Branch of Virginia state government. The Communications Office promotes the Governor's initiatives and priorities outside of government, as well as monitoring coverage of the Governor from outside, independent news sources. During Governor Timothy M. Kaine's administration (2002-2010), the Communications Director strategically explained the Administration's priorities to the public in a variety of media. Any statement written or otherwise attributed to the Governor had to be cleared with Communications. The Communications Director was assisted in her responsibilities by a Press Secretary, additional press staff, a web master, and a photographer. In addition, the Communications Director oversaw the work of the Constituent Services Director whose staff members promptly responded to inquiries of the pubic received via mail, phone and email. The Communications Director was also a member of the Governor's Leadership Team. Delacey Skinner (January 2006-December 2008) and Lynda Tran (January 2009-January 2010) held this position during the Kaine administration (2006-2010).
</p>

<p>The Communications Director was assisted in her responsibilities by a Press Secretary (Kevin Hall, January 2006-October 2007, and Gordon Hickey, October 2007-January 2010). Jeff Kraus served as Senior Advisor to the Governor and Speech writer from January 2006 to January 2007.

This series contains 10490 emails in seven (7) subseries. Subseries have been designated for A. Daniel LeBlanc Email; B. Gail Robinson Email; C. Brian Davis Email; D. Marietta Salyer Email; E. Beatrice Yarney Email; F. Sarah Abubaker Email; and G. Patrick Callahan Email. There are 49 privacy protected and confidential emails in this series that are restricted from public access for 75 years per Code of Virginia 42.1-78.

</p>

<p>The Workforce Investment Act (WIA), signed by President Bill Clinton in 1998, reformed federal job training programs and created a new comprehensive workforce investment system. The WIA did five things: created a state workforce investment system, created a local one stop delivery system, authorized three local workforce programs for adults, youth and dislocated workers, amended three related federal statutes (Adult Education and Literacy), (Wagner-Peyser) and (Rehabilitation Act) and authorized five national workforce programs - Job Corps, Migrant and Seasonal Farm Workers, Veterans, Native Americans and Youth Opportunity Grants.
</p>

<p>A 2002 Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission review of Virginia's implementation of WIA recommended the creation of a workforce development coordinator, reporting directly to the Governor, whose sole responsibility would be statewide coordination of workforce development services. When the General Assembly did not pass this recommendation in 2003, Governor Mark Warner, took executive action and on 17 June 2003 appointed Dr. Barbara Bolin as Special Assistant to the Governor on Workforce Development.
</p>

<p>In 2004 the General Assembly codified the position (renamed Special Advisor to the Governor for Workforce Development) and clarified the advisor's specific duties. The advisor is responsible for serving as the liaison for workforce training with state and local government, the Virginia Workforce Council (VWC), local work investment boards, as well as the general business community. The advisor is also responsible for reviewing fund allocation, helping the VWC implement policies for the Virginia Workforce System, monitoring federal workforce-related legislation, and reporting annually on the condition of statewide workforce training programs. Dr. Bolin resigned her position in May 2005, and Dolores Esser of the Virginia Employment Commission was appointed to fill the vacancy in November 2005.
</p>

<p>In 2006 General Assembly passed legislation creating the Chief Workforce Development Officer. The Governor is the Chief Workforce Development Officer and he may delegate that responsibility to a senior person on his immediate staff. The Chief Workforce Development Officer is responsible for the coordination of workforce development across Secretariats and ensuring that the Commonwealth's workforce development efforts are implemented in a coordinated and efficient manner. This position replaced the Special Advisor to the Governor for Workforce Development created in 2004.
</p>

<p>On 21 March 2006, Governor Tim Kaine named Daniel C. LeBlanc, former President of the Virginia AFL-CIO and Kaine's failed nominee for Secretary of the Commonwealth, as Senior Advisor to the Governor for Workforce. Executive Order 25 issued by Governor Kaine on 23 June 2006 delegated his authority as Chief Workforce Development Officer to the Senior Advisor to the Governor for Workforce and further clarified the Advisor's duties and responsibilities. This order was issued to ensure that initial transition steps occurred to implement the 2006 legislation. Kaine's Executive Order 61, issued on 4 January 2008, rescinded Executive Order 25 and was issued to ensure that the next phase of transition occurred including: the creation of a Workforce Sub Cabinet to ensure Cabinet collaboration regarding workforce development as required by state and federal statute; listing of the duties of the Cabinet Secretaries and designating the Virginia Community College System (VCCS) as the designated state agency for the WIA, including that of grant recipient and fiscal administrative agency. 
</p>

<p>Executive Order 61 also tasked the Senior Advisor for Workforce with overseeing the implementation of the development of comprehensive integrated seamless local One Stop workforce service delivery systems. To further advance the implementation of this effort, the State Partner Memorandum of Understanding for Comprehensive One Stop Centers was signed in March of 2008. This document was the first in Virginia to clearly delineate specific requirements of state agencies and programs across multiple Secretariats towards the creation and support a workforce development system that operates effectively in a one stop environment with a primary focus on citizens and employers in an efficient manner.
</p>

<p>With the assistance of Camille Miller, a consultant, five workforce centers were opened by the end of the Kaine administration in January 2010. An additional seven were scheduled to open by June 2010.

In this role, he coordinated with the Virginia Community College System and mandated State government representatives in order to realize the Governor's vision for workforce development.

<p>The Office of Commonwealth Preparedness collaborated with federal, state, and local officials as well as the private sector to develop a coordinated security and preparedness strategy and implementation plan. The office served as the liaison between the governor and the federal Department of Homeland Security. The duties of the office during the Kaine administration included the oversight, coordination and review of all disaster, emergency management, and terrorism management plans for the state and its agencies; served as the governor's representative on regional efforts to develop a coordinated security and preparedness strategy; served as a direct liaison between the governor's office and local governments and first responders; and educated the public on security and preparedness issues. The office also participated in several oversight groups that provided policy and guidance to the rest of the state. These groups included the Secure Commonwealth Panel, Commonwealth Preparedness Working Group (CPWG), Regional Preparedness Advisory Committees, and the Virginia Military Advisory Council. The Commonwealth Interoperability Coordinator's Office (CICO), reported directly to the Assistant for Commonwealth Preparedness and served as a direct liaison between the governor and Virginia's local governments and first responders on issues of emergency preparedness.
</p>

<p>Some of the major initiatives of the office during the administration of Governor Timothy Kaine were the National Capital Region (NCR), critical infrastructure protection, and the Virginia Higher Education Preparedness Consortium.
