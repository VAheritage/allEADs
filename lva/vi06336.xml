<head>Processing Information
</head>
<p>Digital images were generated by Backstage Library Works through the Library of Virginia's Circuit Court Records Preservation Program in 2024.
</p>
<p>Field processors completed original indexing throughout the 1990s-2000s. During reprocessing by Local Records staff, indexing was completed to Library of Virginia Standards, this required the moving of chancery causes to different years; changing styles of suit for individual causes; and combining and/or separating causes when necessary. Local Records staff also located non-chancery cases during reprocessing (including judgements and commonwealth causes) which were removed from the chancery and filed separately by record type. </p>
<p>During reprocessing, Local Records staff removed paper folders that contained notations and cross-references to information contain in volumes stored Wythe County Circuit Court house. These notes were not destroyed but are not digitized.</p>
<p>Wythe Chancery causes, 1797-1830, were processed by M. Mason and V. Brooks. Causes, 1831-1865, were processed by M. Long from March 2022 to July 2023.</p>
<p>Wythe County (Va.) Chancery Causes 1797-1865 are the first half of the chancery records for the locality to be processed. There are plans for Local Records Staff to later process the 1866-1912 records. </p>

<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.</p>
<p><emph render="bold">Types of Courts:</emph> </p>
<p>Wythe County was the site of a Superior Court of Chancery that held court in Wythe from 1812 to 1832. The Superior Courts of Chancery were created by an act of the General Assembly passed on 23 January 1802. In order to expedite the hearing of chancery suits, the High Court of Chancery was abolished and the state was divided into three chancery districts with a Superior Court of Chancery for each district. For this reason, these courts were sometimes called "District Courts of Chancery." Suits heard in these courts were typically cases appealed from the local courts. A transcript of the suit from the local court was commonly filed with the appeal. Litigants could by-pass the local courts and file their suits in the chancery district court directly. </p>
<p>From 1802 to 1812, Wythe fell into the Staunton district which consisted of localities found in the western half of the Commonwealth. In 1812, the General Assembly created additional Superior Courts of Chancery which included the Superior Court of Chancery in Wythe. The Wythe district include the counties of: Giles, Grayson, Lee, Montgomery, Russell, Scott, Tazewell, Washington, and Wythe.</p>

<p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Wythe County was named for George Wythe, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and chancellor of Virginia in 1789 when Wythe County was formed from Montgomery County. Part of Grayson County was added in 1825.</p>
</bioghist>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a">
<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Wythe County (Va.) Chancery Causes,1797-1865, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.</p>

<p> For this set of causes, debt and contract suits are the most prevalent, and mostly concern disputes stemming from land transfers. Estate disputes are the next most documented cause of action. There are very few other causes of action represented. </p>
<p><emph render="underline">Superior Chancery:</emph>
 </p>
<p>A majority of the 1812-1833 Chancery Causes are Superior Chancery cases. These causes while heard in Wythe County (Va.) additionally document the activities of individuals and businesses from Giles, Grayson, Lee, Montgomery, Russell, Scott, Tazewell, and Washington counties. Apart from Wythe County, Washington County is the locality most documented in these records. </p>
<p>Due to the prevalence of Superior Chancery, there are also variations in the causes themselves that may not fit the normal make-up of a chancery cause as there causes throughout this 1812-1833 span that have matters heard in both Superior Court of Chancery and the Superior Court of Law. General this occurred when an issue in chancery was sent by the judge to law side of the court for verdict before a final decree was entered in Chancery. </p>
<p><emph render="underline">General Trends:</emph>
 </p>
<p>There is a substantial amount of information concerning enslaved Black men, women, and children. While there are several suits concerning the freedom of enslaved individuals, these cases largely represent the perspective of white enslavers and their disputes involving the sale, hiring, financial responsibilities, and legality of ownership of Black individuals. Specifically, there are many cases concerning estate disputes which over enslaved individuals.</p>
<p>Due to the geographic area represented in these records, many suits document the land struggles is western Virginia and general western migration after the Revolutionary War. Various cases (especially pre-1833) list the Loyal Company as plaintiff. These causes discuss land surveys (in (Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio) conducted when Virginia was a colony, including conflicts with the Indigenous Americans already living on the land, the effects of the French and Indian War on property rights, conflicts with the Ohio Company, and ownership disputes post-American Revolution. In these cases, there is fairly standardized language to describe the history of the land surveys on the part of the Loyal Company.</p>
<p>Additionally on this theme of western migration, many suits include issues of defendants moving beyond the commonwealth to Tennessee, Kentucky, or Ohio, complicating matters for the plaintiffs. Many suits discuss key issues and historical trends surrounding lead and gypsum mining, including: the working and living conditions experienced by both enslaved workers hired out to the mines and workers directly employed by the mining companies, including workplace dangers and long-term health risks; business inheritance issues facing recent immigrants, especially women; and the environmental effects of lead pollution on air quality, water sources, and plants and animals in surrounding areas.</p>
<p>There are multiple pre-1830 suits concerning Almerine Marshall and his estate after dying in the 1811 Richmond Theater fire. Other individuals and family frequently presented are William and James King, King family, Trigg, family, and Heiskell family.</p>
<p>These records also contain a box of "Orphan Chancery" which is processed but not indexed. These records contain parts, often single items, of chancery causes that could not be further identified as belonging to a certain case.</p>

          <p>In this Freedom suit, Cesar [or Caesar] is seeking to secure his freedom after the death of his enslaver, James Campbell Jr., and death of Campbell's wife Mary Campbell. The terms of Campbell's will stipulated that his executors free Cesar upon the death of Mary Campbell should Cesar "in their opinion he has behaved towards her dutifully and with fidelity." Cesar argues he continued to do everything in his power to help Mary Campbell and run the estate efficiently; however, the executors turned to past disagreements between Cesar and Mary Campbell and decades old allegations to keep Cesar enslaved. The depositions primarily discuss the community perception of Cesar, and also reveals the legal counsel James Campbell received in constructing the terms of Cesar's manumission which shows the malicious intentions behind the stipulations.

          <p>Jacob Vanhooser claims legal ownership of Bob, an enslaved man, then in the hands of Jesse Evans. Vanhooser asserts that a group of "lawless bandits" took Bob during the Revolutionary War and therefore Jesse Evans cannot have a legal title. Evans argues that his understanding of events affirms that Bob came into the hands of the "board of officers" comprised of Colonel Lynch, Colonel Preston, and Colonel Wm. Campbell during the war as part of efforts to "distress rebels [loyalists]" in Southwest Virginia. Actions legitimized by the Virginia General Assembly in 1782, therefore providing Evans with a legal title to Bob. Appears the court ruled in favor of Vanhooser as there was no proof the board directed the sale of Bob.

The jury convicted Owens of suffering gambling, a game of "hustle cap", on his property while Owens argues he was not present and tried to break-up the game. Owens further claims that various errors in the proceedings resulted in the guilty verdict and the judgment for one hundred and twenty dollars. The judge rules that the Superior Court of Chancery for the Wythe District does not have jurisdiction in the matter and the case should be moved to the Superior Court of Chancery to be held in Richmond.

          <p>Debt: Samuel Jones argues that the judgement against him brought by Henry Kinder is not lawful and that Samuel was not able to defend himself in court. The dispute at the heart of the cause concerns an fight which took place between Samuel and Henry regarding a plank removed from Henry's property by a group of men enslaved by Samuel, to be used by the local blacksmith to fix a wagon for Samuel. The fight was allegedly quite violent, resulting in Henry Kinder being injured. Henry then sought a judgement for damages as a result of these injuries. Much of cause tries to determine who is at fault for the fight. Samuel's bill is ultimately dismissed.

He claimed that there were no negative health risks associated with lead exposure, and that the point was irrelevant anyway because the boarding house was only a temporary structure that housed enslaved workers hired out to the plaintiffs. Testimony in this case included extensive debate over the existence of "lead colic," a chronic lead workers disease, and specifically whether enslaved former residents of the boarding house were suffering from it. Testimony also goes into detailed descriptions of the environmental effects of the lead mine, including poisonous water and smoke in the area and the frequent deaths of nearby plants and animals.
