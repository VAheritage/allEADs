      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Chancery causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
      <p>Page County was named according to most sources, for John Page, revolutionary patriot, congressman, and governor of Virginia from 1802 to 1805. It was formed from Rockingham and Shenandoah counties in 1831.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Page County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1813-1914 (bulk 1831-1914), are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
      <p>Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.

        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>Involves issuing a Scire Facias to repeal a letter patent or grant on grounds that is was obtained by false suggestion. Plaintiff filed a Land Office Treasury Warrant for 4,790 acres prior to defendant.  George Hetick filed his Land Office Treasury Warrant for 25,517 acres and plaintiff's patent was contained within his lands. Lands in question were originally part of Shenandoah County (now Page.) According to county surveyor in an 1833 deposition, his home was burnt down and plaintiff's plat and survey were recorded in a previous surveyor's book that was in his home and was burnt in the fire. Part of defendant's claim rests on the fact that he was a lifelong resident of Pennsylvania.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>Cause involves a contract dispute but cause does not contain any contracts.  Suit 1833-007 contains all contracts mentioned. In dispute are the deeds 1823 and 1831 made between Henry Long and his step daughter, Nancy Painter and her son, Adam Painter. Plaintiff's wife was the half sister of Henry Long.  Henry Long was said to be old, infirm and a drinker but others surmise that he had fallen under the influence of his step daughter.  In a disputed matter, deeds were made by the defendants to Henry Long's sons to convey western lands-320 acres in Ohio and 160 acres in Indiana.  These lands in Ohio belonged to Henry Long and his step daughter and her son.  Henry Long's kin lived in Rockingham County, Virginia and Ohio. George Kite was said to have bought a family of negroes from Henry Long. Others say that Kite's legacy was paid in slaves by Henry Long. Defendant lived in Shenandoah and Rockingham counties.

        <scopecontent>
          <p>In his will, filed in Page County in 1831, Raphael Conn emancipated all of his 17 slaves. The court rules that his slaves may be hired out or sold to pay for his estate's debts while the legacy of his niece, Mary J. Conn, is protected-thus increasing his debts.  All of this is not lost on his enslaved as they are named defendants along with his niece to the suit.  In their answer, they fight back stating that "their liberty should be place on a higher footing than the legacy of his niece which is so far a special legacy." They ask the court to release them from their servitude.  They were instead hired out and his estate earned $185.00 However, the estate remained $600.00 in debt. Cause mentions his valuable enslaved.

          <p>Plaintiff claims that there was a verbal agreement to go to Greene County and bid in partnership with the defendants for the first 14 miles of the Rockingham Turnpike Road from Stanardsville to Harrisonburg. Plaintiff relates that the defendants refused to consider your plaintiff as one of the said firm and denied him the principle of participating in the profits of said contracts. Defendants countered saying that there was no agreement and no partnership. Plaintiff was a merchant in town of Luray. Defendants had been contractors and partners on various Public Works. Enslaved were hired to help build the road--a very arduous job considering the mountainous terrain.

          <p>Wharton Jones was a guardian, administrator of 2 estates, a commissioner who sold slaves and an executor of an estate. Jones' varied activities and the fact that he kept no written accounts placed a great burden on his administrator. The administrator had to search through immense number of papers and various records in Shenandoah and Page counties, get information from individuals in order to enable him to do justice to others and to prevent immense losses to Jones estate. All the commissions and profits of these various settlements went to the benefit of Wharton Jones' estate. Depositions give detailed information on Wharton Jones clientele as well as those of other estate administrators.  Genealogical information on Wharton Jones' heirs is also included. Heirs also reside in North Carolina and Missouri. Jones' administrator resides in Bedford County, Virginia.
