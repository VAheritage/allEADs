</head>
        <p>Much of the collection was originally arranged by the company according to an ambiguous lettering and numbering system that could not be deciphered by the processing archivist. The collection subsequently was
rearranged according to current archival standards but the numbers for the original files were retained and are written on each folder. Ute Schechter, a former archivist at The Library of Virginia, was the
original processor of this collection.

      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>The Virginia Electric and Power Company, now known as Dominion Virginia Power, comprises approximately 250 subsidiary companies which were purchased or merged into the company over its 220 year existence. For
the purposes of this description, Virginia Electric and Power Company will be shortened to its acronym and pseudonym "VEPCO." The company became known as the Virginia Electric and Power Company in 1925 when its
two principal subsidiaries, the Spotsylvania Power Company of Fredericksburg and the Virginia Railway and Power Company, merged. To facilitate description, "VEPCO" will be used to describe the company both before
and after this merger.
</p>
      <p>In 1787, the Virginia General Assembly established the Appomattox Trustees, a corporation whose original purpose was clearing, improving and extending the navigation along the Appomattox River so that rum and
tobacco might be hauled into the Virginia highlands from the Tidewater and Hampton Roads. Since the founding of this corporation, more than 250 subsidiary companies founded for various and sundry enterprises as
water power, real estate, horse shoe manufacturing, ice making, coal mining, laundry, railway and trolley service, ferry service and street lighting have joined the corporate ancestry of VEPCO. Like the Appomattox
Trustees the earliest subsidiaries of VEPCO generally organized to focus on the development of canals and water power in Virginia. By the mid-19th century, however, the arrival of passenger railways and
electricity, especially in urban areas, had displaced water travel and power as the focus of VEPCO subsidiary companies. Many VEPCO subsidiaries flourished during the late 19th and early 20th century after the
appearance of urban electrical streetcars.
</p>
      <p>On 29 June 1909, the Virginia Railway and Power Company was incorporated to acquire three of the largest rail companies in Richmond. This was the corporate birthday and the real beginning of the Virginia
Electric and Power Company. During the 1910's the company operated streetcars in four cities under complex and inflexible franchises. After World War I streetcar fares failed to adjust to meet increased cost
demand. In the early 1920's city, state and national government and courts were asked to take charge of the crisis. Ultimately the Virginia State Corporation Commission took jurisdiction over public transportation
and electrical companies, but failed to address the fare issue. As a result by the mid-1920's, streetcar and electrical companies had shifted their business pendulum to focus principally on the distribution of
electrical power. For the next three quarters of a century, this power company continued to consolidate smaller companies and increase the size of its power grid throughout Virginia and Northern North Carolina.

specific legal cases as is the case with the legal files in Subseries B. These correspondence files concern various business and legal matters brought to the attention of the general counsel by interoffice staff,
other business persons and governmental officials. At the end of this series is a folder containing correspondence, 1914-1919, in reference to articles that appeared in

            <p>Contains correspondence and legal and case files including legal briefs, generally exchanged between the General Counsel, VEPCO attorneys and claims agents in the Legal Department, VEPCO executives, opposing
counsels and litigants, other businesses and business persons, and government and court officials. Many of the cases concern personal injury, fatal error, and property lawsuits caused by accidents on or with
streetcars. Other files pertain to streetcar operation and fares. There are also legal documents including deeds and contracts concerning the purchase and transfer of property right-of-ways, property disputes, and
the development of infrastructure in Richmond and Norfolk including street paving, streetcar lines and railways, water and gas lines, and power grids. Other legal files including most notably the dense case of
Charles Hall Davis concern lawsuits in reference to stock and dividend disputes. A small amount of files also concerns deferred classification for war military service by VEPCO employees. At the end of this
subseries are case summaries and lists, 1921-1923, arranged chronologically by the company.
