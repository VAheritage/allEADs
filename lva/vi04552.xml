He earned an A.B. degree from Trinity College in Dublin, 1850, graduated from Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Virginia, 1852, and was ordained as a deacon in 1853. Over the course of his career in the ministry of the Protestant Episcopal Church, Wall served in the Diocese of Virginia, Diocese of Maryland, Diocese of Easton (Maryland), and for a time in the Diocese of Huron (Ontario, Canada). He married first, Jane Ferrar (d. 1854) in 1849, with whom he had two children; second, Judith Woodford Hansford (d. 1866) in 1856, with whom he had five children; and third, Julia Hansford in 1866.
