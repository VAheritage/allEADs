      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
      <p>Campbell County was named for William Campbell, a general in the militia during the Revolutionary War and one of the heroes of the Battle of Kings Mountain in 1780. The county was formed from Bedford County by an act passed on 15 December 1781. The county court first met on 7 February 1782.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Campbell County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1794-1914, are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.lva.lib.va.us/whatwehave/local/chancery/index.htm">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
      <p>Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.

</unittitle>
        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>The suit involved a dispute over the estate of Robert Wright, a free mulatto, who died at age 38. He owned a substantial amount of property (including slaves) in Campbell County that he inherited from his former master and father Thomas Wright. His mother was a slave of Thomas' named Sylvia. Polly Davidson was white and lived with Robert Wright as his wife. They had a child named Martha. Robert also had an infant son named Thomas from a previous relationship with a white woman named Polly Godsey. The family of Thomas Wright argued that Robert was never freed by their father; therefore, did not have legal right to the property. See also Lynchburg (Va.) Chancery Causes 1825-027 and 1873-014.
