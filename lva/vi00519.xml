      <head>Agency History</head>
      <p>On January 7, 1919, Governor Westmoreland Davis created the
         Virginia War History Commission whose goal was "to complete an
         accurate and complete history of Virginia's military, economic
         and political and civic participation in the World War." The
         commission had limited success. Its' work was hampered by a
         lack of funds and a lack of interest. Virginians wanted to
         forget about the war and get on with their lives. The
         commission did publish seven source volumes between 1923 and
         1927 but did not publish a comprehensive history.</p>
      <p>After the United States entered World War II in December
         1941, Dr. Lester Cappon, an archivist at the University of
         Virginia, proposed the creation of a state agency to preserve
         "the records of Virginia's part in the war contemporaneously
         with the production of these records." Cappon wrote Douglas S.
         Freeman, chairman of the Virginia Council of Defense, editor
         of the Richmond News Leader and a former member of the
         Virginia War History Commission, about his proposed "Committee
         on Virginia Historical Records of the Second World War."
         Cappon wanted the scope of the Virginia Council of Defense
         expanded to include the collection and preservation of war
         records. He was unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>In September 1942 the Virginia Conservation Commission's
         Division of History and Archaeology, under the direction of
         Dr. Hamilton J. Eckenrode, began a war records collection
         program. Unable to continue the Division of History's
         historical marker program because of wartime rationing,
         Eckenrode sought to "record the history of the Old Dominion's
         war effort while the history is still fresh in the making,
         rather than wait until after the war when the events and
         details would be more obscured." The Conservation Commission
         began a correspondence program in which a non-salaried
         correspondent from each locality sent reports about local war
         activities and local effects and reaction to the war. In
         October 1942 the Commission began a newspaper file. War news
         articles related to Virginia were clipped/transcribed and
         sorted by time period and subject categories. In addition, the
         Commission published VIRGINIA IN WAR TIME, 1942-1943, a short
         sketch on how the war affected Virginia.</p>
      <p>In 1943 the Virginia Conservation Commission created the
         Historical Advisory Committee of the Virginia Conservation
         Commission to assist with the war records program. Members of
         the committee included: Dr. Cappon, Dr. Eckenrode, Dr. E.G.
         Swem, William and Mary College, Dr. Wilmer Hall, Virginia
         State Librarian and State Senator William Wright, Chairman of
         the Virginia Conservation Commission. The committee met in
         January 1944 to discuss the creation of a permanent agency for
         collecting war records.</p>
      <p>The Virginia World War II History Commission was
         established by an Act of the Virginia General Assembly
         approved on 8 March 1944. The commission was a policy-making
         body comprised of twelve non-salaried citizens appointed by
         the Governor. Its purpose was "to collect, assemble, edit, and
         publish. . . information and material with respect to the
         contribution to World War II made by Virginia and Virginians."
         The commission, headed by Senator Wright, hired Dr. Cappon as
         director and Dr. W. Edwin Hemphill of Mary Washington College
         as assistant director. Staff was assigned working quarters in
         the Alderman Library of the University of Virginia.</p>
      <p>To achieve their goal of collecting records and publishing
         histories concerning Virginia's participation in the war, the
         commission devised a two-phase plan. During the planning phase
         (1944-1946), the commission publicized its activities in two
         pamphlets: Your Communities War History: What Are You Doing to
         Preserve Its Records? and Writing Your Community's War
         History. These publications encouraged communities to create
         their own local war history commission branch and offered
         suggestions and advice. During this time, the Virginia
         Conservation Commission continued the newspaper-clipping file
         and turned it over to the commission in 1946. The Virginia
         Conservation Commission assisted the commission with its'
         questionnaire, "Personal War Service Record of Virginia's
         Dead". The next of kin of Virginia's deceased servicemen
         completed the questionnaire. Dr. Cappon resigned at the end of
         1945 and Dr. Hemphill replaced him as director.</p>
      <p>During the research and writing phase (1946-1950), the
         commission hired additional staff members and began publishing
         histories. The first book, Gold Star Honor Roll of Virginians
         in the Second World War, published in 1947, was a roster of
         Virginia's 9000 war dead. Other publications published or
         assisted by the commission included: Pursuits of War: People
         of Charlottesville and Albemarle County, Virginia in the
         Second World War; Virginia's State Government During the
         Second World War: It's Constitutional, Legislative and
         Administrative Adaptations, 1942-1945; Virginia on Guard:
         Civilian Defense and the State Militia in the Second World
         War; Virginia Farmers at War: Essays on Agricultural
         Production in the Old Dominion During the Second World War;
         Conscripted City: Norfolk in World War II and Aerial Gunner
         from Virginia: the Letters of Don Moody to his Family During
         1944.</p>
      <p>The commission operated as an independent agency until 1948
         when the state government reorganization act approved by the
         General Assembly on 30 March 1948 placed it administratively
         under the Virginia State Library. After the transfer became
         effective on 1 July 1948, the commission was known as the
         World War II History Division. On 1 July 1950, as a result of
         a new reorganization of the state's historical offices, the
         World War II History Division was combined with the Division
         of History and Archaeology of the Virginia Conservation
         Commission, to become the History Division of the Virginia
         State Library. The new division ceased work on World War II
         publications.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The series Personal War Service Record of Virginias War
         Dead consists of questionnaires completed by the next-of-kin
         of Virginian's killed during World War II. The three-page
         questionnaire records personal and military data. The first
         page records personal information including the full name of
         the soldier, home address at time of enlistment, birth date
         and place, race, height, weight, name of spouse, date and
         place of marriage, name and date of birth of children,
         education, religious affiliation and name of father and
         mother. The second and third page records military information
         including, date and place of enlistment, induction or
         commission, branch of service, prior military service, where
         trained or stationed, promotions, military honors,
         circumstances of death (including date and place) and the next
         of kin. Photographs, letters, newspaper clippings and military
         service records often accompany the questionnaires.
         Information from this collection was used to compile the GOLD
         STAR HONOR ROLL OF VIRGINIANS IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR.
         However, a questionnaire does not exist for every individual
         listed in the GOLD STAR HONOR ROLL.</p>
