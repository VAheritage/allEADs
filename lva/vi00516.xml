      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Henry Tazewell was born 27 November 1753 in Brunswick
         County, Virginia, to Littleton Tazewell and Mary Gray
         Tazewell. He attended the College of William and Mary, then
         studied law under his uncle John Tazewell in Williamsburg,
         Virginia. He represented Brunswick County and then
         Williamsburg in the House of Delegates from 1776 to 1786.
         Tazewell was appointed to the General Court in 1785, and
         served as chief justice from 1789 to 1793. He then was
         appointed judge of the Virginia Court of Appeals that year.
         The Virginia General Assembly appointed Tazewell United States
         Senator in 1794 and he served until his death in Philadelphia,
         Pennsylvania, 24 January 1799. He was buried at Christ Church
         in Philadelphia. Tazewell married Dorothea Elizabeth Waller
         (1754-1777), daugher of Benjamin Waller (1716-1786), 13
         January 1774, and they had two children, Littleton Waller
         Tazewell and Sophia Ann Tazewell who married Benjamin
         Taliaferro (d. 1801) of Williamsburg.</p>
      <p>Littleton Waller Tazewell was born in Williamsburg,
         Virginia, 17 December 1774 to Henry Tazewell and Dorothea
         Elizabeth Waller. Educated by his grandfather Benjamin Waller
         and George Wythe (1726-1806), Tazewell attended the College of
         William and Mary, graduating in 1791. He studied law under
         John Wickham (1763-1839) of Richmond, Virginia, and was
         admitted to the bar in 1796. Tazewell represented James City
         County in the House of Delegates from 1798 to 1800. That year,
         he was elected to the United States House of Representatives
         and served until 1801. In 1802, Tazewell relocated to Norfolk,
         Virginia, to continue his law practice. He represented Norfolk
         in the House of Delegates from 1804 to 1806 and in 1816.
         President James Monroe appointed Tazewell a commissioner to
         settle claims under the treaty in which Spain ceded Florida to
         the United States. In 1824, Tazewell was appointed to the
         United States Senate, and he served eight years before
         resigning 16 July 1832. He served as a member of the Virginia
         Constitutional Convention of 1829- 1830. Tazewell was elected
         governor of Virginia in 1834 and served until 1836, when he
         resigned. Tazewell returned to Norfolk where he spent most of
         his time running his plantations in Northampton County,
         Virginia. Tazewell died 6 May 1860 in Norfolk, and was buried
         at King's Creek plantation in Northampton County. He was
         reinterred at Elmwood Cemetery in Norfolk.</p>
      <p>Littleton Waller Tazewell married Ann Stratton Nivison
         (1785-1859) 15 July 1802, and they had nine children: Louisa
         Nivison Tazewell (1804-1873), Henry Tazewell (1805-1828), John
         Nivison Tazewell (1807-1869), Sarah Tazewell (1809-1810),
         Sarah Ann "Sally" Tazewell (1812-1892), Littleton Waller
         Tazewell (1815-1848), Ann Elizabeth Tazewell (1817-1898), Mary
         Tazewell (1822-1886), Ella Waller Tazewell (1826-1885). Ann
         Elizabeth Tazewell married Edmund Bradford (1816-1889), Mary
         Tazewell married Matthew Page Waller (1823-1861), and
         Littleton Waller Tazewell married Sarah Elizabeth Walters (ca.

          <p>John Randolph to Littleton Waller Tazewell-was out riding when received news from Hamilton of SC about Tazewell's wife-went to Tazewell's but missed him-met with Hugh Lawson White-found Tazewell's note upon his arrival home-pleads with Tazewell not to resign seat until they can talk-Tazewell and Randolph can work well together-Barbour would've thwarted the good that Tazewell is trying to do-trust in God-talked to Van Buren and Berrian-will try to postpone the Panama Mission 'till Tazewell returns-again a plea not to resign-worst thing to happen to Virginia since Washington's death if does-if Tazewell goes, Randolph will also go
