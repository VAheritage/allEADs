      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case.
</p>
      <p>Roanoke County was named for the Roanoke River, which in turn was derived from the English colonists' misunderstanding of the Indian word for the shell beads worn as personal adornment or used for trade. The county was formed from Botetourt County in 1838, and part of Montgomery County was added in 1849. The county courthouse is in the city of Salem, and the administrative offices are in the county.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Roanoke County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1839-1912, are indexed into the <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/chancery/">Chancery Records Index</extref>. Cases are identified by style of suit consisting of plaintiff and defendant names. Surnames of others involved in a suit, including secondary plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses, deponents and affiants, and family members with surnames different from the plaintiff or defendant are indexed. Chancery causes often involved the following: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, divorces, debt, and business disputes. Predominant documents found in chancery causes include bills (plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, wills, slave records, business records or vital statistics, among other items. Plats, if present, are noted, as are wills from localities with an incomplete record of wills or localities other than the one being indexed.
</p>
      <p>Chancery cases are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history.

          <unittitle>1880-044: Fanny R. Johnston, etc. vs. Exr. of Nathaniel Burwell, etc.: 
</unittitle>
        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>Burwell was accused of selling or hiring out his wife Lucy's slaves she inherited from her father Charles Carter of Shirley Plantation for his (Burwell's) own benefit which was to buy land in Roanoke County. According to the marriage contract, any profits from sale of Lucy's slaves were to remain with her dower. There is a reference to a pamphlet written by Nimrod Hughes who claimed the world was going to end in 1812. It created quite a stir in southwest Virginia. Hughes claimed the prophecy had not entirely failed. On June 4, 1812, the United States declared war on Great Britain and Napoleon invaded Russia. The prophecy did some good. Burwell's brother testified that he became a Christian because of the prophecy. The prophecy was used to date when Nathaniel Burwell travelled to Richmond from Roanoke to get money to purchase the Dropmore estate. Fanny Johnston was the daughter of Frederick and Nancy C. Johnston who was daughter of Nathaniel and Lucy Burwell.
