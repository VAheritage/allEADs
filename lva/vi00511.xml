      <p>Robert Rives (1798-1869) was born in Nelson County,
         Virginia, and attended the College of William and Mary,
         graduating in 1817. He represented Nelson County, Virginia, in
         the House of Delegates from 1823- 1829. After his service in
         the House of Delegates, he moved to Albemarle County. Rives
         was one of the wealthiest men in Virginia before the Civil War
         began, but he lost most of his fortune during the war. He
         married Elizabeth Pannhill (1811-1895), daughter of Samuel
         Pannhill of Campbell County, Virginia, in 1841. They had one
         child, Cornelia E. Rives (1845-1910), who married Charles
         Carter Harrison (1842-1882) in 1866. Harrison served as a
         lieutenant in Company I, 46th Virginia Infantry. After the
         Civil War, Harrison became a prosperous farmer in Albemarle
         County.</p>
