      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Mr. Ackerman was a former employee of the Office of State
         Forester from 1921 to 1926. He later became a professor of
         forestry at the University of Virginia. He maintained frequent
         contact with his former employers and these files document
         some of his extensive work in the area of assuring the scenic
         forestry in Virginia would be maintained.</p>
      <p>The Office of the State Forester has been a part of
         numerous department reorganizations since its' establishment
         in 1914. The following is a brief chronology of the various
         names of parent agencies of the Office of State Forester: (1)
         State Geological Survey Commission, 1914-1926; (2) State
         Conservation and Development Commission, 1926-1938; (3)
         Virginia Conservation Commission, 1938-1948; (4) Department of
         Conservation and Economic Development, 1948-1985; (4)
         Department of Conservation and Historic Resources, 1985-1989;
         and (5) Department of Conservation and Recreation, 1989-.
         During these various reorganizations the responsibilities and
         duties of the Office increased resulting in bureau and later
         division status for the State Forester.</p>
      <p>In 1914 the Legislature created the Office of State
         Forester under the direction of the State Geological Survey
         Commission. The responsibility of the State Forester was "the
         supervision and direction of all forest interests and all
         matters pertaining to forestry within the state." The
         Legislature provided no appropriations for funding of the
         office and expenses were to be assumed by the University of
         Virginia. In return, the State Forester was appointed the
         Professor of Forestry at the University of Virginia and was
         expected to teach one class. In 1916 the Legislature
         appropriated increased funding for the Office allowing for the
         hiring of five professionally trained forestry staff members
         and the development of a state nursery.</p>
      <p>In 1919 the legislature increased the duties of the State
         Forester with the following responsibilties (1) the control of
         all forest fire fighting measures; (2) the investigation of
         methods of conservation and education in forestry; (3) the
         cooperation with private landowners in sound forestry
         practices; (4) the maintenance of the state forest nursery and
         distribution of tree reforestation; (5) the right to purchase
         and manage lands as state forest; (5) the investigation of
         stream flows within the state.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The office files of Alfred Ackerman highlights four
         specific topics of interest. The files documenting the Chapin
         Jones Case involves the controversial and political firestorm
         concerning the removal of Mr. Jones from the position of State
         Forester. Mr. Jones had been State Forester for eighteen years
         when Mr. William E. Carson (Chairman of the State Commission
         on Conservation and Development) had several disputes
         regarding the administration of the Office of the State
         Forester. The request made by Mr. Carson for Jones to resign
         and Jones' subsequent refusal and demand for an open hearing
         on the issue, made for interesting news converage. This series
         documents Mr. Ackerman's (former employee under State Forester
         Chapin Jones) contributions to the case providing
         correspondence, newclippings and a published report entitled
         "What Ails the Conservation Commission."</p>
      <p>The second area of interest concerns the Shenandoah Park.
         These files offer Alfred Ackerman's opinions and concerns
         regarding the federal government's initial move to establish a
         national park in the valley. This series contains, pamphlets,
         correspondence, and reports discussing among other things the
         validity of appropriating state tax dollars for a national
         project.</p>
      <p>The Virginia Forest Fire on White Cedar consists of
         correspondence and research notes outlining the concerns of
         the drainage of swamps and the forest growth in Virginia. The
         files includes trip expense tallies for camping and
         explorations made by Ackerman and the staff of the Office of
         State Forester. There are research notes and reports from the
         results of the Forest staffs research explorations.</p>
      <p>The Virginia Forestry files contains correspondence, fire
         reports, expense vouchers and research notes. This series
         gives insight into the daily operations of the Office
         concerning forestry issues. There are detailed prosecution
         reports giving the names and address of alleged to have
         started fires. The Fire report forms give the location of
         fire, date of fire acres burned damage to growth and the names
         of the accused fire perpetrators. There is correspondence from
         members of the private sector as well as the federal
         government seeking information and advice about forestry
         concerns.</p>
