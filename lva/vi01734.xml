      <p>Robert Taylor Berry was born 6 July 1812 at Berry Plain in King George County, Virginia. He became a minister and married Ann Frame Griggs (10 August 1817-26 August 185?). They had at least two sons. Robert Berry served a church located in Georgetown in the District of Columbia. He died 2 November 1887 in Winchester, Virginia. Robert and Ann Berry are buried in Edge Hill cemetery in Charles Town, Jefferson County, West Virginia. Eliza M. Griggs (1794-1859), the mother of Ann Berry, lived in Charles Town. Katherine H.
