<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Godfrey Miller (1730-1803) was the proprietor of two apothecaries in Winchester, Virginia. Upon his death, his four sons (Abraham, John, Godfrey II, and Peter) inherited the business, with two running one pharmacy and two running the other. The stores merged in 1845. The business, known as Miller's Drug Store, stayed in the family until it was sold to Garland Spillman in 1943. The recipe book cataloged here, which likely contains formulas that belonged originally to Godfrey Miller as well as ones added after his death, was among the pharmacy's records. Note: Information provided by Alan McKay, Dean, Bernard J. Dunn School of Pharmacy, Shenandoah University.
