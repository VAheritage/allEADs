</head>
        <p>This negative photostatic volume was created by the Virginia State Library's (now the Library of Virginia) Archives Division, under the accession number 21594, from the original volume found in the Isle of Wight's Circuit Court Clerk's Office.
</p>
        <p>The eleven volumes and or boxes came to to the Library of Virginia in a shipment of court papers from Isle of Wight County. One collection was transferred under accession number 13860.</p>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545$a">
      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Isle of Wight County was one of the original shires, or counties, first enumerated in 1634.  The present name was given in 1637.  Parts of Nansemond County were added in 1769 and 1772.
</p>
      <p>The early tax laws required the tax commissioner in each district to record in "a fair alphabetical list" the names of persons owning land or town lots, the quality of land owned, the value of the land or lots and the amount of tax owed. Each tract or lot owned by an individual was to be entered separately.
</p>
      <p>"Processioning consisted of a person or persons appointed by the vestries (later the county court) meeting with the land owners and walking their property boundaries with them and remarking their lines and corners. At least one other person, preferably an adjacent land owner, would accompany the owner and the processioner. Perhaps this "processioning" of people walking the boundaries is the basis for the term "processioning." The objective of this practice seems to have been to prevent boundary disputes between adjacent land owners by renewing and maintaining survey marks. However, most of the marks used were temporary items such as trees and bushes. Processioning was not done annually, nor was the entire county done at the same time. Usually processioning was done by militia districts, or some other governmental subdivision of the county."
</p>
      <p>Until 1780, marriages could be performed only by ministers of the Established Church, who were required by law to record marriages in the parish register. In 1780, dissenting ministers (only four per county from each sect) were first permitted to perform marriage ceremonies. Ministers' returns were required by law beginning in 1780, so all marriages from that date would be of record in the county court clerk's office--thereby creating an official record. Some ministers adopted a custom of making collected returns--a list of marriages performed within a period of time such as a year or several years. Beginning in 1784, marriage certificates were returned annually. The law was rarely enforced, and ministers' returns were sometimes late, incorrect, incomplete and in many instances, not made at all. Once the marriage service was performed, the minister submitted a return to the county clerk. The county clerk recorded these returns along with other marriage records, such as licenses, in a volume.
</p>
      <p>The original records, from which this volume was comprised, were created by the County Court.

          <p>Isle of Wight County (Va.) Various Record Series, 1775-1837, is a collection of original items from early county records related to the categories of tax, land, marriage and governmental activities. Leaves 1-14, 1778, cover appointments and returns from tax assessors. All taxable property was assessed in the county's three districts--including land and slaves. Processioners' reports are found on leaves 20-30 and span the years 1795-1796 and 1804. Ministers' Returns are recorded on leaves 44-72 and include the years 1785-1837.  Whether single or in the form of lists, these returns record the date of marriage and the names of both parties.  Returns frequently mentioned the minister's denomination.  Processioners' returns from 1824 comprise the largest section of the volume from leaves 73-159. Elected committees noted all business related to county affairs from 1775 to 1832 and are found on leaves 160-171. Leaves 15-19 were skipped in the course of numbering these items to compile this volume.  The volume was originally titled, Isle of Wight (Va.) Miscellany, 1775-1852.
