      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Nicholas C. Kinney (1785-1859), a veteran of the War of 1812, was a lawyer in Staunton, Virginia. In 1828, Kinney was appointed as clerk of court for Augusta County. Kinney was also the owner of an 850 acre farm located in Augusta County.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Daybook, 1817-1823, was used primarily to record the various suits that Kinney presented at court. Each entry lists the style of suit with court costs and notes the amounts of money owed and paid by his client. Throughout the volume Kinney recorded tasks he needed to accomplish. Some of these tasks relate to his cases (filing warrants, etc.) but other tasks are of a personal nature such as notes to buy candles and tobacco. The volume also contains occasional references to Kinney's farm. Kinney documented plantings and what crops were growing in certain pastures.
</p>
      <p>Ledger, 1815-1819, was used primarily to record the personal financial activities of Nicholas C. Kinney. Accounts are organized by the individual or company with which Kinney transacted business. Information found in each entry includes the date, type of transaction, and the monies debited or credited to the account. Most transactions concerned the lending of money and the purchase of items such as clothing, lumber, grain, and furniture. Kinney also provided cash accounts to record the cash he had on hand. Information found in these entries include the amounts paid and received along with the name of the individuals with which he did business. In addition, the back of the volume includes a list of slaves hired out in 1818, and the list includes the name of the slave, to whom they were hired out, and the amounts paid. Slaves mentioned by name include Betty, Jacob, Martin, Edmund, and Obed.</p>
      <p>Ledger, 1823-1828, records the financial aspects of cases tried by Kinney. Information found in each entry includes the style of suit, date of court hearing, and any court costs incurred. No indication is provided as to the nature of the case, but some entries do include amounts of debt or damages involved in the case. Some entries note that property was sold to help pay court costs. One such entry for the case of James Allen versus John Allen records the sale of a female slave named Louisa.</p>
      <p>Ledger, 1828-1830, records items purchased for Kinney's farm and his personal use. Account entries are listed chronologically and are divided into spring purchases and fall purchases. Each account is listed under the business name where the items were bought. Information found in each account entry includes a listing of the items purchased, the amounts paid for each item, and the total purchase price. Examples of items purchased include coffee, tools, hardware, tack and saddlery, cotton, stoneware, cloth, spirits, and shoes. Kinney entered the total amount of purchases at the end of each season. The final entry in the volume totals all purchases for 1828-1830.</p>
