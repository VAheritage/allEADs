<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>On February 21, 1818, the Virginia legislature passed a school bill which appropriated $45,000 annually from the Literary Fund for the education of poor children. (The Literary Fund was established in 1810 with passage of a bill to appropriate "certain escheats, confiscated, and forfeited lands" for the "encouragement of learning.") Under the provisions of the 1818 School Act, each county court was required to appoint five to fifteen commissioners to establish and/or administer schools for children of the poor. A more comprehensive public school system was established by the legislature in 1870. It was racially segregated until the mid-twentieth century.</p>
<p>Frederick County was named in honor of Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales and eldest son of George II. It was formed from Orange County in 1738, but, because the region was sparsely settled, county government was not organized until 1743. Part of Augusta County was added later.
