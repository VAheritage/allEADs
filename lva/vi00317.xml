      <p>David Ross was one of the richest of all planters in
         Virginia in the 1780's. Born in Scotland about 1739, Ross
         immigrated to the United States in the mid-1750's. By the time
         of the American Revolution, he had established himself as a
         leading tobacco merchant and shipowner in Richmond and
         Petersburg. Ross also owned and managed a large plantation at
         Point of Fork at the junction of the James and Rivanna Rivers.
         By the late 1780's, when his wealth reached its peak, he had
         amassed over 100,000 acres of land scattered across twelve
         Virginia counties. Ross also owned more horses than anyone in
         the state; owned the second most amount of cattle; and claimed
         ownership of 400 slaves, the fifth highest amount in the
         state.</p>
      <p>Early in the war, Ross had to defend himself against
         loyalist charges; though, he successfully subverted all
         attempts to slander his name, in part by supporting patriot
         troops financially. In late 1780 Ross began a tenure as
         commercial agent for Virginia, a position whose responsibility
         was the supply of state troops with clothing, weapons, and
         ammunition. He drew heavily upon his own wealth to suffice the
         troops' demands. In April 1782 Ross resigned his post in order
         to take a position in the Virginia General Assembly. After the
         war Ross expanded his investments and developed the most
         important industrial property he had acquired during the war
         years, the Oxford Iron Works. This pig-iron juggernaut was
         located south of the James River eight miles from Lynchburg.
         In fact he had acquired the Works around 1776 and began almost
         immediately to exploit the wartime demand for iron. By the
         early 1780's, Thomas Jefferson estimated that the Works
         produced more pig iron than any other industrial furnace in
         Virginia. Yet for several reasons Ross, the Works, and his
         estate fell on hard times in the early 1800's. The provisions
         of his will and the necessity of settling his debts were the
         prime factors behind the sale of the Oxford slave force
         following Ross' death in 1819.</p>
