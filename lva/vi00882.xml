</head>
      <p>James Pleasants, Jr., was born at "Contention" in Goochland County on 24 October 1769 to James Pleasants and Anne Randolph, aunt of Thomas Jefferson. Pleasants briefly attended William and Mary College in 1785
before reading law with Judge William Fleming of the Virginia Court of Appeals. In 1790, he married Susanna Lawson Rose, second daughter of Col. Hugh Rose. Pleasants fathered eight children, including John
Hampden, founder of the Richmond Whig, who died in a duel with Thomas Ritchie. In 1791, Pleasants joined the bar of Amelia County. He began his career in politics in 1797 with an election to the House of Delegates
representing Goochland County until 1802. Between 1802 and 1811, Pleasants served as clerk of the House of Delegates. Though elected judge in the Court of Appeals in 1811, Pleasants declined the post in order to
serve the first of four terms in the U. S. House of Representatives as a Democrat Republican. An anti-British advocate during the War of 1812, Pleasants supported the growth of the navy as chairman of the
Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Navy. Pleasants resigned on 14 December 1819 in order to accept an appointment by the Virginia Legislature to replace John W. Eppes in the U. S. Senate. While in
the Senate, Pleasants served as chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs during the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Congresses. Pleasants later resigned from the Senate in December 1822 in order to succeed Thomas Mann
Randolph as governor. During his three one-year terms as governor, Pleasants coped with a fire at the Penitentiary, boundary issues with the state of Maryland, and General Lafayette's visit to Virginia. In
addition, Pleasants managed the settlement of Virginia's claims against the United States for War of 1812 expenditures and the establishment of the Western Lunatic Asylum in Staunton, Virginia. Although Pleasants
retired from public life following his governorship, he remained active in politics as an Anti-Jacksonian. In 1829, Pleasants was elected as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830. Pleasants died
on 9 November 1836 at his home in Goochland County following a long illness.
