      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Petersburg was formed from parts of Dinwiddie, Prince George, and Chesterfield counties.  A garrison and fur trading post called Fort Henry was established in 1645 on the site of the Indian village of Appamattuck.  The present name, suggested in 1733 by William Byrd II, honors Peter Jones, Byrd's companion on expeditions into the Virginia backcountry.  Petersburg was established in 1748 and incorporated as a town in 1784.  In the latter year the towns of Blandford, Pocahontas, and Ravenscroft were added to Petersburg.  It was incorporated as a city in 1850.  Petersburg was enlarged by annexation from both Prince George and Dinwiddie counties in 1972.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Petersburg (Va.) Recorded and Unrecorded Deeds, 1775-1924 (bulk 1801-1848 and 1880-1924) consist of deeds of bargain and sale, deeds of gift, mortgages, and deeds of trust both recorded and unrecorded. Recorded deeds were proved and recorded in deed books. Unrecorded deeds were never proved and recorded in deed books. A few of the deeds include plats. Enslaved people were often transferred in deeds of gift or were listed in mortgages and deeds of trust.
</p>
      <p>Deeds of bargain and sale are the most commonly recorded deed in which one individual sells property, usually land, but occasionally personal property, to another individual. Such deeds show the names of the grantor and grantee, the residence of both parties, a description of what is being sold, the consideration (or price), the location of the tract of land, the tract's boundaries, and any limitations on the property being sold. The deed was signed by the grantor, and possibly his wife or anyone else having a claim to the property, and by at least two witnesses. Appended to the deed may be a memorandum of livery of seisin, stating that the property has changed hands and that peaceful possession has taken place.</p>
      <p>Deeds of gift are often found transferring property, either real or personal, from one individual to another "for love and affection." The degree of kinship, if any, between the grantor and grantee is sometimes stated.</p>
      <p>Mortgages and deeds of trust were deeds where one party is indebted to another and transfers or mortgages property to a third party to secure the debt.</p>
