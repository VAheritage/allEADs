<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Charlotte County was named for Charlotte of MecklenburgStrelitz, consort of George III.  It was formed from Lunenburg County in 1764.  Its area is 471 square miles, and the county seat is Charlotte Court House.
</p>
<p> The separate office of coroner appeared in Virginia about 1660.  The judicial duty of the office is to hold inquisitions in cases when persons meet sudden, violent, unnatural or suspicious death, or death without medical attendance.  The coroner would summon a jury to assist him in determining cause of death.  Prior to November 1877, the jurors numbered twelve.  Between November 1877 and March 1926, the jurors numbered six.  The jury viewed the body of the deceased and heard the testimony of witnesses.  The coroner was required to write down witness testimony.  After seeing and hearing the evidence, the jury delivered in writing to the coroner their conclusion concerning cause of death referred to as inquisition.  After March 1926, only the coroner determined cause of death.  He could require physicians to assist him with determining cause of death.  If a criminal act was determined to be the cause of death, the coroner was to deliver the guilty person to the sheriff and the coroners' inquests would be used as evidence in the criminal trial. </p>
