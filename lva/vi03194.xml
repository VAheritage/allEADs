      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Goochland County was named for Sir William Gooch, lieutenant governor of Virginia from 1727 to 1749. It was formed from Henrico County in 1728. The county seat is Goochland.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Goochland County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1731-1924, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.
</p>

          <p>Lewis Brooks, also referred to as Lewy, was advertised to be sold following the death of Thomas Brooks, Lewis’ enslaver, as the assets belonging to Thomas’ estate were not enough to discharge his debts. Consequently, Lewis sued for his freedom, claiming that Thomas’ will provided for his emancipation. He also stated that his wife and children were enslaved by Mary M. Garland, whose will stipulated that they might be freed if they wished and, if so, Lewis should be purchased with funds from Mary’s estate and likewise liberated. According to Lewis, James M. Garland, Mary’s executor, had thus far neglected to purchase Lewis as Mary’s will had prescribed despite his wife and children having elected to be emancipated. Ultimately, the court ordered James to buy Lewis and free him based on the provisions of Mary’s will.</p>
