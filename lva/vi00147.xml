         <p>Henrico Parish dates from 1611 with the founding of
         Henricopolis. The county of Henrico was one of the original
         shires of 1634 and at the time lay on both sides of the James
         River, extending indefinitely westward from the Charles City
         County line. Henrico Parish was coterminous with the county.
         Although very early records have not survived, St. John's
         Church records begin in 1730 and are records of the whole of
         Henrico Parish to 1770.</p>
         <p>St. John's Church, completed 10 June 1741, was in reality
         the fourth church in the parish and did not for some time
         become the main parish church. Throughout the earlier records
         it is referred to as the New Church, the Church on Richmond
         Hill, the Town Church, or simply the Church. Not until 1829
         was it identified as St. John's Church. For more information
         see, A 
         <title render="italic">Story of St. John's Church, Henrico
         Parish, 1607-1964,</title> by Grace E. Taliaferro, 1968.</p>
         <p>St. James Episcopal Church had been in the process of
         organization for a few years before the cornerstone was laid
         on 2 April 1838, at I (now Marshall) and 5th streets. In 1831,
         a group of churchmen agreed that the western part of Richmond
         needed an Episcopal Church and in 1835 land was conveyed for
         its construction. The church was consecrated on 23 June
         1839.</p>
         <p>St. Philip's Church, an African-American church established
         in 1861, was originally located on North Fourth street between
         Leigh and Jackson streets. The congregation ceased to exist in
         1865, probably due to the burning of Richmond at the end of
         the Civil War, but in 1866, it applied for admittance to
         Council. A new church was erected in 1870 on the corner of
         Foushee (now St. James) and Leigh streets and a brick
         structure was built in 1896. In 1959, St. Philip's Church
         purchased the buildings of the Church of the Epiphany on the
         corner of Hanes Avenue and Essex Street.</p>
         <p>Monumental Episcopal Church was built in 1814 on the site
         of the Richmond Theater, which burned to the ground on 26
         December 1811. The church was erected as a memorial to the
         seventy-two victims of the fire, including the governor of
         Virginia, George William Smith.</p>
         <p>St. Andrew's Episcopal Church was the successor of the
         Belvidere Mission School begun in March 1874 as a mission of
         the St. Paul's Episcopal Church. The school grew so rapidly
         that each new quarters became too small. With assistance from
         the Vestry of St. Paul's Church, construction of a new school
         and chapel began on 29 April 1875. The new church was
         consecrated by Bishop F.M. Whittle of the Diocese of Virginia
         on 30 December 1877. In 1884, St. Andrew's Church became a
         mission church of the Diocese and elected its first vestry.
         Financial support from St. Paul's was reduced in 1887 and
         discontinued in 1888.</p>
