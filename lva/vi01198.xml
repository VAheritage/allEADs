<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Moody and Price was a shipping company headquartered in the city of Richmond, Virginia, during the late eighteenth century. The letter book was perhaps used as an exhibit in a court case heard in Richmond County.
</p>
<p>Richmond County may have been named for Richmond borough in Surrey, England, or for Charles Lennox, first duke of Richmond and a son of King Charles II. It was formed from Old Rappahannock County in 1692. The county seat is Warsaw.
</p>
<p>Some volumes were burned and mutilated through unknown causes; in addition, the will books prior to 1699 were missing as early as 1793, and order books for the period 1794-1816 are also missing. Numerous loose records prior to 1781 are missing as well.
