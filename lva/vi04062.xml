      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Context for Record Type:</emph> Chancery Causes are cases of equity. According to Black's Law Dictionary they are "administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law." A judge, not a jury, determines the outcome of the case; however, the judge is basing the decision on findings compiled and documented by Commissioners. Chancery causes are useful when researching local history, genealogical information, and land or estate divisions. They are a valuable source of local, state, social, and legal history and serve as a primary source for understanding a locality's history. Chancery causes document the lived experiences of free and enslaved individuals; women; children; people living with physical disabilities or mental health struggles; people living in poverty; defunct institutions and corporate entities; or those that may not have otherwise left traditional written histories.
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Elizabeth City County (extinct) was named for Elizabeth, daughter of King James I, and was one of the original shires, or counties, first enumerated in 1634. It became extinct on 1 July 1952 when it was incorporated into the city of Hampton, which was the county seat. 
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Locality History:</emph> Hampton was located in Elizabeth City County, which is now extinct. It takes its name from Hampton Creek, earlier called Southampton River in honor of the earl of Southampton, an important figure in the Virginia Company of London. An Indian town stood on the site in 1607, when Captain John Smith visited the area. The colonists established a village there in 1610 and a trading post in 1630. Hampton was established by an act of assembly in 1680 and was designated as a port of entry in 1705. It was first incorporated as a town in March 1849, but the act was repealed the following December. It was incorporated again in 1852, but the act of incorporation was repealed in 1860. The General Assembly incorporated the town of Hampton in 1887 for a third time, and it became a city by court order on 4 March 1908. It was greatly enlarged on 1 July 1952 by a merger with Elizabeth City County and the town of Phoebus; the county and town thereby became extinct. 
</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Lost Locality Note:</emph> Records were burned and/or destroyed during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Additional records were burned in Richmond on 3 April 1865, where they had been moved for safekeeping during the Civil War. A few pre–Civil War volumes such as deed books, will books, and order books exist.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Elizabeth City County (Va.) Chancery Causes, 1747-1935, consists of cases concerning issues of equity brought largely by residents of the county and filed in the circuit court. These cases often involve the following actions: divisions of estates or land, disputes over wills, disputes regarding contracts, debt, divorce, and business disputes. Other less prevalent issues include freedom suits, permissions to sell property, and disputes concerning trespass. Predominant documents found in these chancery causes include bills (documents the plaintiff's complaint), answers (defendant's response to the plaintiff's complaint), decrees (court's decision), depositions, affidavits, correspondence, lists of heirs, deeds, plats, wills, records involving enslaved individuals, business records or vital statistics.
</p>
      <p>Chancery causes that ended before 1865, as well as some that ended afterwards, may contain information related to free and enslaved Black and multiracial individuals. However, these cases largely represent the perspective of white enslavers and their disputes involving the sale, hiring, financial responsibilities, and legality of ownership of Black individuals. Under the system of chattel slavery, laws permitted enslavers to treat enslaved people as personal possessions in the same manner as livestock, farm equipment, or household items.
</p>
<p>Commonly found surnames among the plaintiffs and defendants include Allen, Armistead, Banks, Barnes, Booker, Brown, Collier, Cooper, Cumming, Curtis, Davis, Elliott, Herbert, Howard, Hudgins, Johnson, Jones, King, Latimer (also spelled Lattimer), Lee, Lively (also spelled Liveley), Mallory, Mears, Parker, Peek, Phillips, Robinson, Rogers, Shield, Smith, Tabb, Taylor, Tennis, Walker, Wallace, Watts, West, Whiting, Williams, Wilson, and Wood. The Bank of Hampton is involved in 9 suits between 1901 and 1915; the Galilean Fishermans Bank is involved in 8 suits between 1911 and 1913; the Newport News &amp; Old Point Railway &amp; Electric Company is involved in 17 suits between 1899 and 1909; and the Hampton Roads Railway &amp; Electric Company is involved in 11 suits between 1902 and 1907.
</p>
<p>The chancery causes are primarily comprised of debt suits, which ended between 1762 and 1913; divorce suits, which ended between 1830 and 1913; and estate suits, which ended between 1747 and 1913. The debt suits concern businesses, such as hotels and construction companies, and private citizens, while the estate suits generally involve the distribution of property. Several divorce suits, especially those involving domestic abuse, contain associated criminal causes. Recurrent topics of interest include African Americans (post Civil War), enslavement, and property.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>This suit originated in Norfolk County. The Norfolk County Ferry Committee and a Norfolk County harbor master, as well as several citizens, claimed that a dock, known as the County Dock and located in the city of Norfolk, had been set aside for public use 60 or 70 years before 1876. However, the Norfolk County Board of Supervisors voted to lease the dock to Herbert L. Smith in 1875. The plaintiffs argued that the Board of Supervisors had no right to lease the dock for private use and asked that the lease be nullified. The suit includes 2 plats of the dock area.

<p>Maria E. Curtis claimed that the contract she signed conveying her land to Jerome Titlow was executed under false and fraudulent pretenses. According to Curtis, Titlow purchased her land after denying rumors that the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway planned to construct a deepwater terminal at Newport News, which would have increased the value of Curtis’ land. After the sale, Curtis discovered Titlow’s duplicity and realized that, due to his misrepresentations, she had sold him her land for a lower price than it otherwise might have been worth. Curtis stated that E. S. Hamlin, a land agent of Collis P. Huntington, a railway magnate, was residing with Titlow at the time.

</unittitle>
</did>
<scopecontent>
<p>This suit involves a dispute between the heirs of James Williams, who sought to determine James’ lawful heirs based on his pre-Civil War “slave marriage” and his post-Civil War marriage.  James was enslaved by Samuel Chisman prior to the Civil War and married Dizy, a woman enslaved by a Miss Whiting, in 1835. Mary Susan Williams, the plaintiff, was born of this relationship. G. A. Cary, a deponent in the suit, stated that Mary Susan was transported to Montgomery, Alabama, at an unspecified date after she was purchased from the estate of John C. Whiting. Dizy died in 1859, and James married Rebecca Marrow in 1866, with whom he had Annie Williams. Mary Susan claimed to be the rightful heir to James’ estate, as she believed that James and Rebecca were never legally married. Adversely, Rebecca claimed that James never recognized Mary Susan as his child. The court ultimately decreed that both Mary Susan and Annie were lawful heirs of James, and that Rebecca was due dower rights in the distribution of the property.
