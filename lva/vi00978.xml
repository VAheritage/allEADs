<p>The State Budget Files series is housed in 17 boxes and is arranged chronologically by budget cycle.  This series documents the budgetary process during the Kaine Administration. Subjects include:  Kaine's 2006 transportation plan, 2006 budget stalemate, 2007 electricity regulation, 2007 transportation compromise, development of the 2008-2010 biennium budget, 2008 special session on transportation, 2009 budget amendments and the development of the 2010-2012 biennium budget.
</p>

<p>Notable documents on the <emph render="bold">2006 budget stalemate</emph> include:  email from Brian Shepard describing a potential continuity of operations timeline for June 2006; memorandum to Governor Kaine from Larry Roberts, 23 May 2006, describing the Governor's authority in the event that Virginia does not have a budget in place as of July 1, 2006; and notes from 6 May 2006 meeting; draft of an advisory opinion written by Attorney General Robert F. McDonnell, dated 23 May 2006, on the Governor's authority to initiate a spending plan in the event a budget bill is not passed by July 1, 2006 (all b22, f3).

Email describes the team's 3 camps on the issue:  hardliners who believe that the Republicans will not compromise and the Governor may have to veto the bill; advisors who believe the administration is in a strong position to cut a deal with House Republicans; and the third group is unsure if the administration can cut a deal and the governor may have to sign a flawed bill.  Email also includes as an attachment a Status Report on Transportation Strategic Plan (b24, f4); memorandum to Governor Kaine from Mark Rubin, undated, outline of structure of negotiations on transportation bill (b24, f5); and Gov. Kaine's handwritten notes on the transportation bill, undated, but probably used for meetings with groups in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads (b24, f5)
