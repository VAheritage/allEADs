<head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
<p>Lemuel Durbin  Williams (1831?-1865) was a member of the Washington Light Infantry militia for several years prior to the start of the Civil War.  When the D.C. Militia Infantry was formed to defend Washington D.C. in the early days of the Civil War, he joined the Washington Light Infantry for a 3-month tour of duty on April 10, 1861 and initially served as a 1st Lieutenant.  Upon the promotion of Captain Lemuel Towers a month later, Williams was promoted to Captain and took command of the company.  He was mustered out on July 10, 1861.  Influenced by his work with a volunteer militia and his service in the Civil War he published one military instruction manual early in 1861 and wrote two other related works that apparently were never published.</p>
<p>By profession Williams was a draughtsman.  He worked for the United States Coast Survey and later for the Northwest Boundary Survey Office.  Examples of maps that Williams worked on can be found online at the Library of Congress American Memory site.  Information about additional maps can be found on the American Philosophical Society website.  Professionally and for publication he used the names L.D. Williams and Lem D. Williams.  His outside interests extended to submitting two designs for a Treasury note; he received the offered premium because significant amounts of his designs were incorporated into the final product.</p>
<p>Williams married Sarah M. O'Donnell in 1852.  He died at age 34 on July 31, 1865 after a short illness.  He was survived by his wife and six children.</p>
