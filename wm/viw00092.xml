      <p><emph render="bold">The James River and Kanawha Company</emph><lb/>The creation of Virginia's canal system was begun in
         1746, spurred on by the support of George Washington and
         Thomas Jefferson. The goal was to create an economical and
         reliable way for farmers living in the interior of the state
         to transport their goods to market. To achieve this, existing
         rivers were widened, dams were created to control water
         levels, bridges and aqueducts were erected, and a lock system
         established.</p>
      <p>The James River Company was created to raise capital for
         this venture. For a time, the venture was very successful,
         producing significant returns for its investors. However, the
         citizens of Virginia demanded that the company also maintain
         and/or improve the canal structure. When the company was
         unable or unwilling to comply, the state bought the charter in
         1820. The state intended to further improve the Kanawha River
         and to connect the existing canal to the western part of the
         country, via the Ohio River. The invention of the railroad,
         however, cast doubt upon the wisdom of this scheme.</p>
      <p>Joseph Carrington Cabell became the leading proponent of
         the canal system. He, along with his long time friend John
         Hartwell Cocke, was able to convince the state to consider a
         joint public/private charter in 1832. The charter was
         conditioned upon the procurement of five million dollars in
         private capital. It took Cabell and his supporters nearly
         three years to interest enough investors in the project.
         Finally in 1835 the General Assembly officially granted a
         charter to the James River and Kanawha Company. Joseph Cabell
         was elected as its first president.</p>
      <p>Canal construction was divided into three divisions.
         Ultimately, the plan was to connect Richmond to Covington.
         Further, railroad lines were to be added after the final
         division was completed in order to link towns to the
         waterways. Unfortunately, the company was faced with a myriad
         of technical and economic problems; subscribers refused to
         pay, flooding was continual, working conditions were
         deplorable creating severe labor shortages, and early work on
         the canal proved to be defective requiring nearly continuous
         repair work.</p>
      <p>The demise of the James River Company was further hastened
         by the Civil War. In 1863, General Sheridan and his troops
         razed many of the bridges and canals and most of the company
         papers were destroyed during the burning of Richmond. This
         alone wasn't fatal, but without the funds for repairs the
         problems worsened. The combination of these difficulties,
         coupled with increasing competition from the railroads finally
         became too great and The James River and Kanawha Company was
         terminated by the General Assembly in 1880. Its assets were
         subsequently sold to the Richmond &amp; Allegheny Railway
         Company.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">John Hartwell Cocke</emph><lb/>John Hartwell Cocke was born in Surry County, Virginia
         in 1780. He attended the College of William and Mary from
         1794-1799. After serving in the War of 1812, he returned to
         his home, Bremo, a plantation in Fluvanna County, Virginia, to
         pursue an agrarian career. Known for his agricultural
         experimentation with crops and livestock, he maintained
         several estates and plantations in Virginia and Alabama. He
         helped found the University of Virginia, and set up a boy's
         seminary on Bremo. Although he owned many slaves, he
         encouraged their education, set up systems for them to buy
         their freedom, and supported their colonization in Africa.</p>
      <p>Being a deeply religious man, John Hartwell Cocke held
         strong views against drinking and tobacco. In order to combat
         these "evils," he was elected president of the American
         Temperance Union in 1836, and stopped all production of
         tobacco on his land. These views also led him to support and
         become a member of the James River and Kanawha Company board
         of directors. He believed that many poor farmers in Virginia
         were forced to turn their grain into whiskey because there was
         no profitable way to transport the grain to market. He felt
         that with the creation of the canal, farmers would turn to
         other occupations, thereby lessening the supply of alcohol and
         with it the desire to drink. He married Ann Blaus Barraud in
         1802 and fathered several children. He died in 1866.</p>
