      <p>William Preston (ca. 1729-1783) held various county offices
         and militia offices. His sons were John Preston (1764-1827),
         who was a member of the Virginia General Assembly and
         treasurer of Virginia, and Francis Preston (1765-1836).
         Francis Preston was born in Botetourt County, graduated from
         the College of William and Mary and practiced law in
         Montgomery and Washington counties. He served in the Virginia
         House of Delegates and State Senate and served in Congress
         1793-1797. His son was William Campbell Preston (1794-1860)
         who attended Washington College (now Washington and Lee
         University) and South Carolina College (now University of
         South Carolina). He also studied law in Scotland and practiced
         in Virginia and later in South Carolina. He served in the
         South Carolina House of Representatives and in the United
         States Senate. William Campbell Preston was president of South
         Carolina College.</p>

         1755-1782, primarily photostats of appointments to various
         county offices (coroner, sheriff and surveyor) and to
         positions in the Virginia militia; but also including original
         appointments, 1763 and 1776; a surveyor's entry; 1774; and
         letters, 1773-1782, to Preston concerning land, the Cherokee
         Indians and a court martial.</p>
      <p>Items, 1785-1819, relating to William's sons, Francis
