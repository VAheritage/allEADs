Claire records daily activities such as school visits, reading, attending concerts, social and family activities, vacations, taking music lessons and playing tennis and going to the YWCA. Also included are two calling cards, one of Claire's and one of her uncle as well as a newspaper clipping for the "Tennessee Colored Jubilee Singers," whose performance Claire mentions in her diary.The following description was provided by the seller:"The first diary was kept in a ledger book. It measures 3 1/2" x 5 1/2", and has 47 pages filled with entries that date from July 18, 1907 to September 20, 1907. The second diary was kept in a memorandum book. It measures 4 3/4" x 6 1/4", and has 84 pages filled with entries that date from September 21, 1907 to April 3, 1908. Claire writes of her activities at school, home, and with her friends.
