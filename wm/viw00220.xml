      <head>Biographical Note
</head>
      <p>Born in England in 1846, Burt married Ellen Augusta Alexander in 1871. He died in Bristol, Ma. in 1890.</p>
      <p>The following is quoted from an obituary from the Herald of Gospel Liberty, June 26th, 1890 (included with the diary) and ancestry.com:
A Messenger informed me yesterday of the death of Rev. Arthur Burt of Smith Mills, in the town of Dartmouth Mass. He fell asleep on the morning of May 5th. In company with Bro. B. S. Batchelor I drove over to his late residence to see his sorrowing family and arrange for his funeral, which will take place on Thursday, May 8th. Bro. Burt had been suffering for many months from heart trouble so that many times he would be obliged to sit down two or three times during the delivery of a sermon. His disease has increased in severity so that he was compelled to resign his pastorate some time since. Bro. Burt was born in England and was about 43 years old. He came to America when about 23 years of age. I do not know how long he has preached but most of his labor has been in New York and New Jersey. He came to Massachusetts about 14 months ago and has labored very acceptable until compelled to retire from his work. He married his wife in Cayuga County N.Y. where most of her friends reside. He leaves a wife and seven children, four sons and three daughters. Our brother was highly esteemed by all who knew him, but in our loss we are consoled by the though that he has exchanged a life of sickness and pain for a rest of bliss. He was conscious of his near approach to the end of the journey but was sustained by the hope of mortality. I. H. Coe.
