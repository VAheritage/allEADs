      <p>John Marshall (1755-1835) was born near Germantown, Prince
         William (currently Fauquier) County, Virginia on 24 September
         1755 to parents Thomas Marshall and Mary Randolph Keith. From
         1775-1781, Marshall served in the Continental Army and fought
         in the Revolutionary War. During the spring and summer of
         1780, Marshall attended classes at the College of William and
         Mary and received his license to practice law. After the war,
         he moved to Richmond, Virginia and began his practice.
         Marshall married Mary Willis Ambler in 1783. The couple had
         ten children, six of whom survived to adulthood. He was
         elected as a delegate to the Virginia House of Delegates in
         1780 and 1782-1788. Later, he was appointed by President John
         Adams to a special commission to France from 1797-1798. The
         commission, which brought about the famous XYZ affair, failed
         to settle existing differences between France and the U.S.
         From 1799-1800, Marshall served as a Federalist representative
         in the 6th United States Congress. He did not serve out his
         term however, as he was appointed by Adams to serve as U.S.
         Secretary of State from 1800-1801. Later, Marshall received
         yet another appointment from Adams this time to the bench as
         the fourth chief justice of the Supreme Court. He was
         confirmed by the Senate on 27 January 1801 and served until
         his death on 6 July 1835. In addition to hearing 1,215 cases
         and authoring 514 opinions, Marshall also wrote, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Life of George Washington</title>,
         a book in 5 volumes. Marshall was buried in New Burying
         Ground, Richmond, Virginia.</p>

         correspondence with his wife, Mary Willis (Ambler) Marshall,
         other family members, James Monroe, Joseph Story, Bushrod
         Washington, and others. The correspondence reflects Marshall's

                <p>Discusses politics and report of Mr. [?]
                        Chesnut that the Democratic Party in South
                        Carolina would unquestionably support him
                        [Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]; the late
                        convention at New York confided that "unless
                        this point can be gained...we [the Federalists]
                        shall again miscarry;" no times have been more
                        perilous than the present because of the
                        internal changes wrought "by a party always
                        hostile to our constitution" and because of
                        even greater external threats; if the present
                        foreign policy with France is continued, the
                        United States "will soon become an empty name"
                        and will no longer be independent; has spent
                        his time on agricultural pursuits instead of
                        professional duty, and scarcely ever reads a
                        newspaper, but the nation's troubles are too
                        serious for him to continue to do so; the
                        Virginia Federalists may win three or four
                        seats in the next Congress, but there is no
                        hope for the presidential election.</p>
