      <p><emph render="bold">Brown Family</emph><lb/>Henry Brown 
         <emph render="super">1</emph>(1716-1766) was born in Bedford
         County, Virginia. He married Alice Beard and had eleven
         children including; Capt. Henry Brown (1760-1841), and Daniel
         Brown (1770-1818).</p>
      <p>Henry Brown 
         <emph render="super">2</emph>(1760-1841), later commissioned
         as a Captain, was wounded in the Revolutionary War. After the
         war he opened a store in New London, Bedford (later Campbell)
         County with his brother, Daniel. He had a full and interesting
         life in mercantile pursuits, being involved in several
         ventures with other partners, and spending a good deal of his
         time in court collecting debts. He acted as Federal Tax
         Collector in Bedford County, 1800-1803, a deputy inspector of
         revenue and served several terms as a Sheriff. He was also a
         treasurer of the New London Academy Meeting House and the New
         London Agricultural Society. New London is in present day
         Campbell County, Virginia. His business and personal papers
         present a picture of the successful business man of that day.
         No letters written by Captain Henry Brown are in this
         collection, though many references to letters he had written
         are to be found. Capt. Henry Brown (1760-1841), married
         Frances Thompson (1775-1822). Their children included Henry
         Brown, Jr. (1797-1836), who married Eleanor Tucker; Samuel T.
         Brown, who married Lissie Huger; 
         <abbr expan="Locky T. Brown">Locky [Lockie] T. Brown</abbr>(b.
         1827), who married Alexander Irvine; Frances Brown, who
         married Edwin Robinson; Alice Brown, who married William M.
         Worthington; and John Thompson Brown (1802-1836), who married
         Mary E. Willcox.</p>
      <p>Many papers of Henry Brown, Jr. 
         <emph render="super">3</emph>(1797-1836), are included in this
         collection, but his personality makes little impression on the
         reader. Toward the end of his short life he served in his
         father's store in Lynchburg, later opening a store of his own.
         Henry Brown Jr. married Eleanor Tucker. He died of an illness
         that had plagued him from his early years.</p>
      <p>John Thompson Brown 
         <emph render="super">3</emph>(1802-1836) was born near Bedford
         County, Virginia. He was a graduate of Princeton who later
         read law under Judge Creed Taylor. John became a member of the
         House of Delegates from Clarksburg, Harrison County, Virginia
         (later West Virginia), at the age of 26. Following his
         marriage in 1830 to Mary E. Willcox, daughter of a leading
         citizen of Petersburg, he was elected to the House of
         Delegates. His speeches to the House of Delegates on slavery,
         states rights, and politics in the Jackson and post-Jackson
         period exist in pamphlet form and are valuable for their
         insight into the position taken by Virginians in this period.
         He also served as member of the Virginia Constitutional
         Convention from 1829-1830. At the age of 29 he was mentioned
         as a possible candidate for U.S. Senator (appointed by the
         State legislature at the time), and undoubtedly would have
         been an important figure in national politics if he had not
         suffered an untimely death at the age of 34. He and Mary
         Willcox had three children; Henry Peronneau Brown (1832-1894),
         John Willcox Brown (b. 1833), and Col. John Thompson Brown II
         (1835-1864).</p>
      <p>Col. John Thompson Brown II 
         <emph render="super">4</emph>(1835-1864), was less than two
         years old when his father died. He lived to carry out his
         father's ideas in the next generation when the debate
         regarding state rights and slavery came to be settled by
         recourse to arms. His fiery speeches contributed to the war
         fever, a war in which he rose to the rank of Colonel in the
         artillery before being killed by a sniper's bullet on May 6,
         1864.</p>
      <p>Henry Peronneau Brown 
         <emph render="super">4</emph>(1832-1894), was named after a
         Princeton schoolmate and close friend of his father's,
         Peronneau Finley, of Charleston, South Carolina. Henry
         Peronneau Brown lived briefly with his namesake after his
         father's death. The correspondence of Henry Peronneau Brown
         with his wife and their relatives, is chiefly of value for the
         insight it gives into family affairs during the Civil War and
         the Reconstruction. Henry Peronneau Brown (1832- 1894),
         married France Bland Coalter (1835-1894), in 1858. They were
         the parents of John Thompson Brown III (b. 1861), who married
         Cassie Dallas Tucker Brown (fl.1898), reuniting the Tucker
         family with the line. They in turn had five children; John
         Thompson Brown IV (b. 1896); Frances Bland Coalter Brown;
         Henry Peronneau Brown III; Charles Brown; Elizabeth Dallas
         Brown; and Willcox Brown.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Coalter Family</emph><lb/>John Coalter 
         <emph render="super">1</emph>(1769-1838), was born in 1769 to
         parents Michael Coalter and Elizabeth Moore. While his father
         was away serving in the war against the British, John Coalter
         and his brothers worked the family farm on Walker's Creek in
         Rockbridge County, Virginia. After brief schooling he became
         tutor to the children of St. George Tucker (1752-1827), and
         Frances (Bland) Randolph Tucker (d.1788). Following the death
         of Mrs. Tucker, Coalter moved with the family to Williamsburg,
         serving without pay in return for the legal training he
         received from Judge St. George Tucker (1752-1827). While
         studying law, he also attended lectures at the College of
         William and Mary under Bp. James Madison and George Wythe. In
         December 1790, he received his license to practice law. A year
         later he married Maria Rind, the orphaned daughter of a
         Williamsburg printer, who had been serving as governess for
         the Tucker children. After the death of Maria Rind Coalter
         (d.1792), in childbirth, he married (1795), Margaret Davenport
         (d. 1795), of Williamsburg, who also died in childbirth within
         the year. Ann Frances Bland Tucker (1785-1813), daughter of
         St. George Tucker, was taken as his third wife in 1802. John
         Coalter had been her tutor twelve years before. She later bore
         him his only three children, Frances Lelia Coalter
         (1803-1822), Elizabeth Tucker Coalter Bryan (1805-1853), and
         St. George Tucker Coalter (1809- 1839). John Coalter later
         became a Circuit Judge of the Virginia General Court and
         bought "Elm Grove," an estate in Staunton, Virginia. Coalter
         continued to live there until 1811, at which time he moved to
         Richmond to serve as Judge of the Circuit Court of Appeals. In
         1822, Coalter took his fourth wife, the widow Hannah (Jones)
         Williamson. In his latter years he enjoyed wide holdings and
         interests, including a lively concern with gold mining in
         Virginia. John Tucker Coalter died at "Chatham" plantation in
         Stafford County, Virginia, 1838.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Tucker Coalter 
         <emph render="super">2</emph>(1805-1853), married John
         Randolph Bryan (godson of John Randolph of Roanoke) in 1831
         and lived at Eagle Point, Gloucester County, Virginia. They
         had nine children; John Coalter Bryan (1831-1853), Delia
         Bryan, (d. 1833), Frances Tucker Bryan (b. 1835), Randolph
         Bryan (b. 1837), Georgia Screven Bryan (b. 1839), St. George
         Tucker Bryan (b. 1843), Joseph Bryan (b. 1847), Thomas Forman
         Bryan (1848-1851), Corbin Braxton Bryan (b. 1852).</p>
      <p>St. George Tucker Coalter 
         <emph render="super">2</emph>(1809-1839), married the
         strong-willed Judith Harrison Tomlin (1808-1859). He lived out
         his life fighting sickness and the losing battle of making his
         farm profitable. Judith Harrison Tomlin collected letters,
         which included many exchanged by the fourteen cousins (nine
         Bryans and five Coalters). Though none of these people were
         prominent on the large canvas of life, their collected letters
         give an interesting and informative picture of life in
         Virginia in the first half of the nineteenth century. St.
         George and Judith Coalter had six children; Walker Tomlin
         Coalter (1830-1831); John Coalter (1831-1883); Henry Tucker
         (1833-1870); Ann Frances Bland Coalter (1835-1894), who
         married Henry Peronneau Brown (1832-1894), in 1858; Virginia
         Braxton Coalter (b. 1837), who married William. P. Braxton in
         1855; and St. George Tucker Coalter (b. 1839), who married
         Amelia Downy in 1862 and Charlotte (Downy) Terrill in 1868.

      <p><emph render="bold">Tucker Family</emph><lb/>St. George Tucker 
         <emph render="super">1</emph>(1752-1827), was born in 1752
         near Port Royal, Bermuda to Ann Butterfield Tucker and Henry
         Tucker, a merchant. St. George Tucker had a extensive career
         in law starting with his acceptance to the College of William
         and Mary under the tutelage of George Wythe in 1771. He served
         as clerk of courts of Dinwiddlie County, 1774; commonwealth
         attorney for Chesterfield County, 1783-1786; law professor at
         the College of William and Mary, 1790; and federal court judge
         for Virginia, 1813-1825. In 1771, he married Frances (Bland)
         Randolph, a widow, who had three children from a previous
         marriage; Richard Randolph, Theodorick Randolph (d. 1792), and
         John Randolph of Roanoke. St. George and Frances Randolph
         Tucker together, had five children; Henry St. George Tucker
         (1780-1848), Tudor Tucker, Ann Frances Bland Tucker
         (1785-1813), Elizabeth Tucker (b. 1788), and Nathaniel
         Beverley Tucker (1784-1851). They lived on the Randolph
         plantation, "Mattoax" in Chesterfield County, Virginia, until
         the death of France Randolph Tucker in 1813. In 1791, St.
         George remarried the widow Lelia Skipwith Carter (fl. 1795).
         None of their three children lived to adulthood.</p>
      <p>Henry St. George Tucker 
         <emph render="super">2</emph>(1780-1848), served as a
         professor of law at the University of Virginia; in the

         1815-1819; and in the Virginia Senate, 1819-1824. He married
         Anne Evelina Hunter in 1806 and had at least eleven children,
         including; Randolph Tucker, Dr. David Hunter Tucker, Frances
         Tucker, Mary Tucker, Virginia Tucker, Anne Tucker, and John

         <lb/>A friend of John Tucker Coalter's (1769-1838), from his
         Williamsburg days, William Munford, a poet and lawyer of some
         note, wrote letters to Coalter which contain interesting
         reports of the College of William and Mary and of Harvard
         University. He wrote of the poverty stricken French immigrants
         in Norfolk, and sent vivid descriptions of the activity of the
         British fleet in the Chesapeake Bay during the War of 1812. He
         lived and studied with George Wythe in Williamsburg, later
         moving with him to Richmond to serve as his clerk. His remarks
         on Wythe, for whom he had a great affection, throw light on
         that important member of the legal profession in the new
         nation.</p>
      <p>Gary A. Adams' (fl. 1900), connection to the family is

                     genealogical charts of the Tucker, Coalter, Tomlin
                     and Brown families, and sundry genealogical notes
                     which form a preface to the collection, are placed
                     at the beginning of this box. The collection
                     begins with 54 poems, the first of which is signed
                     by St. George Tucker. Two signed poems by William
                     Munford are included. The largest group of poems
                     are those exchanged by John Coalter and Maria
                     Rind, his first wife. Others were collected in the
                     family papers until the middle or the latter part
                     of the nineteenth century.</p>
              <p>The bulk of the material in Box 1 concerns John
                     Coalter: an autobiographical sketch written by him
                     on his 18th birthday, and letters covering the
                     period of his early life from 1787, when he went
                     to live with the St. George Tucker family, until
                     the death of his first wife in 1793. Interesting
                     letters from John Munford, a classmate of Coalter,
                     are included, several of which concern the College
                     of William and Mary and Harvard College.</p>

              <p>Interesting comments on the effect of the
                     embargo in South Carolina, and of episodes in the
                     War of 1812 in the Chesapeake Bay area are found
                     in these letters. There is also a report of the
                     destruction wrought in Bruton Parish Church by the
                     "youth of Williamsburg," and remarks of Saint
                     George Tucker (14 June 1809) upon the occasion of
                     the birth of his first grandson, St. George
                     Coalter, in which he strongly condemns the
                     academies and colleges of that day.</p>
              <p>Letters include those exchanged by John Coalter
                     with his third wife Frances Bland (Tucker) Coalter
                     from 1809-1811, when John Coalter was serving as
                     Circuit Judge. In 1811 he accepted an appointment
                     as judge of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals;
                     the family then moved to Richmond. There are many
                     letters received by Mrs. Frances Bland Tucker
                     Coalter between 1809 and her death in 1813, from
                     her father St. George Tucker, and stepmother Mrs.
                     Lelia Tucker, in Williamsburg, from her
                     sister-in-law Mrs. Judith Randolph at Bizarre, and
                     from other members of the family. There also are
                     many letters to the daughters of John Coalter,
                     Frances Lelia and Elizabeth Tucker, from their
                     grandparents, from 1813 to the death of Frances
                     Lelia Coalter in 1821.</p>

                <p>In the letter of June 14, St. George Tucker
                        mentions the birth of John Coalter's first son
                        his first grandson (St. George Tucker Coalter)
                        "who, if my prayers for him may be heard, will
                        never descend from the dignity of a private
                        station." Concerning the education of his
                        grandson, he writes, "unless the manners of our
                        youth, or the management of their tutor, shall
                        undergo a most surprising and happy change in
                        this Country, I had rather he should never hear
                        of an Academy or a College, than enter the

                <p>This series of letters is concerned, among
                        other problems, with the difficulty of meeting
                        payments on Elm Grove, of a fight between two
                        of their slaves, the treatment of one of the
                        wives by slave husband and the imprisonment on
                        the plantation of the two slaves. Effort to get
                        a tooth pulled. Two doctors and, finally, "a
                        shoemaker named Cease" were able to extract the
                        tooth about a week after the first attempt was
                        made. Alcoholism of a friend. Afflicting
                        account of sister's situation at Bizarre. "she
                        must come to us, as soon as she can leave
                        Bizarre; which she says cannot be before Xmas,
                        that she may complete the clothing of the
                        Negroes."</p>

                <p>The troubled times are reflected in this
                        series of letters. In July, Tucker comments on
                        the American privateer with one nine-pounder
                        which took a British schooner armed with four
                        twelve pounders. In August he gives an account
                        of the Baltimore riot in which a jail was
                        broken into and prisoners assassinated. He
                        writes that such action "is beyond measure
                        horrible and obnoxious; and every good Citizen
                        ought to set his face against such damnable
                        proceedings," but concludes, "The Yankees, no
                        doubt, will be glad of the precedent...I look
                        forward to a dissolution of the Union, as an
                        Event not far off."</p>

                        Frances L. Coalter, the sister of Elizabeth T.
                        Coalter, died in 1821 at the age of 18. John
                        Coalter was soon to marry his fourth wife, a
                        widow Williamson.</p>

              <p>The letters in this box are primarily those of
                     the two surviving children of John and Francis
                     Bland Tucker Coalter: Elizabeth Tucker Coalter
                     Bryan and St. George Tucker Coalter, and their
                     respective spouses, John Randolph Bryan and Judith
                     H. Tomlin Coalter.</p>
              <p>This group includes genealogical material on
                     the Tomlin family, and correspondence of Judith H.
                     Tomlin before her marriage to St. George Tucker
                     Coalter. Her letters form an important part of the
                     collection from this time until her death in
                     1859.</p>
              <p>The last letters from their grandparents, Mr.
                     and Mrs. St. George Tucker, are preserved, as well
                     as letters to their uncles Henry and Beverley
                     Tucker and John Randolph of Roanoke. Of special
                     note is a letter of October, 1831 in which St.
                     George Tucker Coalter writes fully of Randolph
                     during a visit to Roanoke. After his death in
                     1833, Randolph's will caused great difficulty and
                     misunderstanding in the family, and appears to
                     cast a slur on his step-father St. George
                     Tucker.</p>
              <p>The letters of St. George Tucker Coalter to his
                     wife and sister, especially those written from the
                     springs which he visits each year, form the
                     largest single group. In these letters an
                     interesting picture of nineteenth century social
                     life is to be found.</p>

                     the nine children of Mrs. Elizabeth T. Bryan add
                     to the correspondence as the years go on, for the
                     families are very attached to one another and
                     there is much visiting back and forth as well as
                     letter writing. The letters of the cousins have
                     been combined in this collection, so that an
                     interesting picture is given of the life of this
                     period; see a report of a traveling entertainer
                     who visits the great houses (23 February 1847), a
                     description of a costume ball at Warner Hall (8
                     February 1851) and a list of courses studied at a
                     Girl's school (2 February 1852).</p>
              <p>There is much discussion of diseases which were
                     prevalent: consumption, scarlet fever, typhoid
                     fever, cholera, and influenza. 16-year-old John
                     Coalter copied out a cholera cure sent by his aunt
                     for use by two local doctors (13 July 1849).</p>

            <p>This box consists largely of papers collected by
                  Frances Bland Coalter between February 1853, when she
                  is preparing to leave school, and December 1858, when
                  she married Henry Peronneau Brown. Through this
                  marriage the Tucker-Coalter line was connected with
                  the Brown line; thus, the papers of the two families
                  were brought together into one.</p>
            <p>The collection gives an interesting picture of the
                  life and interests of a young lady of moderate
                  circumstances in the mid-l9th century. Of special
                  interest are the letters concerning the Rev. Moses D.
                  Hoge, whose school in Richmond Fanny Coalter had
                  attended. Shortly after she left school, the Rev. Mr.
                  Hoge carried on a very romantic correspondence with
                  Fanny, although he was a married man with several
                  children. The correspondence became more ardent in
                  the early months of 1854 and, when Mrs. Hoge wrote
                  that her husband had gone to Baltimore to stay with
                  his brother who was ill, Fanny followed him there.
                  According to the gossip of Mattie and Lizzie Morton,
                  she went there to "entrap him." In October it was
                  suggested that the brother, William Hoge, was the one
                  in whom she was interested. The Rev. Mr. Hoge later
                  sought to calm the fervours of his correspondent, as
                  shown by his letters of 28 January 1855, 19 June
                  1856, and 19 March 1857.</p>
            <p>Fanny B. Coalter did not lack for other suitors,
                  however, for she preserved a letter of 17 July 1854,
                  a proposal of marriage from Alfred B. Tucker. A year
                  later there are reports of her interest in the Brown
                  brothers, John Thompson and Peronneau, of Petersburg,
                  both of whom were courting her. She finally settled
                  on the latter; some acceptances to the marriage
                  invitation are included in this box.</p>
            <p>Letters of Frances Bland Coalter and her husband
                  Henry Peronneau Brown continue in Box 21. The
                  intervening boxes contain manuscripts of the Brown
                  family, especially Capt. Henry Brown, grandfather of
                  Henry Peronneau Brown (Boxes 7-13); the Hon. John
                  Thompson Brown, father of Henry Peronneau Brown
                  (Boxes 14-19); and Col. John Thompson Brown II,
                  brother of Henry Peronneau Brown (Box 20).</p>

              <p>The Brown family papers begin with the letters
                     and papers of Capt. Henry Brown (1760-1841),
                     successful merchant of Bedford County and
                     Lynchburg, who established the family fortune. He
                     was the father of John Thompson Brown, Delegate to
                     the Virginia Assembly, whose letters and papers
                     are collected in the next section (Boxes
                     14-19).</p>
              <p>A few letters and receipts pertaining to Henry
                     Brown, 1712-1798, the father of Capt. Henry Brown,
                     are included. The great bulk of the material,
                     however, relates to Capt. Brown, beginning with a
                     map of a Revolutionary War battle, 1777, in which
                     he was wounded. With his brother, Daniel, he
                     opened a general store in Bedford soon after the
                     conclusion of the war. A partnership agreement of
                     April 1797, which brought James Leftwich into the
                     business, is preserved and the bulk of the
                     material in this box pertains to the business of
                     the store. A good picture of early merchandising
                     is given by the accounts, letters relating to
                     buying and selling trips, and the court actions
                     taken to collect accounts.</p>
              <p>Also, starting with folder 60, are 39 items
                     relating to the duties of Henry Brown as tax
                     collector in the Bedford area in the years 1800 to
                     1803.</p>

                     Pleasant Murphy. All notes of the period carried a
                     100 percent penalty clause. This resulted in many
                     law suits being brought to establish what would
                     now be considered exorbitant claims. In one case
                     (see entry for March 10, 1823) for a debt of
                     $42.05, the debtor surrendered 1 sound filly, 2
                     cows, a calf, 2 feather beds, all household and
                     kitchen furniture, all plantation utensils, and 6
                     hogs!</p>

            <p>Letters of Henry Brown, Jr., oldest son of Capt.
                  Henry Brown; Samuel Thompson Brown, youngest son; and
                  other members of the immediate family.</p>
            <p>Henry Brown, Jr., who suffered a grave illness in
                  1822 as a result of which he almost lost his
                  eyesight, went into the partnership of his father
                  with Amman Hancock. In 1835-1836, he opened his own
                  store in Lynchburg, but died in May 1836, while on a
                  buying trip to New York. Interesting items in this
                  part of the collection include a 44 page book of
                  mineral and chemical notes (31 July 1826), a 56 page
                  diary kept by Henry Brown, Jr. on his trip abroad (24
                  July 1831), drafts of letters by Henry Brown, Jr. to
                  newspapers regarding horses, and instructions for
                  horse care, and the like (13 April 1835-March 1836).
                  The will of Henry Brown, Jr. (May-December 1830), and
                  his deathbed statement dictated to his wife (May
                  1836), are also included.</p>
            <p>The papers of Samuel Thompson Brown include the
                  card which announced the opening of his law office in
                  Bedford (8 May 1838), records of his marriage in
                  Alabama (27 April 1840), and the death of his wife
                  within the year (3 April 1841). A letter of 22
                  January 1842, mentions the business failures taking
                  place in Richmond and Lynchburg, and one of 27 August
                  of the same year comments on the national political
                  situation which is "sadly out of joint." In a letter
                  of 20 September [1845], there is a report of "the
                  thefts which were perpetrated by Thomas H. Benton
                  whilst a student at Chapel Hill."</p>

            <p>John Thompson Brown (1802-1836) was born at Otter
                  Hills, near Bedford, Virginia and was the son of
                  Henry Brown (1760-1841). He attended the New London
                  Academy, 1816; studied at Princeton, 1817-1820;
                  traveled to the South and the West Indies, 1821; and
                  studied law with Judge Creed Taylor in Cumberland
                  County, Virginia, 1822-1823. He began his law
                  practice in Clarksburg, Virginia (later West
                  Virginia), in 1824, and represented Harrison County
                  in the House of Delegates, 1827-1830. He was a member
                  of the Virginia Constitutional Convention of
                  1829-1830. He married Mary E. Willcox June, 1830, and
                  moved to Petersburg, where he again was elected to
                  the General Assembly, 1831-1836. He was a delegate to
                  the national convention of the Republican (now
                  Democratic) Party, but died on 20 November 1836, at
                  his father's home, Otter Hills, after a brief
                  illness.</p>
            <p>The first two letters in Box 14 date from the
                  period of his attendance at New London Academy; then
                  follow the papers relating to Princeton, where he
                  matriculated in 1817 at the age of 19. He was placed
                  in the Sophomore Class on the basis of an examination
                  before the faculty, and received the highest mark
                  given at the College, in each of the three years he
                  spent at the College. His report sheets show the
                  requirements for entrance, lists of courses, and
                  contain a resolution passed by the trustees which
                  condemned the sharp practices of the merchants in
                  town.</p>
            <p>Some of the correspondence of John Thompson Brown
                  with his brother-in-law Dr. William B. Steptoe in
                  this period is interesting for the comments it
                  contains on the Missouri question and other matters
                  then being debated in the U.S. Senate. The remarks
                  made by John Thompson Brown in letters from his
                  collegiate period may be compared with his statements
                  on the subject of slavery later made on the floor of
                  the House of Delegates.</p>
            <p>After graduating from Princeton, John Thompson
                  Brown traveled to the South, and made a brief trip to
                  the West Indies, keeping notes on his impressions.
                  Upon his return he took up the study of law with
                  Judge Taylor. From this period come interesting
                  musings on such subjects as "the family fireside,"
                  "youthful recollection," "friendship," and "behavior
                  of a lawyer if he is to succeed." His license to
                  practice law, dated 7 March 1824, is included in the
                  collection. He journeyed to Clarksburg, Virginia, to
                  set up his law practice, and kept a notebook on the
                  trip West which reveal his first impressions of the
                  Clarksburg area.</p>
            <p>At the end of this box is a scrapbook containing
                  some of his published writings, speeches, and
                  newspaper articles.</p>

            <p>The material in this box covers the period 1825 to
                  1829, when John Thompson Brown was resident of
                  Clarksburg, Harrison County, Virginia (later West
                  Virginia). In this period John Thompson Brown wrote
                  some of the "Letters to the Editor," printed in the
                  Clarksburg 
                  <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Enquirer</title>, contained in
                  the scrap book noted above in Box 14. A draft of a
                  part of the letter concerning the poverty of Mr.
                  Jefferson is to be found in this box (1825).</p>
            <p>In July 1826, John Thompson Brown wrote to his
                  brother Henry Brown, Jr. of his aim to run for the
                  U.S. Congress. In 1827 he was elected to the House of
                  Delegates; he was re-elected in 1828 and 1829. This
                  box also contains various printed and manuscript
                  material touching upon his career in the General
                  Assembly.</p>
            <p>By the end of 1829, John Thompson Brown had
                  established himself in Clarksburg, built a house, and
                  planned to buy into a partnership in a store to
                  advance his financial position. In a letter of March
                  23, 1829 he mentions his desire to run in the next
                  election for the U.S. Congress.</p>

              <p>In February, he forwards a copy of sheriff's
                     commission to his father. During the year he
                     borrows $400.00 for payments on his house in
                     Clarksburg, and by the end of the year his father
                     has agreed to advance enough capital for him to
                     become a partner in a mercantile business. Upon
                     the conclusion of the 1828-1829 session of the
                     General Assembly, he writes that he will be a
                     candidate once more, then run for Congress. In the
                     letter of March 23rd, he writes that opposition
                     has arisen "on account of some laws we had passed
                     last session authorizing the county court to levy
                     a tax for repairing roads and, bridges." On March
                     23rd he relates his experiences in Washington at
                     the inauguration of Jackson: on December 14th he
                     predicts that the basis of votes for whites will
                     be surrendered in the formation of the new State
                     constitution.</p>

            <p>The change which was to occur in the life and
                  fortunes of John Thompson Brown in the year 1830 is
                  forecast in the first letter of this box, a letter
                  received by Mary E. Willcox of Petersburg in
                  [December] 1829, in which there is a discussion of
                  "Mr. B." Three months later (18 March 1830) in a
                  letter to his father, John Thompson Brown announces
                  his intention of leaving Clarksburg, and of his need
                  for a horse and sulky so that he may arrive in
                  Petersburg in a manner which should "avoid the
                  appearance of poverty and destitution." The next
                  letter in the collection (9 [May] 1830), in draft,
                  contains an account of his wedding, a wedding which
                  was attended by no members of his immediate
                  family.</p>
            <p>Subsequent letters tell of the generosity of the
                  new father-in-law John V. Willcox in the gift of a
                  town house "provided with servants," a draft of
                  $1500, and the promise of as much more as he asks (22
                  July 1830). Yet the position is not satisfactory and
                  because John Thompson Brown feels that he is losing
                  his independence, he returns to Clarksburg with the
                  intention of resettling there and sending for his
                  wife (2 May 1831). During a four week visit to
                  Harrison County, he finds his political position has
                  declined (7 June 1831), so he returns to Petersburg,
                  and is invited to make the Independence Day address
                  for the town (8 June 1831). As a result of this
                  address (and the good influence of his father-in-law)
                  he is nominated to represent the town in the House of
                  Delegates, and is elected without opposition (26
                  September 1831).</p>
            <p>He successfully sponsors a bill in the Assembly
                  for the Petersburg Railroad (28 December 1831), is
                  appointed Judge of Elections for the Petersburg
                  Office of the Bank of Virginia (29 December 1831),
                  and is sought as a sponsor of a new newspaper which
                  is being established in Richmond (20 October 1831).
                  Of particular interest is a letter to his nephew
                  outlining his philosophy of life and advising the
                  young man on his future (3 October 1831). A report of
                  the slave insurrection in Southhampton is described
                  in a letter of 26 September 1831.</p>
            <p>At the end of this box are collected more than a
                  hundred drafts of toasts made by John Thompson
                  Brown.</p>

            <p>The important and exciting national political
                  events of the years 1832 and 1833, as they affected
                  the people of Virginia, are seen through the eyes of
                  John Thompson Brown in the items included in this
                  box. A member from Petersburg in the House of
                  Delegates of the Virginia Assembly, John Thompson
                  Brown was placed in a position of leadership and
                  strongly influenced the decisions taken in those
                  critical years.</p>
            <p>His speech on the abolition of slavery was
                  considered so important that Judge Henry St. George
                  Tucker and others raised the money to have it printed
                  (18 January 1832). He was a member of the Virginia
                  delegation to the national convention of the
                  Republican Party; his resolution of the
                  Vice-Presidential nominee (21-22 May 1832) was the
                  one adopted by the Virginia caucus. As Chairman of
                  the Finance Committee of the House of Delegates, the
                  question of President Jackson's moves against the
                  United States Bank was of particular concern to him
                  (9 April 1833).</p>
            <p>Great excitement was aroused by South Carolina's
                  threat of nullification. John Thompson Brown was a
                  member of the Committee on Federal Relations, and his
                  substitute motion on the question is included in this
                  box, as well as his speech on 
                  <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The State of the Relations

                  delivered 5 January 1833, also published in pamphlet

            <p>John Thompson Brown was invited to be a Director
                  of the Petersburg Railroad which he declined (7 May
                  1832), and was considered for the position of U.S.
                  Senator, although he felt that he was not qualified
                  by years or experience (December 1832). An
                  interesting report of his meeting with President
                  Jackson is included in a letter from John Thompson
                  Brown to his wife (23 May 1832).</p>
            <p>Also included in this box are letters from John
                  Tyler, William Cabell Rives, and William Segar Archer
                  (7 February, 3 March 1833).</p>
            <p>Two poems, possibly written by John Thompson
                  Brown, clipped from a newspaper, signed Julian are
                  included at the end of this box.</p>

              <p>In the letter of December 3 he discusses the
                     election of U.S. Senators, stating that Mr. Leigh
                     is out because of his opposition to President
                     Jackson. Among those mentioned for the position

              <p>After stating his opposition to protective
                     tariffs, John Thompson Brown argued that they
                     result from "a perversion of the spirit and intent
                     of the Constitution, rather than a violation of
                     its literal principles."</p>
              <p>He compliments the Chief Magistrate of the
                     United States on his general policy but disputes
                     the Proclamation of the President on other
                     grounds, basing his argument on 
                     <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Law of
                     Nations</title>by E. de Vattel.</p>
              <p>As to the action of South Carolina, he contends
                     that there is no possibility of nullification
                     under the Constitution, but that the redress of
                     the wrong done in the tariff act must come by
                     recourse to the Supreme Court, to the "Co-states"
                     acting in Congress, and if necessary, by an
                     amendment to the Constitution.</p>

            <p>The letters written by John Thompson Brown during
                  portions of the 1833-1834 and the 1834-1835 sessions
                  of the General Assembly are found in this box.</p>
            <p>The manuscripts begin with letters reporting the
                  legislative battle fought and lost against the
                  Portsmouth-Norfolk road which John Thompson Brown
                  believed would have disastrous effects on the future
                  of Petersburg (January 1834). Near the end of the box
                  are letters concerning John Thompson Brown's battle
                  fought with fists and canes in the halls of the State
                  Capitol with a fellow representative John Hampden
                  Pleasants (January 1835). The fracas resulted from a
                  heated debate on the election of a U.S. Senator. John
                  Thompson Brown was one of those mentioned for the
                  position of U.S. Senator (December 1834), but his
                  youth (28 years) was against him and he did not enjoy
                  the rough and tumble of party politics then
                  developing.</p>
            <p>Also of interest are the draft of a speech
                  delivered on the occasion of the death of Lafayette
                  (9 July 1834), and two notebooks used by John
                  Thompson Brown as Chairman of the Finance Committee
                  of the House of Delegates (January 1835).</p>

            <p>The closing sessions of the State Legislature of
                  1834-1835 are reported in the letters at the
                  beginning of this box. The party spirit runs high in
                  Petersburg as the "Jackson party" opposes John
                  Thompson Brown (March 1835). He is involved in a
                  street fight with an opponent in which he receives a
                  black eye, but the argument is made up after he wins
                  the election (April 1835).</p>
            <p>Before the next session of the legislature, John
                  Thompson Brown is occupied in collecting more
                  material on the question of slavery (August 1835),
                  and prepared three long drafts written in opposition
                  to the candidacy of Martin Van Buren for President of
                  the U.S. Undated drafts of notes on legal cases are
                  included at the end of the 1835 section.</p>
            <p>Henry Brown, Jr., the brother of John Thompson
                  Brown, died in May 1836, while on a buying trip to
                  Philadelphia and New York for his Lynchburg store.
                  The trip of John Thompson Brown to meet the body of
                  his brother, and his activity in settling his
                  brother's affairs in Lynchburg are reported in the
                  letters included in this box.</p>
            <p>At the end of July he takes his family to his
                  father's home, Otter Hills, near New London in
                  Campbell County, for the funeral sermon of Henry
                  Brown, Jr. While there he contracts an illness which
                  keeps him there until his death on 26 November
                  1836.</p>

              <p>Reports on the stocktaking in the store of
                     Henry Brown, Jr. On July 19 he wrote that he was

                     hear his brother's funeral preached. This is the
                     last letter from John Thompson Brown to his
                     father, for on that visit to Otter Hills he was
                     taken with the illness from which he died.</p>

            <p>This box contains the papers from the period after
                  the death of John Thompson Brown, and concern John
                  Thompson Brown II, born in 1835, some 18 months
                  before the death of his father.</p>
            <p>One letter (20 November 1844) lists the courses
                  studied by boys at the ages of 9, 11, and 13; a
                  travel book gives an interesting picture of Europe (4
                  May 1857); and a draft of a letter describes the
                  bleedings to which a tourist entering Italy had to
                  submit.</p>
            <p>John Thompson Brown II was elected Second
                  Lieutenant by the members of his company (1 December
                  1859). Also included are notes of speeches made to
                  rouse war enthusiasm. The receipt for a saber and
                  belt (23 April 1861) mark the beginning of action,
                  and other records follow John Thompson Brown II's
                  rise to Major, then to Colonel. His request for a
                  transfer to a more active field of war and an
                  extended argument with his commanding officer, Brig.
                  Gen. William Nelson Pendleton, are of interest. The
                  box concludes with items which appear to have been on
                  the person of Col. John Thompson Brown II, when he
                  was killed in action on 6 May 1864.</p>

            <p>Papers relating to the oldest son of John Thompson
                  Brown, Henry Peronneau Brown, begin with letters
                  written by his mother Mrs. Mary E. Brown. She
                  expresses concern that her son is more interested in
                  affairs other than his studies (1 March 1849). His
                  school career is traced briefly through his years at
                  the University of Virginia (28 June 1851).</p>
            <p>The letters exchanged between Henry Peronneau
                  Brown and his fiancee, Frances Baland Coalter, 1858,
                  lead into the family correspondence which completes
                  this box. (Other letters of Frances Bland Coalter and
                  her family are found in Box 6, Coalter and Tucker
                  Papers.)</p>
            <p>From May, 1861, all letters are concerned with the
                  war. Letters written by John Coalter II, to his
                  sister Mrs. Henry Peronneau Brown in 1878 give a
                  graphic picture of the struggle made by a southern
                  farmer to re-establish himself after the war.</p>
