					<p>Flip notepad within a cover entitled “The Handy Scratch-Pad,” June 1935 to August 1936. The notepad begins June 18, 1935 on a trip from Chicago, Illinois to Ogdensburg via Ohio and New York and a visit with family. It appears that Chicago is the family’s home. The author sees the ferry from Port Kent as it travels across Lake Champlain to Burlington, Vermont.  The author then travels to Auburn and secures housing. She talks of the crew being delayed because of rain and their activities around Auburn. She, her family and crew go somewhere near the Alleghany River.  In August, they move near Dayton, Ohio then through the Alleghany Mountains to Soloman. On September 20, they leave for Lafayette, Indiana.  In October, they return to Chicago for an operation for Pauline then go to Tulsa, Oklahoma. On December 21, they move to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma then Shawnee, Oklahoma. In January to April 1935, they move to Tuskegee then Springfield, Missouri, Mt. Grove, Missouri, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, Piqua, Ohio and Dayton, Ohio.  In August, they visit family in Chicago. During all of the travels she describes the trips and the towns, and tells of their daily activities. Her social life includes contract bridge, movies, dining at restaurants and shopping. She provides the title of each movie she sees. Her daily activities include washing dishes, cleaning, ironing, reading and cooking.  She calls their group “gypsies.” Her companions and/or family are Nat, Pauline, Nester, Clarence and Dave.  She has glued in a few items such as photographs, postcards and the new tax tokens used in Oklahoma.  She does not mention the nature of the work of the men, but it is affected by the unusual amount of rain during 1935.</p>
