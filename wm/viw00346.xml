	<head>Scope and Contents</head>
	<p>Based on information gathered by Special Collections staff in 2011, there appear to be three possible creators of the ledger: William Tandy Burrus (1766 or 1776-1831), WTB (?-prior to 1836?), or William Stevens (1773-1843).	 	The ledger (200 pp., 15 pages are missing in the front, several pages are missing in back, and several halves of pages are missing) records transactions for miscellaneous merchandise, wheat and tobacco. The contra page shows payments were mostly made in cash, but are sometimes recorded as &#039;sundries&#039; or other goods.  He also lists Family Expenses on page 92, Household Stuff on page 108, and Bills Receivable on page 134.	The ledger has additional notations beginning on page 194 written in a different handwriting from the original creator, the entries of which include a range of dates between 1883 and 1895.  These entries are consistent with the use of the manuscript as a ledger by the second creator.	A notation on the first page reads &quot;Lancelot Burrus Book, Given to him by his Mother, January 1, 1881.”  Lancelot Burrus was a common name within the Burrus family serving as the name of both the son and grandson of William Tandy Burrus as well as his nephew and great-nephew.	There is also a bookplate in the front of book for William Stevens.  William Stevens was the brother of Elizabeth Stevens who married into the Burrus family.
