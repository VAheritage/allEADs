         <p>William Meade (1789-1862) was born on 11 November 1789 in
         Frederick County, Virginia, the son of Colonel Richard Kidder
         Meade, an aide on General George Washington's staff during the
         Revolution, and Mary Fitzhugh Grymes. He attended a private
         school, Carter Hall, in Virginia and then entered the junior
         class at the College of New Jersey [Princeton University] in
         1806. He graduated in 1808 and was valedictorian of his
         class.</p>
         <p>Meade studied for the ministry of the Episcopal church
         under the Reverend Walter Dulaney Addison, the evangelical
         rector of St. John Parish, Maryland. Before his ordination,
         Meade married Mary Barnwell in 1810. They had three sons
         before her death in 1817. In 1820, he married Thomasia Nelson;
         they had no children.</p>
         <p>Meade was ordained deacon in the Protestant Episcopal
         Church by Bishop James Madison of Virginia on 24 February
         1811. He was ordained priest in the Protestant Episcopal
         Church by Bishop Claggett of Maryland several years later on
         29 January 1818. In 1814, he became the minister for Frederick
         County, and in 1821 he became the rector of Christ Church,
         Winchester. With the help of Bishop Moore and William Holland
         Wilmer, they founded the Protestant Episcopal Seminary in
         Virginia in Alexandria in 1823. Meade was an opponent of
         slavery and was one of the charter members who met in
         Washington, D.C., in December 1816 to organize the American
         Society for the Colonizing the Free People of Color in the
         United States.</p>
         <p>On 29 May 1829 Meade was elected assistant bishop of
         Virginia on the first ballot and was consecrated on 19 August
         1829. He served in this capacity until 12 November 1841, when
         Bishop Moore died and he became the third bishop of Virginia.
         He served in that position until his death.</p>
         <p>Meade was strongly opposed to secession, but when Virginia
         left the Union he supported it. After the North-South split of
         the church, the first preliminary meeting of the dioceses in
         the Confederate States met in Montgomery, Alabama, 3-6 July
         1861, and the second meeting was in Columbia, South Carolina,
         16-24 October 1861. As senior bishop, Meade presided over the
         Convention in South Carolina where they drew up the
         constitution of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the
         Confederate States.</p>
         <p>Meade died on 14 March 1862, in Virginia.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>Correspondence, 1807-1861, of the Right Reverend William
         Meade who was a minister of the Protestant Episcopal Church
         and third Bishop of the Church in Virginia. The early
         correspondence pertains to his studies at Princeton and his
         decision to enter the ministry. Subsequent correspondence
         deals with religious controversy, particularly after his
         election as Assistant Bishop of Virginia in 1829. The
         discipline of clergy and laity and disagreement over doctrinal
         issues form an important part of the collection as well as his
         referral to his concern for the religious instruction of
         slaves. Among his correspondents were Richard Channing Moore,
         William Rollinson Whittingham and J. H. Wingfield.</p>

                  <p>Comments on the art of writing with ease; argues
                  that it is an art mastered only by much labor, and
                  that success in writing is measured by one's ability
                  to conceal the labor involved; reports that Weylie
                  thought Meade was going to study law and that Meade's
                  decision to study Divinity will not bring him worldly
                  wealth, but will afford him great honour as an
                  "Ambassadour from Heaven;" states reasons why Weylie
                  considers himself unfit for the ministry. Weylie
                  congratulates Meade on his decision and expresses

                  said that he had seen the Memphis letter offering him
                  [Jones] the minister's position; Meade notes at
                  bottom that he wrote this because Mr. Jones thought

                  <p>Jones had earlier considered threatening
                  resignation, hoping that the vestry would raise his
                  salary; Meade told him that instead the vestry would
                  accept his resignation; when he finally offered
                  resignation after having secured a position in
                  Memphis, a polite but insincere pleas on the part of
                  some for him to stay almost induced Jones to stay;

                  rector, Meade expresses disapproval because

                  congratulating him on a sermon which Craik published
                  on "Baptismal Regeneration"; supported Craik's view
                  that the operations of the Holy Spirit were not
                  contingent on baptism as supported by the reformers;
                  takes exception to his "restricted an exclusive use
                  of the term "regeneration"; argues that the Holy
                  Spirit bestows gifts sovereignly; concludes that more
                  good would be done concentrating on the Scriptures
                  rather than searching for what the Fathers or
                  Reformers wrote; on the whole, he argues that more
                  success is to be found in preaching the plain Gospel
                  of Christ to perishing sinners.</p>

                  <p>Suggests that Whittingham's proposal for an
                  address to the English Bishops is ill-advised; even
                  though the address would attack the "present assault"
                  of the Roman see on the Church, the call for a
                  convocation therein may aid rather than hinder the
                  tractarians; declares that the American church should
                  be grateful that it is not tied like the English
                  church to be state; the English church could easily
                  argue that the American [Episcopal] church's
                  voluntary system is as open to appeal from Rome as
                  the acts of the preceding [30] years had made the
                  English church vulnerable.</p>

                  <p>Expresses dismay over some of the errors which
                  Wilberforce had fallen into in his History of the
                  American Church, perhaps because of his remarks on
                  slaveholders, to which the Southern Bishops objected;
                  noted that English clergy might come to the General
                  Convention in New York if invited, but that the
                  invitation would be better if from a private
                  individual or society; hopes no English clergy will
                  come; affirms affection for England and the early
                  influence of Wilberforce.</p>

                  desire of Virginia to "cast in their lot" with their
                  Southern Brethren if it can be done without "the
                  sacrifice of principle and right;" notes that the

                  with her; asks for charity.</p>
