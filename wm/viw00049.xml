              <p>Congratulates him on being elected Attorney for
                     the counties of James City and Warwick[?]; asks if
                     he has turned Scott or Seward Whig since those
                     counties are Whig; finds it suspicious especially
                     when he [ACG] speaks of carrying the Locofocos by
                     8,000; will examine Mr. Mason's father's papers if
                     he [SG] is called an heir or a son of Adam Mason;
                     asks him to tell Bowden that the Groves land claim
                     will be reopened and a new investigation begun;

                     license to practice law; describes the town of
                     Cleburn as being "a tolerable little country town,
                     with a population of about 1200, and growing quite
                     fast"; informs him that the prairie lands in this
                     area will produce 20,000 bales of cotton, which
                     will sell for $50-$75 per bale; gives the prices
                     of flour ($6 a barrel), good cows ($6 a head),
                     horses ($25-$50), and corn ($0.25 per bushel after
                     September 1st); is currently staying at a hotel
                     but is eagerly awaiting a position in a private
                     home to teach for an hour or two a day; mentions
                     that the whole state is crowded with lawyers;
                     informs him that the land laws are complicated and
                     provide most of the revenue to be gained in this
                     profession; was obliged to ride with the driver
                     when traveling to Cleburn as the stage was filled
                     with ladies, and as a result was treated to the
                     view of a "magnificent country"; describes the
                     people as "healthy, but their eyes look dull, and
                     they are generally listless and inanimate";
                     mentions that the people are hard-working and
                     thrifty, and that Cleburn "makes no pretensions to
                     anything like fashion or refinement, but they
                     appear to be very good plain people."</p>

                     position was first offered to Mr. Wise, and when

                     [ACG] has a good chance of securing it; feels that
