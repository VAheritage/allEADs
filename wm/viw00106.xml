          <p>Takes advantage of departure of General McPherson to
               answer you and to tell you that I am infinitely touched
               by your kind remembrance. I can not console myself for
               your departure and that of your dear Parent. Madame
               Garnot has just been dangerously ill. M. Auguie was
               losing his mind from despair. You know how interesting
               Mde Garnot was both through her virtues and her talents.
               Madame Ney is still in Berne with the general. She is
               pregnant with her second child. Madame Lambert also will
               give us a little nephew in two or three months. Your old
               comrade Hortense [de Beauharnais] is with her husband .
               . . News of other female friends. Lucy Crabtree was not
               able to profit by the opportunity afforded by General
               McPherson, the expenses of travel seemed too high for
               her. Thank your dear Papa for letters which contained
               bills of exchange. Imagine how your good father must be
               full of thoughts for his two little girls who are
               here.</p>

          <p>Misfortunes of this revolution. Retired to a little
               town 15 leagues from Paris and enjoying son's society.
               Lost three thousand pounds. Battle near farm. So
               deprived of farm's rent. Nerves of stomach. Recall
               myself to you, my dear Madame Monroe and my dear scholar
               Eliza. Only sends letters of recommendation for a few
               people. Eliza has been indisposed at pains in part of
               her body after her lying ill. Wearing of flannel shifts
               and our waters in France, were the proper remedy. Must
               have some waters on new continent which bear some

          <p>I am exceedingly anxious about everything concerning

               husband. A painful gland in my breast gives me just
               fears, concerning the duration of my existence. My poor
               son was very tenderly touched by the interest you had
               taken in his sad destinies. I have seen Hortense [de
               Beauharnais] in her country house. She has recovered her
               health. She goes over her very little domain and is busy
               beautifying it. You know how much I cherished her when
               she was a Republican citizen having lost her passing
               crown.</p>

          <p>Your letter shows you are under the influence of a
               great misapprehension as to the cause and course of my
               feelings as indicated in my letters to Hortensia.
               Husband's health has been very delicate. Go to
               Washington to see Dr. Hunt. I certainly will come to my
               child, my only child and as you say, "at a moment when
               she will most require the care of her Mother." Uncertain
               of the date when she should come.</p>

          <p>Mr. Rogers looks badly. All the servants have the
               measles. Sorry to read accounts of 1 of January dinners.
               He [James Monroe] is very old and recent misfortune
               demands seclusion not solitude. If he sees company it
               should be of a different sort from Morris, Livingston,
               Ogden. Grandfather's claim has been brought forward by
               Fenton Mercer. Doesn't like Thomas Swann visiting. Tell
               me something of Maria Gouverneur. I do not wish to
               interfere in Aunt M's concerns. She has a husband to
               take care of her.</p>

               that is a slow process. Enclose a few lines from a
