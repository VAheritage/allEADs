      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection is primarily composed of letters received by
         Dr. Theodocius Joshua Scurlock (1828-1887), a graduate of
         Tulane University and a resident of Texas and Mexico,
         1855-1888, from family members in Alabama and Texas, and
         friends in Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas. The letters
         reflect the restlessness of the pre-Civil War years, and the
         difficulties and disillusionment felt by many people during
         Reconstruction. Diary included was kept by Scurlock on his
         journey to Mexico, December 1867-April 1869, in which he gives
         his impressions of the people he encountered as well as the
         natural history of the regions he passed through.</p>

        <head>Arrangement</head>
        <p>The letters in this collection are arranged into Series
            by ten year incriments, the Subseries are then arranged
            chronologically into individual years. Not every year

            arrangement. The diary is listed separately as the last

          <p>Diary of Theodocius Joshua Scurlock containing
               details of Dr. Scurlock's journey from Texas to Tulango,
               Mexico; his impressions of the lifestyles of the people
               he encountered as he traveled south and the novelties he
               sees and learns about for the first time; and a table of
               distances traveled, detailed weather reports, and
               descriptions of the locations and names of towns stayed
               in. It gives an insight to the questioning nature of Dr.
               Scurlock and his ability to describe some of the methods
               of technique he viewed (e.g., medical and spinning). It
               also contains lists of edible birds and animals, trees
               for lumber and various fruit trees and vegetables.</p>
