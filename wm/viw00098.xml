               <p>Alpha Kappa Psi was established in 1904 as a
               professional commercial fraternity, for business
               students. Its founders were students at New York
               University's evening School of Commerce, Accounts and
               Finance, which was newly created in 1900 to meet the
               double need for higher commercial education and for a
               college of accountancy. The Omega Chapter of Alpha Kappa
               Psi formed at the College of William and Mary in 1921,
               according to the records of the national
               organization.</p>
