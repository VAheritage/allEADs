<bioghist altrender="Historical Note" encodinganalog="545"><head>Historical Note</head>
  <p>The William and Mary Alumni Association was founded on July 4, 1842, and is the sixth-oldest alumni organization in the country. All graduates and former students of the College of William and Mary are considered members of the Alumni Association. The Alumni Association is an independent, nonprofit organization that serves William and Mary and its many alumni, students, parents and friends and is governed by a 17-member Board of Directors.
</p>
  <p>The generally accepted date for the founding or the William and Mary Alumni Association is July 4, 1842. An alumni organization of some sort may have been in existence before this time. However, this is the date that the Honorable Nathaniel Beverly Tucker, a judge and professor of national and municipal law and of the science of government at the College delivered the first Alumni Day oration. Further information about this individual or organization may be available in the Special Collections Research Center Wiki: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scrc.swem.wm.edu/wiki/index.php/Society of the Alumni.&quot;&gt;http://scrc.swem.wm.edu/wiki/index.php/Society of the Alumni.&lt;/a&gt;.</p>

	<head>Scope and Contents</head>
	<p>Acc. 1983.100 contains records from the Richmond Chapter of the William and Mary Alumnae Association, including correspondence, a constitution, lists of alumnae, and one notebook of meeting minutes. 
</p>
	<p>Acc. 1993. 50 contains records of the Alumni Association from the 1920s-1920s. Records from the first three executive secretaries of the association-George Willis Guy, Charles A. Taylor, and Charles P. McCurdy-include correspondence regarding recruiting members, chapters, address changes, meetings, the board, etc. The files are arranged mostly by the last name of the correspondent (for incoming mail) or recipient (for outgoing mail). Correspondence of the Alumni Association from the 1940s files of B. D. Peachy include letters regarding a new William and Mary president, the honor code, fraternity houses in trouble, agenda for meetings, and financial reports. There are also responses to a questionnaire sent in 1932 received from 1866-1932 alumni for the new alumni catalog including names, place and date of birth, occupation, other education, and some personal remarks. There are also letters from living alumni who attended between 1866 and 1881 regarding attending a memorial service for Ewell at the 1933 Alumni Day. The &quot;Necrology&quot; files hold obituaries of alumni. There is one small box of correspondence of Oscar Shewmake from the 1920s. Finally, there are nine boxes of office correspondence arranged in party by subjects, e.g. senior essay contest.
</p>
	<p>Acc. 1994.010 contains seven sheets of stationary and four envelopes with the &quot;Homecoming 1992&quot; logo; three red, white, and black plastic cups with &quot;W&amp;M Homecoming &#039;92&quot; on them; a small red, white, and black box shaped like a tuxedo with &quot;150&quot; marked in gold; and a black and red bag with the &quot;Homecoming &#039;92&quot; logo.
