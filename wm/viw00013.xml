                  as she will be married "October twelve months";

                  Mr. Shields "has completely thrown himself away";
                  urges him to visit Cousin John [?] on his way to
                  Mobile if at all convenient as Cousin John is anxious
                  to have him visit; send the love of all to him.</p>

                  being "better calculated to arouse a painful rather

                  pork; will slaughter one of her hogs today which is
                  over 500 pounds, which will give him about

            <p>Left Willamsburg twelve days before after being
                  ordered by General Wise to report to Richmond; still
                  subject to conscription as he is not yet forty years
                  old; was upset to leave his "dependent family in the
                  hands of the Yankees... and at this particular time
                  with dear Sue expected daily to be confined, and not
                  a physician in the place"; his family and Ma
                  [Henley]'s are dependent on his efforts to find
                  something to keep them all from starving as the
                  Yankees forbade the citizens from going to the mill
                  for some weeks; describes the Yankees as "stringent"
                  and "diabolical"; informs her that if the Yankees
                  relinquish the Lunatic Asylum there is a need for
                  officers there, and as he has secured a clerkship
                  there he is exempt from military service; describes
                  the shelling of Williamsburg; escaped injury from the
                  shells even though they fell quite close to his
                  house; will sell Mac for her as horses are high in
                  price; advises that her hands Edmund and John should
                  be sold as they will sell for $4,000 and the family
                  has nothing to live on now.</p>

                  have failed, in the most brutal manner, to perform
                  the only thing that comforted me with respect to your

                  Williamsburg but cannot reveal his plans as yet;
                  informs her that Molly Marshall has arrived in
                  Virginia from Mobile, fearing that the enemy will
                  take the city soon, and that Mother has gone up to
                  Greensboro where General Cocke has offered her his
                  nice place.</p>

                  restrictions and scarcity of fuel, cold and
                  starvation stares them in the face" once winter
                  arrives; hopes to rent a cottage at Ashland where he

                  a job to support himself and his family; wants to
                  move out to the farm so that he can support his
                  family off the land and devote himself to his
                  children's education; explains that Mr. Darlington
                  did not owe him $2000 as she had thought, but only
                  $700, which is almost paid off; informs her that the
                  $700 barely bought clothing and supplies of food;
                  wonders "What is to become of us all"; is staying at
                  Dr.'s with Johnny while Sue, the girls, and Little
                  Carter are at Mrs. Henley's; shares news of friends
                  and family.</p>

                  and griddle-cakes and hominy and mush, and all were

                  will be scorched by the sun; despairs for his family
                  as he is too poor to do his duty to them properly;
                  explains that he wish the $25 she sent to him had
                  been sent later as it was already spent by the time
                  the sheriff came to collect taxes on the farm; was
