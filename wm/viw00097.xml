         <p>The inventory includes letters, 1851-1861, and accounts,
         1840-1866, of Rufus King Fitzhugh and his wife Henrietta Ellen
         (Baytop) Fitzhugh of Stanardsville, Greene County, Virginia.
         Most letters to Henrietta are from her mother Lucy Taliaferro
         (Catlett) Baytop, and her sisters Rowena, Lucy Ann, and
         Eugenia, all of Springfield, Gloucester County, Virginia. Also
         includes letters from her sister-in-law Mary F. Fitzhugh of
         Fredericksburg, Virginia. These letters relate various aspects
         of nineteenth century farm life, such as men and women's
         separate responsibilities on the farm, illnesses and
         treatments, childbirth and its complications, and social
         activities. There are comments on slaves, tensions between the
         slave states and the federal government and the abolitionists,
         and the eventual Civil War. Letters to Rufus King Fitzhugh are
         generally from business associates or his brother George
         Fitzhugh, of Port Royal, Virginia. Both his letters and
         business accounts offer insight into his affairs, such as land
         speculation, mining for coal, slaves as investments, as well
         as deeds, receipts of purchase and payment of property, and
         tax receipts. An undated item records his property in Jackson
         County, Arkansas that was destroyed by the Union Army.</p>
