         <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
         <p>Mrs. Darling was born in New Hampshire in 1840, a
         descendant of Henry Adams who settled in Braintree,
         Massachusetts, in 1636. She married Col. Edward Irving
         Darling, 22 years her senior, in 1860, and went with him to
         live at his Louisiana home. He died of wounds received in
         battle, December 2, 1863. Her only son was Edward Erving
         Darling, a minor musician-composer, who died July 13, 1894.
         Mrs. Darling suffered from repeated attacks of malarial fever
         and, after 1876, from deafness. Her years of widowhood were
         spent in writing 
         <title render="italic">Mrs. Darling's Letters, or Memoirs of
         the Civil War</title>
         <title render="italic">A Social Diplomat</title>and other
         books.</p>
         <p>From 1889 to 1896 her major interests and efforts were
         devoted to the founding of women's patriotic societies. Mrs.
         Darling's obsession for organizing and ruling patriotic
         societies, and her willingness to abandon one when her opinion
         or desires were thwarted, is illustrated by the rapid
         succession with which the societies followed each other:
         Daughters of the American Revolution (D.A.R.) founded October
         11, 1890; Daughters of the Revolution (D.R.) founded June 18,
         1891; Daughters of the United States of the War of 1812,
         founded January 8, 1892; founded because of disagreement over
         policies of the D. A. R., policies adopted over the protest of
         Mrs. Darling. This collection is composed almost entirely of
         letters written to her during these years of controversy.
         There are some delightful, pithy and well-written letters in
         the group.</p>
