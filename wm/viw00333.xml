      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>Diary of a worker, probably William J. Smith, of Visalia, Tulare County, California, recording his varying types of daily work,  income and expenses, weather, health issues and social life for January through 11 November, 1937.The following description was provided by the seller: "This is a handwritten diary  printed on the cover "The Clipper Diary 1937".  Inside this diary is a Tulare County General Hospital Out-Patient Department card for William J. Smith of Visalia and a paper receipt from the Pacific Rural Press, San Francisco for Wm. J. Smith of Visalia California.  Because of a reference to being in the hospital, I think that William J. Smith is the man who kept the diary.  These  items will be included with the diary.  The diary measures 4 1/2" by 6 1/4".  It contains 318 pages.  The diary was started on Jan. 1, 1937 and continued until November 11, 1937.  The pencil entries in the diary gave a day by day account of weather, who the man worked for, what type of work he did and how many hours he worked.  It seemed that he did any kind of work for a variety of people.  He picked crops, cleaned out barns, etc.  There is also a section describing being in a hospital waiting for his surgery, telling about other patients, and information about his recovery.  He talks about visiting other people and areas.  This is a depression diary and shows how hard people had to work.  It also tells about Edie canning large quantities of food. He went to see the circus come to town, he went to see a fire that was burning in the area.  It is simply the daily life of an ordinary man and what he did each day.  What is most impressive is that he is so calm about his life and never seems to be upset if he works one hour or thirteen hours a day.  It is just what he does.  There is one page in the back that lists when he was paid and how much he received from different people that had worked for.  The diary ends on page 191.  From 192 to 318 is a printed almanac;  A pronunciation key for words commonly mispronounced; Constitution of the United States, U. S. Broadcasting stations including  Call Letters, Klocycle, Meters, Location, Power; Population of the United States; Menus; Domestic and Foreign Postal Rates, etc.  The Diary has white spots on the cover.  The inside is in good condition."</p>
