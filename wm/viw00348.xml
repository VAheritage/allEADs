      <p>"Susan was the last daughter of Issac Newton Buck and Susan Taylor and was a 6th generation descendant of Thomas Buck I, Virginia. Many of the entries are by Buck Family members and come from areas such as Mountain View, Front Royal, Willow Glen, Wheatley, etc. "</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>Poetry album of Susan Rebecca Buck, 1852-1864. The album is designed for the purpose of collecting poems or other writings and the title on the front cover reads "Album of Gems."  There are several decorative, pre-printed color images and in one instance a black and white print was glued on top of a handwritten entry.The entries were made by a number of friends and relatives and most are dated and signed either in full names, first name or by initials. Most are addressed to "Dear Sue." Place names mentioned are for the most part in Virginia and Maryland. Examples are Wheatley, Front Royal, and Mountain View.The following description was provided by the seller:"The book is titled "Album of Gems" and new, it was filled with blank pages and 6 color lithographs by T. Sinclair. Starting about 1852  Susan R. Buck had many of her friends and family members write a little poem, or words of wisdom on the blank pages, for her to remember them by. Some names, entries  and signatures are Nannie L. Buck, her devoted sister Mary, Thomas N. Buck, T.W. Buck, Sue Richardson, Bettie? Buck, Teddie, Nannie, Guillaume, Elton, and many more signed in initials, etc. Those entries continued through the years, until about 1865, which is the latest date I could find. Sue designed her own frontispiece and her introduction page reads: "Now reader, as you find delight - In scanning o'er what others write - Tis hoped, in gratitude alone, - You'll add a tribute of you own." There are at least 67 different handwritten, signed &amp; dated entries from many people. One page has a calling card design penciled in, with the names and dates (1865) of men serving in the military, probably during the Civil War. "</p>
