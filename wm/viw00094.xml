      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>James Barron Hope was born 23 March 1829 in Norfolk,
         Virginia. He was the grandson of Commodore James Barron
         (1769-1851) and son of Wilton Hope and Jane Armistead (Barron)
         Hope (1791-1862). James Barron Hope graduated from the College
         of William and Mary. He practiced law and was the
         commonwealth's attorney for Norfolk. He married Annie Beverley
         Whiting (1825-1920) in 1857. The couple had two daughters,
         Jane ("Janey" or "Jennie") Barron Hope (b. 1859?) and Ann
         ("Nanny") Hope. James Barron Hope is known primarily for his
         poetry, serving as the official poet of the 250th anniversary
         of the Jamestown settlement. He published several volumes of
         writings and also edited newspapers. Hope died in 1887.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Correspondence and literary works, chiefly 1861-1874, of
         James Barron Hope (1829-1887), soldier, author (poet, orator,
         and novelist), and newspaper editor, of Norfolk and
         Williamsburg, Virginia. The papers deal mainly with his 1849
         duel with Jonathan Pembroke Jones; his West Indies naval
         cruise (1851-1852); his Confederate military service
         (1861-1865); and the aborted 1874 William Mahone-Bradley
         Johnson duel, in which Hope was Mahone's second.</p>
      <p>The majority of correspondence with his family is with his
         wife Annie Beverley (Whiting) Hope, and his mother, Jane
         Armistead (Barron) Hope. Prominent correspondents include
         Benjamin S. Ewell, John Goode, Hugh Blair Grigsby, John
         Lesslie Hall, John Blair Hodge, General Bradley T. Johnson,
         General John B. Magruder, President John Tyler, William F.
         Vilas, and Robert C. Winthrop. The collection also contains
         numerous newspaper clippings.</p>

            <p>Don't be astonished by this correspondence; is
                  writing due to the "underground" insult [James Barron
                  Hope] made against his brother almost a year ago;
                  asks where he may be found during the next month so
                  that he may be at his "brother's right hand in this";
                  peace is desirable between men of sense, and this may
                  be the end result if [James Barron Hope] resolves it
                  correctly; hopes that James Barron Hope will properly
                  understand and answer this letter.</p>

            <p>How he treasures her letters; is he correct in
                  thinking that Baby Jane's health is slowly
                  improving?; his uncle's [Samuel Barron] position is
                  delicate, since he has not yet been ordered to hoist
                  his flag, and until then he cannot take a secretary;
                  made an offer to her brother to take Mrs. Whiting
                  [Annie's mother?] and place her in Warrenton with
                  Annie and James' mother; included Annie's father in
                  the invitation, but expects that they will go to
                  Gloucester; do not worry about her family members
                  close to the Yankees, since the recent disaster [1st
                  Bull Run, 21 July 1861] has really shaken them.</p>

            <p>John W. Goode recently sent him a copy of the
                  Conservative Review of March, 1900, which contained
                  articles by both Goode and her [Janey Barron Hope]; a
                  short time later he read a review of her article in
                  the Norfolk Landmark, which expressed his opinion in
                  much better terms than he himself could write; he
                  [Janey's Uncle] and her aunt are both in good health;
                  love to her mother, her husband and the children.</p>
