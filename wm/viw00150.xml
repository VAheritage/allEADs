He served in the Hospital Corp Service of the Navy until August 28, 1919 when he began his studies to be an Episcopal priest. On September 18, 1919, he entered St. Stephen's College, Annandale-on-Hudson and graduated in spring 1922.  Between September 26, 1922 and spring 1925, he studied at the General Theological Seminary in New York City as a candidate for the ministry and as a postulant of Bishop Burleson, spending the summers in the Mission field of South Dakota.

</p>
              <p>When Group 1 was accessioned, the seller had removed, and filed separately, letters that were written by well known people, such as Harry F. Byrd, a Virginia Senator and President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  These letters were returned to the file in A-Z order, but they are noted in the list of correspondents.  Most correspondents' names are noted, but some are either too difficult to read or do not appear on the letter.  The content and date of some letters have been noted.  Also, some letters have a note by Rev. Samuel H. Sayre along the top margin where he gives an explanation about the letter or letter writer.  These notes appear to have been added at a later date rather than at the time of receipt.  Possibly, Rev. Sayre went through his professional correspondence and kept items that reflect the variety of his ministry.
</p>
              <p>Even though there are a few family letters, most of the correspondence concerns Rev. Samuel H. Sayre's ministry, his church related activities, his professional activities or other personal concerns not related to his family.</p>

              <p>These papers appear to be notes, outlines and full copies of sermons given by other ministers.   Some of them could possibly be sermons given by Samuel H. Sayre.  Some of the papers have a topic written along the top margin and note hymns sung.  It is difficult to tell if the original order was by these topics, by date order, or another order, but they have been placed in date order.
</p>
              <p>Because of the fragile condition of the paper on which these notes are handwritten, some of them have been photocopied.  The originals are filed with the photocopies.
</p>
              <p>Some of the names on the papers who are noted as deliverers of a sermon include Rev. Belliss, Rev. Bonacker, Rev. Holmes, Rev. Walker, Rev. White and others.  Rev. F.C. Benson Belliss, Rev. Ralph Bonacker and Rev. Pierce Butler were the clergy for St. Paul's Church in Chicago, Illinois in the Summer of 1938.</p>

            <p>The 1918 to 1963 diaries tell mainly of Rev. Sayre's day to day activities and usually include letters he has written and received, where he gone, when he naps, and people he meets if they include family and close friends.  He often notes where he eats his meals, what time he rises, and what he is reading.  After his marriage in 1938, his entries become a little fuller.  When he is visiting his family, he goes into a little more detail, but still sticks to the facts.  His train and automobile trips across country are usually interesting.  Very rarely does he share his feelings, though he might comment if a letter was wonderful, a meal great, a death hard on a family or how great it is to be back at college or at his old home or with Marjorie after a separation.  There are addresses, notes, accounts, Christmas lists and book lists in the back of many of the early diaries.  In most of the diaries, he will note in the top margin if he changes locations, particularly for an overnight stay or a trip and when he moves.  Years 1953 to October 1, 1959 are missing.</p>

            <p>Beginning in 1938, Rev. Sayre uses a journal instead of a one year diary.
</p>
            <p>In front of the diary are news clippings, notes, articles, letters and flyers.  One flyer is for Altar Wines from James Moroney of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and one clipping announces his resignation from St. Mary's Episcopal Church on October 1 to become rector of St. John's Church, Bellefonte and gives a brief biography of his ministry up to that point.
</p>
            <p>He begins the new larger diary ""Â¦giving a fuller and more detailed account of my daily activities"Â¦of my personal impressions of people, places and things and events, too"Â¦"
</p>
            <p>Rev. Sayre then summarizes his other diaries, beginning with 1917. He divides the earlier diaries into "Babyhood", "Boyhood", "Youth" and "Young Manhood" periods.
</p>
            <p>He gives more detail of events that he recorded in these early diaries, such as a conflict with Dr. George Thomas of St. Paul's Church in Kenwood, Chicago and the effects of the Depression on St. Mary's Church in Pennsylvania.  On Page 10, he gives a wonderful description of Marjorie Renison Sayre, his wife.
</p>
            <p>The 1938 diary begins his "Manhood" period.
</p>
            <p>His early entries are more in depth and personal, even giving detail of things that happened in the past, or people, such as his Mother, but he quickly reverts to just telling of his daily activities with few personal touches.
</p>
            <p>Rev. Sayre mentions listening to the new presiding Bishop, Rt. Rev. Henry St. George Tucker of Virginia, on the radio on New Year's Day, 1938.
</p>
            <p>He writes "Rev. Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin of Williamsburg, Virginia" on January 10, 1938 and spends the day with him on April 27, 1938.
</p>
            <p>Gives resignation to St. Mary's Church and The Church of Our Saviour and meets with Vestry of both churches on July 21, 1938.  On September 29, 1938, Marjorie and Samuel Sayre move to Bellefonte, Pennsylvania where he is the new Priest of St. John's Episcopal Church.
</p>
            <p>June 8, 1939 Rev. Sayre receives official call to become rector of St. Barnabas Church, Eagle Rock, California where he would succeed his father-in-law, Rev. George E. Renison.  On June 13th, he talks to his Mother about it.  He hands in his resignation at the St. John's Vestry meeting on July 31, 1939.  His last service was on Sunday, October 1 and he began October 15th at St. Barnabas.  Grandmother Renison is to live with them in the Parish House per October 23rd entry.
</p>
            <p>On August 18, 1939, Rev. Sayre and his family, while he is visiting Newport News, learn that his brother, Dan, who has been in the State Institution in Pennhurst near Spring City, Pennsylvania due to a brain injury at birth, is ill.  He dies on August 19, 1939.
</p>
            <p>Talks about his parents on January 20, 1937.</p>

Renison, died on January 17, 1951.</p>
