               influenza rampant; tells of a party given by Mr. and
               Mrs. Mason, describing the handsome men, the dancing,
               and the fact that even Mrs. Anderson, Mrs. Paradice
               [sic], and her mother were there; "war" is still the
               main topic of discussion, with revenge at the
               "epidemical" stage, even affecting the ladies; mentions
               E. Coleman and his politicing.</p>

               their studies, which she is disappointed by, because
               before the dancing began, the men discussed various
               political subjects, some speaking quite eloquently; Mr.

               <p>Cannot imagine why Mr. Callaway could have led her
               [JCC] to believe that she [SCW] was to marry Mr. Irvine;
               there are almost 70 eligible men in town, "which is a
               large number considering the Embargo"; Mr. Anderson is
               pleased to be in Lynchburg; mention of Mrs. Camp and
               Maria Moody; the students have formed a military
               company, and parade every Saturday in beautiful scarlet
               coats and "black velvet gaters," including her [SCW]
               handsome beau [Mr. Irvine?]; also heard that he is
               superior to anyone on the Junior Class, and hopes that
               she will pass the information on to his sister; has
               heard that Eliza [(Wright) Mayo] and her husband are
               doing poorly financially, neither of them being

               <p>Mention of the harsh winter; there have been many
               parties, several of which were given by Mrs. Mason; did
               not attend any of the dancing parties, but did go to
               many card parties, because they are not as crowded, but
               are more fun; mention also of a party given by Mr.
               Radford; tells of a visit by Sally Browne, who has grown
               up quite a bit; Maria Savage is still there; teases
               about Eliza [(Wright)] Mayo becoming a matron and
               dressing "in the antique style"; tells of duel fought
               between Mr. Jones and Mr. Cabell, two students [at the
               College], and that both have been expelled; Mr. Jones
               received a wound to his thigh, which will more than
               likely render him a cripple; asks if she has seen Mrs.
               Ann E. Callaway, and comments that "perhaps matrimony
               has made as great a change in her sentiments as in Eliza
               Mayo's"; expects a dull Spring, as the Bishop [James
               Madison] has prohibited parties; regards to and from
               Mrs. Camp, S. Jackson, Mrs. Anderson, and the
