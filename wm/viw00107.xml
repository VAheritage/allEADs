         <lb/>Anatole Kalichevsky (March 28, 1870-April 3, 1937) was a
         career military officer in the White Army of Russia where he

         of the last of the Czars. He was exiled from Russia in 1921
         and arrived in America that year via Yokohama. When he lived
         in New York he was active in Russian army veterans
         associations. He had one son Vladimir. Anatole was born in

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This small collection, 1871-1955, primarily in Russian,
         documents the military career of Russian Major General Anatole
         Kalichevsky (1870-1937) and the travel diaries of his son,
         Vladimir Kalichevsky (1895- 1958), a petroleum engineer who
         spent most of his career in Texas and northern New Jersey.
         Examples of items relating to Anatole are his service record,
         military orders, his diplomatic passport, and his 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New York Times</title>obituary.
         Vladimir, a graduate of the California Institute of
         Technology, wrote several books on petroleum engineering,
         three of which are in the collection. The diaries cover the
         years 1902-1955 and refer to tourist attractions throughout
         the United States and Europe as well as academic lectures
         attended while traveling. Also included are family photographs
         and Russian orders and badges awarded to Anatole. All
         documents are in Russian unless otherwise indicated.</p>
