      <p>This collection is comprised of more than 700 letters written by Herman Recht (1908-1971), a Navy yeoman, from Camp Peary (U. S. Naval Construction Training Center), near Williamsburg, Virginia, between October, 1943 to February 1946 to his wife, Esther, in Clairton, Pennsylvania. There are no letters from Esther because, as he wrote to her, saving them would make him homesick.
</p>
      <p>Recht had been a lawyer for eight and a half years before joining the Navy. He was very well read, and regularly came into Williamsburg to dine at the Williamsburg Lodge and borrow books from and read magazines in the William and Mary library where his interests ran from public affairs to the latest fiction. He often inquires about activities in the Jewish community in Clairton, and is a strong advocate for racial minorities. He is very knowledgeable about classical music. He regularly reads the Pittsburgh Press and inquires about friends and family in Clairton and Pittsburgh.  Gossip about friends from home is included in almost every letter.</p>

              <p>He is the only Jew in the barracksâother men are about age 28-38, mostly technicians. Sailors on 12-hour leave go to Williamsburg since they may not make it back from Richmond on time.  Refers to Seabees in Casablanca, Sicily, and Salerno.  He will be promoted from Apprentice Seamen (A.S.) to 2d Class Seaman and maybe to 1st Class Seamen at the end of boot camp. Volunteers for yeoman duty when call made for typistsâplays chessâmen 35 and older exempted from the obstacle courseâregularly visits a rabbi. Tells Esther that he doesnât save her letters because he doesnât want to make himself homesick.</p>

              <p>On yeoman duty for 8 Â½ hours but didnât have more than 15 minutes work. Isnât allowed to use typewriter to write personal letters during work hours. Laundry must be hung properlyâwhites on the whites line and blues and other colored items on the blues line; explosion in Yorktown on the 16th. Men chop wood for fuel. Most men have more to offer the war effort than his âless brawny and less combat or-construction skilled brains have to give.â Jobs are frequently shifted; lawyers doing mosquito control, insurance work, and lecturing. Would like time to read and listen to music; reads  Lâil Abner comic strip. Peary is  the only boot camp for Seabees in the country. Some Chief Petty Officers arenât too bright. HR is reading âThe Psychology of the Fighting Man.â Unlike sailors, soldiers can send clothes to a laundry. His promotion to S2C is a âbig event.â</p>

              <p>Had to shave by razor since electricity is frequently cut off during the dayâall 58 pieces of clothing are expected to fit in a white sea bag. Accepted for yeoman training---was sort of interested in storekeeperâs school. He thinks his letters sound dull and asks Estherâs view.  An 18 year-old  Vermonter with a harsh and shrill voice is uncomfortable with the swearing that goes on. He is âgetting apt in the use of âfuckinââ this and âfuckinââ that with all the various nuances.â
</p>
              <p>Religious Emphasis Week; heard several talks by Rabbi Philip S. Bernstein, of Rochester, NY relating to Jews in Palestine and Central Europe. A friend at home writes that the new assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic, âthat young Bernsteinâ is a friend of hers.   Convinced of the evils of organized religion and of the âtommyrot of much of the ritual.â  No cameras allowedâdoubts that he could be admitted to officer training due to his defective eyes. A fellow sailor dislikes the Southerners for their prejudices but âthey donât mind sleeping with black gals.â A record 2,150 inductees in one day.</p>

Got a recommendation letter for his transfer to the library or transportation job from H. Passamaneck, Director of the Young Menâs and Womenâs Hebrew Association. Finally gets transferred into the Transportation office.  He finished âThey Shall Not Sleepâ by Leland Stowe, which talks about the future relations between the US and Russia; there is talk about making the camp into regular navy.  Has gotten his leave approved, and saw the movie âLady in the Dark;â supposedly will be getting 3,000 people who canât read or speak English in camp later this week.  Talks about how the postwar period will be something to observe and live through, for many latent prejudices will come out then.  Talks about Jewish services at the Camp, and how they are uninspiring; watched the movie âPurple Heartâ; bringing more regular navy to the base. Has been put on special assignment, meaning he does not meet the Navyâs physical standards, as the Navy is now integrating SA men into the entire Navy, not just putting them into the Seabees.</p>
