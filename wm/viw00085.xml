         <p>The central figures in this collection are Cuthbert Powell
         (1775-1849), his son, Charles Leven Powell (1804-1896),
         Charles Leven Powell's wife, Selina (Lloyd) Powell (d. 1871),
         and their children.</p>
         <p>
         <emph render="bold">Cuthbert Powell</emph>
         <lb />Cuthbert Powell (1775-1849) was born in Middleburg,
         Loudoun County, Virginia to parents Leven Powell (1737-1810)
         and Sarah (Harrison) Powell. He was one of eleven children.
         Cuthbert made his fortune alongside his brother, Leven Powell,
         Jr. (1772-1807), as a merchant and ship owner. He retired to
         "Llangollen," Loudoun County, Virginia in 1812 after a decline
         in business. Later he was elected to serve in both houses of
         the Virginia General Assembly; the Virginia State Senate in
         1829 and the Virginia House of Delegates in 1840. In 1788,
         Cuthbert married Catherine Simms, daughter of Col. Charles
         Simms. The couple had ten children including; Anne Maria
         Powell (1800-1885), who married 1st cousin Dr. William Levin
         Powell; Dr. Llewellen Powell (1802-1870), who married cousin
         Sarah Elizabeth Harrison; Charles Leven Powell (1804-1896),
         who married Selina Lloyd; Mary Emily Powell (b.1807), who
         married cousin Cuthbert Powell and later Rev. George Adie;
         Ellen Douglas Powell (1813- 1862) who married Judge William H.
         Gray; Cuthbert Harrison Powell (1814-1897); and Jane Simms
         (Fanny) Powell, who married Wellington Gordon.</p>
         <p>
         <emph render="bold">Charles Leven Powell and Family</emph>
         <lb />Charles Leven Powell (1804-1896) married Selina Lloyd
         (d. 1871) in 1830. The couple had six children, including;
         Rebecca Powell (1831-1921), Harriet Lee "Hattie" (Powell)
         Smoot (1833-1870), Lloyd Powell (1834-1861), Charles Leven
         Powell, Jr. (1835-1862), Minna Powell (1837-1854), and Selina
         "Nina" (Powell) Hepburn (1842-1918). Harriet Lee "Hattie"
         (Powell) Smoot (1833-1870) married Rector Smoot. In 1871,
         Selina "Nina" (Powell) Hepburn (1842-1918) married Sewell
         Stavely Hepbron. At some point, the last name Hepbron was
         changed to Hepburn.</p>
         <p>Charles Leven Powell (1804-1896) graduated from Yale
         College in 1825. After unsuccessful attempts at starting a law
         practice in Alexandria, Virginia, he was able to support his
         family as a teacher. Still hoping to advance his law career,
         the family moved to Henry, Illinois in 1850. After the death
         of their daughter, Minna Powell (1837-1854), the family
         returned to Virginia leaving the two sons behind. The parents
         opened a girls boarding school in Winschester, Virginia, but
         at the start of the Civil War in 1861 were forced to shut
         down. Lloyd Powell (1834-1861) returned to Virginia to enlist
         in the war and was killed at the 1st Battle of Bull Run, 21
         July 1861. Following his death, Charles Leven Powell, Jr.
         (1835-1862) returned to Virginia to enlist and was killed in a
         skirmish in August 1862. The rest of the family scattered
         across the state to live with various relatives until the end
         of the war. The family reassembled in Alexandria, Virginia and
         opened another school for girls called the "Arlington
         Institute." The teachers on staff include Charles Leven Powell
         (1804-1896), his wife and his three remaining daughters. This
         school supported the family for 30 years until its closure in
         1894.</p>

                        <p>Says Mr. Philip Cabell is stopping by
                        "Bremo" on his way to Richmond, so she is
                        taking this opportunity to send a letter;
                        discusses opportunities for her to work with
                        other families and how she should set this up;
                        wishes she could come to see them but says it
                        is impossible because the canal is "broken up,"
                        the roads are bad, and the Yankees destroyed
                        the carriage; hopes that she is comfortable at
                        Gen[eral] Cocke's; hopes that he doesn't mind
                        her being there since he is a wealthy man.
                        Letter is continued on a small slip of paper -
                        advises on the different uses of "shall" and
                        "will" in writing letters.</p>
