      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Maximilian Hartman was born circa 1837 in Bavaria, Germany.  In Germany, he worked as a tailor.  After emigrating to the United States, he resided in Reading, Pennsylvania.  In 1861, Maximilian and his brother John enlisted in the Union Zouaves, a regiment which consisted of a high number of men of German and German-American origin.  At the time of enlistment, he was married and with at least one child.  In November, 1861, Hartman’s 93rd Regiment left Pennsylvania to take up position to guard the defenses of Washington.  His diaries cover the entire time of his service, from Pennsylvania to Washington and ultimately Virginia.  In May, 1862 Hartman took part in the Battle of Williamsburg; his regiment suffered few losses.  At the end of May, Hartman’s left hand was seriously wounded at the Battle of Fair Oaks.  He was captured, exchanged and sent to New York where his wounds were treated.  Discharged in November of 1862, Hartman never regained the use of his hand.
