<bioghist altrender="Biographical Note" encodinganalog="545"><head>Biographical Note</head>
  <p>Maximilian Hartman was born circa 1837 in Bavaria, Germany.&nbsp; In Germany, he worked as a tailor.&nbsp; After emigrating to the United States, he resided in Reading, Pennsylvania.&nbsp; In 1861, Maximilian and his brother John enlisted in the Union Zouaves, a regiment which consisted of a high number of men of German and German-American origin.&nbsp; At the time of enlistment, he was married and with at least one child.&nbsp; In November, 1861, Hartman’s 93rd Regiment left Pennsylvania to take up position to guard the defenses of Washington.&nbsp; His diaries cover the entire time of his service, from Pennsylvania to Washington and ultimately Virginia.&nbsp; In May, 1862 Hartman took part in the Battle of Williamsburg; his regiment suffered few losses.&nbsp; At the end of May, Hartman’s left hand was seriously wounded at the Battle of Fair Oaks.&nbsp; He was captured, exchanged and sent to New York where his wounds were treated.&nbsp; Discharged in November of 1862, Hartman never regained the use of his hand.
