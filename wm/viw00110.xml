<head>Introduction
</head>
<p>The scope of a comprehensive bibliography on Jamestown must necessarily be broad, spanning the whole range of the site's history from 1607 to 2007, from English exploration and colonization to the era of American hegemony and nostalgia, from the matchlock to ground-penetrating radar, from iron-helmeted mercenaries seeking gold and glory for King and Church to the denim-clad troops of Historical Archaeology and High Academe digging carefully into earth and archive for nuggets of the past, from the enigmatic daughter of a tribal leader to a larger-than-life heroine of Hollywood hype, from the early proselytizers of adventure and fortune to historians describing in turn the mythical and the factual, from the coffee klatch of gentlewomen hoping to preserve their visions of ancestral valor to the planners and promoters of past and future celebrations of Jamestown's "firsts."</p>
<p>
The variety of formats represented among the entries of such a bibliography must also be extensive, covering the range of technologies used to record data and dreams throughout the period. There are manuscripts and archives; books and pamphlets; periodical articles, research reports, and lectures; songs, poems, plays, and novels; maps, charts, paintings, sound recordings, and films; and, yes, even computer programs.</p>
<p>
This document has all of the above and more, but it does not have everything. From the beginning it has been understood that the bibliography would be not only a lengthy listing of resources, but also an exercise in compiling such a tool using computer software, thereby creating a database which could easily be supplemented in the future. The resources dedicated to the bibliography were never sufficient to generate an exhaustive compilation covering the four centuries of Jamestown's recorded history. The database, however, can be augmented as new materials are produced and as earlier documents are discovered and cataloged.</p>
<p>
The bibliography has been created under a Cooperative Agreement between the National Park
Service and the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. The entire project is known as the Jamestown Archaeological Assessment. Its goal has been to undertake archaeological, historical, and bibliographic studies that can be used by the Park Service in evaluating and managing the cultural resources on Jamestown Island.</p>
<p>
Much of the bibliographic work of the assessment project was undertaken by the project's historian, who visited depositories and record offices, scanned newspapers and periodicals, identified relevant maps and other charts, and created databases citing references to Jamestown in all of these sources. The databases are invaluable resources which, as of the publication of this report, exist outside the formal bibliography.</p>
<p>
The bibliography itself was generated principally by two methods-searching online bibliographic databases and perusing published works and their reference lists. Initially, a large number of foreign and domestic depositories were queried in search of documents that might contain clues to Jamestown's past. This strategy, however, rarely produced sufficient information to comprise an entry in the bibliography, though it did provide the project historian with a few intriguing leads. (Most depositories do not have finding aids at a level of detail that would allow a busy staff person to locate relevant citations without extensive research. Such a task would require on-site visits by experienced historians possessing adequate language and research skills. The responses to our polling of the depositories indicate that this is an area of inquiry that is worthy of pursuit. Archives in Spain and the Netherlands seem to offer especially good prospects for useful results.)</p>
<p>
The online databases searched were the OCLC Online Computer Library Center, the RLIN Bibliographic Files of Research Libraries Group, and the DIALOG service of Knight-Ridder Information, Inc. Records relating to Jamestown, Virginia, were downloaded from these databases and transferred by way of Biblio-Link into ProCite databases. Biblio-Link and ProCite are computer programs published by Research Information Systems. ProCite is the bibliographic management software that was designated by the National Park Service for use in creating the assessment project's bibliography.</p>
<p>
Depositories known to be holding the original or a copy of the map are noted in each entry. Most maps are available at the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. The bibliographer examined the maps at the Rockefeller Library and used the title and imprint information as it appears on each chart, with some punctuation changes to enhance logic and clarity.</p>
<p>
Entries on audiovisual materials in sections 14 through 18 often include information on accompanying literature, such as a teacher's guide. Pictorial Works, in Section 19, include paintings, posters, prints, and stereographs.</p>
<p>
Section 21 has entries describing conference papers, periodical articles, and project reports generated by assessment project staff during the five years of the Cooperative Agreement.</p>
<p>
References in the indexes are to entry numbers, not page numbers. Numerous index listings have been added in order to cite authors and titles which are noted in the bibliography but which do not have separate entries of their own.</p>
<p>
After the principal bibliography was compiled, The National Park Service reviewed and noted about thirty additional entries that they would like to have included. Rather than reformat the text and indexes, these were added to the end of the ProCite database and then individually inserted in the printed document. For this reason, occasionally entry numbers may appear "out of order" (for example, 1217 may be between 470 and 471). To facilitate ease of use, in this case both the entry number and page number are included in the index (e.g., 1217 (PAGE 172)).</p>
<p>
The Author Index includes individual authors, corporate authors, illustrators, editors, compilers, cartographers, surveyors, engravers, composers, producers, directors, and any other contributors that might be noted in entries.</p>
<p>
The subject headings used in the Subject Index, and also in the Keywords fields of the ProCite database, are based on Library of Congress Subject Headings, 18th ed. (Washington: 1995), with some adaptations. Since this bibliography is about a particular place, most geographic subdivisions would be redundant. The main heading "Jamestown (Va.)" is used, however, with such general subdivisions as "Description and travel" and "History" and with form subdivisions such as "Guidebooks," "Juvenile literature," and "Pictorial works."</p>
<p>
Listings in the Index to Place Names on Maps appear as they are spelled on the maps. References to Jamestown, for example, might be found under lames T., Iamestown, James To., James Town, and several other forms. The index includes sites on or near Jamestown Island. References to Williamsburg (established in 1699) are given only for eighteenth-century maps.</p>
<p>
The ProCite database of bibliographic records has additional information that does not appear in this printed bibliography. A few items have not been included if they could not be examined directly and if their records are too incomplete to be useful. Some records in the ProCite database contain references to book reviews or to microform versions of the work. If the form of the author's name on a work differs from uniform entry, the variant is cited in a note. For obscure items entered from OCLC records, the name of the cataloging library is given as a suggestion of availability. The ProCite database will be in the possession of the National Park Service at the end of the assessment project. Its subsequent availability is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>
The Jamestown Archaeological Assessment's first bibliographer was Susan Shames, Decorative Arts Librarian at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. In the early months of the project, she developed a plan for the bibliography, installed ProCite and entered the first records, sent query letters to more than 130 foreign and domestic archives, and generously bestowed upon her successor the benefits of her hard work and knowledge.</p>
<p>
Among those at the outset who provided counsel and suggested a course of action were John Haskell (Swem Library, College of William and Mary), Karen Ordahl Kupperman (University of Connecticut), Helen Wallis (Map Division, British Library), David and Alison Quinn (Liverpool), David Ransome (Rhode Island School of Design), Lorena Walsh (Colonial Williamsburg Foundation), and Martha McCartney. As the project's historian, however, Ms. McCartney has been a valued colleague for the duration. She identified most of the maps listed in Section 13, and her tireless sleuthing has produced files of data from countless sources detailing the story of Jamestown.</p>
<p>
The central role of computers in the assembling of this bibliography produced a heavy reliance on technical support. Beth Nagle (Information Technology, Colonial Williamsburg Foundation) gave sound advice on hardware and later installed software for the project. Bettina Manzo (Swem Library, College of William and Mary), Chuck Ralkind (National Park Service-Yorktown), and librarians Effie Nicosia, Don Dowdey and Garland Gouger (NASA-Langley) shared their experiences as ProCite users. Much helpful assistance was sought and obtained from customer service personnel at Personal Bibliographic Software, SOLINET, OCLC, RLIN, and Research Information Systems, most notably Karen Jordan (PBS) and Diane Brown (SOLINET).</p>
<p>
Seventy-five percent of the depositories that were queried at the beginning of the project graciously responded. As leads developed or questions arose regarding a specific collection or document, other inquiries were dispatched. Helpful responses came from W. J. Hitchens at the University of Sheffield; Donald Gibson at the Kent County (England) Archives; Mary Sampson at the Royal Society in London; Mrs. P. Thomson at the William Salt Library, Stafford, England; R. M. Haubourdin at the Algemeen Rijksarchief in The Hague; Pilar Lazaro de la Escosura at the Archivo General de Indias in Seville; William R. Erwin, Jr., at Duke University; Eva M. Chandler, Margaret D. Hrabe, and Robin D. Wear at the University of Virginia's Alderman Library; E. Lee Shepard at the Virginia Historical Society; Mary Dessypris and John Kneebone at the Library of Virginia; Gretchen Schneider and Ann Berry at the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities; Margaret Cook at Swem Library, College of William and Mary; Eric G. Ackermann at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University; and staff at Macalaster College's DeWitt Wallace Library and at the Montgomery County (Ohio) Records Center and Archives.</p>
<p>
Assessment project team members submitted copies of reports, articles, and conference papers for inclusion in the bibliography. Cary Carson, senior principal investigator, 	provided guidance within an atmosphere conducive to independent work. Greg Brown has been very helpful with the preparation of the final report. Administrative and clerical support was ably supplied by Wendy Sumerlin and Lynn Fletcher. National Park Service staff, including Jane Sundberg, Jim Haskett, David Riggs, and Diane Stallings, gave advice, information, and encouragement.</p>
<p>
The John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library and its predecessor, the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation Library, have provided "headquarters" for the bibliography project, as well as the bibliographer's other job. The cooperation and support of the library staff have been crucial to the accomplishment of this work. Numerous interlibrary loans were arranged by Lois Danuser. Suggestions from Mary Haskell and Julie Conlee helped facilitate access to online services. John Ingram, Gail Greve, and George Yetter in the Special Collections Department gathered maps, acquired microfilm, and located obscure uncataloged items in the vault. A willing assist and a smile were always available from Inge Flester.</p>
<p>
The bibliographer's participation in this project would have been impossible without the encouragement and support of Susan Berg and Liz Ackert, Director and Public Services Librarian respectively at the Rockefeller Library. Among their many contributions were a boost at the start, clarification of goals, ongoing advice, work space, flexible scheduling, technical support, and practical solutions to unforeseen problems.</p>

<head>Foreword
</head>
<p>The ten-volume Jamestown Archaeological Assessment (JAA) represents the culmination of six decades of archaeology conducted by the National Park Service on one of the most significant sites in North America. In the 1930s, J. C. Harrington, the father of historical archaeology, conducted the first surveys of New Towne that identified the foundations of major buildings from the seventeenth-century capital city. In the 1950s, John L. Cotter developed a grid system for New Towne that resulted in the development of a historical base map, which proved to be invaluable for the JAA team. Then in the late 1980s, James N. Haskett, Assistant Superintendent, identified the need to survey the entire portion of Jamestown Island owned by the National Park Service. The objectives of this survey were to test new methods of locating archaeological sites, evaluate their effectiveness, and ensure a comprehensive and integrated approach. The Assessment included the relationship of the natural environment to the historical events, historical documentation of land ownership and those who lived on Jamestown Island, an analysis of artifacts and skeletal material previously uncovered, and using the latest technology, i.e., Geographical Information Systems, to document the discoveries. As we approach the 400th anniversary of Jamestown in 2007, this assessment will serve as a guiding light for the preservation and interpretation of America's birthplace well into the next century.</p>
<p>
I wish to thank for their dedicated service and enthusiasm: James Haskett, Dr. David G. Orr, Jane Sundberg, David Riggs, Diane Stallings, Chuck Rafkind, Karen G. Rehm, and other members of the park staff. The research teams of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, as directed by Dr. Cary Carson and Dr. Marley Brown, III, and The College of William and Mary, under the direction of Dennis Blanton, who prepared the studies, are to be commended for their scholarly and thorough approach. Last but not least, I acknowledge the support of Kate Stevenson, Associate Director, Cultural Resource Stewardship and Partnerships, National Park Service, and the Jamestown Rediscovery project team under the direction of Dr. William Kelso of the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities in their roles as partners in preserving and studying Jamestown. The printing of this study is funded in part by the Valley Forge Center for Cultural Resources.</p>

There are several letters from Bacon to Berkeley and several from Berkeley to Bacon. They show that Berkeley went to England during the Civil War to fight for the King, that Bacon was related to Lady Berkeley, that Lady Berkeley was in England during most of the rebellion, and that she corresponded with Philip Ludwell.
The Bath Papers add to the already abundant evidence that Bacon fought partly to end misgovernment in Virginia. The evidence comes not only from Bacon's supporters but from Berkeley himself, Ludwell, and others." "Berkeley's letters explain why he did not hang Bacon when he had him in his power, why he dissolved the Long Assembly and called for a new election based on a widened franchise, why he evacuated the almost impregnable post of Jamestown. There are several revealing letters by Philip Ludwell." </p>

<p>Despite close to a century's worth of archaeological investigations at Jamestown, little is known about the actual layout of the town, or the manner in which it was developed. Jamestown's legendary failure has served only to emphasize the unique nature of the tobacco plantation economy and its incompatibility with English settlement patterns, while the site's archaeological remains have served as static relics of America's quintessential frontier town. Yet the archaeological traces of Jamestown provide evidence of a far more complex past. Virginia elites, while promoting the tobacco economy, strove also to develop Jamestown, holding culturally influenced expectations of the wealth to be had from speculative development, emulating the architecture, regulations, and layout employed in English and Irish towns, and experimenting with industries which were proving successful in new towns within England. While the century witnessed vast economic, technological, social, political, and religious changes taking place in England, Virginia's leaders and settlers kept pace with these trends. In spite of environmental constraints, the demands of the regional tobacco economy and the emerging world system, as well as the presence of alternative Native American and African cultural models, Virginia's seventeenth-century leaders continued to model their development efforts after those employed in Britain. To understand Jamestown's archaeological expressions, and in particular the presence of abandoned industries, rowhouses, and the abundant use of brick, it is imperative to consider the broader cultural context within which the site's planners, speculators, and occupants were operating and interactingBibliography: 336-70. </p>

<p>Selected Roanoke and Jamestown writings dominate this study of the form of early Southern writing, which proposes that form has ideological implication. Jamestown texts suggest that duplicating the English social structure will fail because that structure cannot adapt to the complexities of American experience. Overall, the texts show a tendency to comedy at times of severe cultural stress. </p>

<p>During the first decades after the Revolution, the original settlements at Jamestown and Plymouth came to be appreciated by American authors as cornerstones of the nation, foundations of American institutions and ideals. Indeed, most of the literature written before the Civil War about Jamestown and Plymouth seeks to advance the myth that the nation began with the heroics of John Smith and the Pilgrims. By the mid-nineteenth century, the patriotic spirit of the literature was often tempered by the realization that the ideals and achievements of the colonial past could not be easily assimilated with the values and objectives of the American present. As the Civil War drew nearer, American writers became preoccupied with the tragic aspects of Jamestown and Plymouth, generating a surprisingly strong impression of a nation disturbed by, as it was proud of, its colonial beginningsBibliography: 497-519. </p>

<p>1) T. M. [Thomas Mathew], "The Beginning, Progress and Conclusion of Bacons Rebellion in Virginia in the Years 1675 and 1676," 1705, Library of Congress. Mathew, a merchant-planter in Northumberland County, represented Stafford County in the 1676 session of the House of Burgesses and was an eyewitness to many events he described. His narrative has been printed in several sources (see Andrews, p. 14). 2) ["The History of Bacon's and Ingram's Rebellion," 1676], Virginia Historical Society. The unknown author evidently was a Virginian who was familiar with the course of the rebellion and obtained some of his evidence as an eyewitness. Some leaves of the document are missing from the beginning and the end. Two versions have been printed in Massachusetts Historical Society publications (see Andrews, pp. 45-46). </p>
<p>3) "A True Narrative of the Rise, Progresse, and Cessation of the Late Rebellion in Virginia, Most Humbly and Impartially Reported by His Majestyes Commissioners Appointed to Enquire into the Affaires of the Said Colony," 1677, two copies: Public Record Office (C.O. 5/1371) and Pepysian Library, Magdalene College, Cambridge. The report was signed by commissioners John Berry and Francis Moryson. The volumes in which the copies are to be found at the PRO and at Cambridge also contain copies of many letters and papers written or received by the commissioners.Reprint: Bowie, Md., Heritage Books, 1992.</p>

<p>The first history of the colony by a native Virginian. The four sections deal with the first settlement of Virginia, natural resources and commerce, the Indians, and the present state of the colony. Louis B. Wright, in his introduction to a 1947 reprint (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press), describes Beverley's account of the early period as sketchy and inaccurate and the weakest portion of the work. His treatment of the Indians, however, is sympathetic and realistic. In a revised edition published in 1722, Beverley softened his comments on personalities and made an effort to restrain his satirical tone. </p>

<p>The report includes all recorded exploration at Jamestown up to 1958. It documents the archeological work at Jamestown, provides basic field data on the architecture, artifacts and community structure, and summarizes these data so as to indicate the way of life which was developing in Virginia during the seventeenth century. Excavations revealed aboriginal remains, a Confederate fort, several churches, two cemeteries and a large number of dwellings and outbuildings. A summary discusses life at Jamestown and how it changed under the conditions of the New World. There are appendices on ceramics, other artifacts, and floral and faunal remains.

<p>The first history of the early years of the colony based on extensive documentation. Stith, a minister and future President of the College of William and Mary, relied mainly on John Smith's writings and the copies of Virginia Company records then in the possession of William Byrd. The emphasis, therefore, is on the years 1607 to 1609 and 1619 to 1624, when the narrative ends. Stith champions John Smith and supports the Sandys-Farrar faction of the Virginia Company against the villainous Sir Thomas Smith and James IThe appendix is separately paged and has its own title page: "An Appendix to the First Part of the History of Virginia, Containing a Collection of Such Ancient Charters or Letters Patent, As Relate to That Period of Time..." Included are the three charters of the Virginia Company and the Company's July 1621 "Ordinance and Constitution...for a Council of State and General Assembly."Reprint, with a new introduction by Darrett B.

<p>Anglo-Powhatan relations began with expectations on the part of each group that the other would accept or defer to some of its practices and values. Each counted on some degree of influence over the other, on being able to acculturate the other. Over the course of the first two years, however, leaders on both sides came to recognize how unrealistic were their earliest hopes. That recognition was grounded in the most common arena of contact, the field of trade. Settlers and natives would struggle with each other through five stages of exchange during 1607-1609 before their leaders finally grasped and confronted the critical differences between their peoples. Hindered earlier by a limited understanding of each other's ways, at the moment of deep insight Smith and Powhatan realized that neither could peacefully accommodate the other. Following their last fateful meeting, the relationship between the English and the Indians deteriorated inexorablyIncludes bibliographical references. </p>

Callahan suggests ways of achieving greater accuracy without jeopardizing the accessibility and goals of the Jamestown project. </p>

<p>Size: 40 x 46 cm. Scale: "about five miles, or say 1  leagues to an inch" (Brown, <title render="italic">Genesis of the United States</title>, 1:184 [ENTRY 112]) Oriented with west at the top, but the perspective is distorted. Extends from the Chesapeake Bay to west of Powhatan (Richmond). Jamestown is represented by a triangular fort on a large peninsula. This map is unique among early charts in that it portrays the fort in a manner consistent with contemporary descriptions. A dotted line indicates the route the Indians took with John Smith after his capture in December 1607. This chart must have been sent to England by Captain Francis Nelson, who left Virginia June 2, 1608... It illustrates Captain John Smith's 'True Relation,' and was sent from Virginia with it. The 'Relation' was published in August 1608; but I have never seen an engraving of this chart. (Brown, 1:184) The version of this chart which appeared in Brown (1:after 184) has a note indicating that the original was "sent from London, England, 10th Sept., 1608, by Zuniga, to the King of Spain."

West of Iacqueville, where the river branches, there is a larger settlement identified as Staat HenryVille. Forts are shown on either side of the mouth of the river. Most of the land appears to be cultivated; cattle are shown west of HenryVille. Armed settlers are depicted behind a barricade at the western edge of the chart. It might be assumed that Iacqueville and Staat HenryVille are Jamestown and Henrico respectively, but little else about this map suggests that the cartographer was familiar with Virginia's geography.

Five or six other structures form a row along the riverbank, and The Brick House is indicated on Back Creeke near the eastern end of the peninsula. The Swamp appears as a line running diagonally across the peninsula. In his letter Clayton suggests how to drain the swamp, describes how the isthmus floods in the spring tides forming "an absolute island," describes the two forts, and recommends Archers Hope Point as the best site for a fort.

<p>Size: 18.5 x 12.5 cm. Oriented with northeast at the top. This sketch shows the location of a Geological Survey station named Sheilds on the western side of the Old Earth-work of 1862 near the western end of James Id. The entire circumference of the earthwork is on land, with its southwest face parallel to, and very near, the bank of the James River. To the southeast of the earthwork are Old Ruins (Jamestown) and an Old Grave Yard. A Farm Road passes very close to the northeast side of the earthwork and the graveyard. The mouth of Back River is shown to the northwest. The accompanying page of handwritten text, which describes the station marker and signal, uses the spelling Shields and the name Jamestown Island and refers to the westernmost part of the island as Chester Pt.

Jamestown Island is separated from the mainland by The Thoroughfare. Goose Hill is indicated, and Jamestown appears in this area on the river near the eastern end of the island. Shields is indicated on the river near the western end. A few structures are shown, including what appears to be a large one near the center of the island. A road from the north approaches the island at the western end, crosses the creek onto the island, follows the southern perimeter and returns across the center, forming a loop. The western end of the loop is at what appears to be a pier, about one third of the way down the southwestern side of the island. Three areas are marked off with dotted lines but not identified. Markings apparently indicate marshes, wooded land, cleared land, and cultivated land or orchards. Similar markings are used on the mainland, but the only labels on the north side of the river are Deep Creek, Powhatan Creek, and Mill Creek. The charting does not extend as far as Williamsburg.

An adjacent area is identified as "Additional Land under consideration for the Site belonging to Mrs. Barney" (ca. 2.15 acres). The Road to Williamsburg crosses this latter area to connect to Jamestown Wharf. A second road, which comes from the bridge over Back River, crosses APVA land to the riverbank and proceeds to the southeast for about half a mile to a pier. The New Town area (not so labeled) has two structures and what appear to be trees positioned in such a pattern as to suggest an orchard. Available: CNHP, CW </p>

<p>Size: 68.5 x 56 cm. Scale: 1:24,000 (6.7 cm. = 1 mile) Covers the same area as the 1953 Surry chart (ENTRY 1036).  Island features are very similar to those on the earlier chart. There is no ferry dock on the island, however, and a more extensive network of roads is indicated across the island. A museum, a cemetery, and a visitor center are identified at Jamestown. Most of the non-marsh area of the island is enclosed in five-foot contour lines, and two small areas are shown to be above ten feet. The road onto the island is now the Colonial National Historical Parkway, which crosses a causeway and bridge connecting Glass House Point to Church Point and separating Sandy Bay from the James River. On the mainland, route 31 has been diverted to a new ferry dock near Jamestown Festival Park, just north of Glass House Point. Available: CW </p>

<p>Prepared for Marley Brown III, Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, by Bruce Bevan, Geosight, Pitman, N.J. Geophysical tests were conducted on Jamestown Island in the settlement area and in the Black Point area. The tests involved ground-penetrating radar, magnetometer, resistivity, and conductivity surveys. The radar appears to be the most successful at locating important features, while the magnetometer is second best; but the conductivity survey might be more valuable than the magnetic survey in locating prehistoric features. A final evaluation of the relative utility of these surveys, however, will be possible only after the completion of test excavations. Bibliography: 40. </p>

This supplement to the final report of <title render="italic">A Geophysical Test at Jamestown Island</title> (1993) is an initial evaluation of the test in light of excavations in the settlement area. It appears that the ground-penetrating radar and magnetic surveys have been the most revealing. Resistivity and conductivity measurements have been less successful. Magnetic surveying alone probably would be the most economical approach to further geophysical testing on the island. </p>

<p>Reports on late 1993 efforts at the northeastern corner of Jamestown Island to assess the efficacy of remote sensing techniques through ground truthing and to evaluate the effectiveness of shovel testing at 20-meter intervals as a means of identifying archaeological sites. Preliminary results on remote sensing were inconclusive but indicated that greater discretion in site selection would be appropriate. It was found that shovel testing at 20-meter intervals would identify virtually all sites. Three new archaeological sites were recorded in the four hectare (10 acre) area subjected to the trial survey. </p>

<p>A progress report on the island-wide archaeological survey involving shovel testing at twenty-meter intervals. With completion of the survey near, fifty sites have been identified and some patterns have become clear. The island has experienced human settlement for as long as the species has been present in the region, leaving a record 100 centuries long. Pre-colonial settlement was characterized by short-term, seasonal forays and affected by changes in the natural environment, especially those involving sea level. Outlying settlement in the seventeenth century consisted of small farmsteads which were consumed by larger plantation holdings in the eighteenth century. Settlement dwindled in the nineteenth century when the major sites were Civil War fortifications. A version of this paper was presented at the 1995 Mid-Atlantic Archaeological Conference. </p>

<p>Computerized geographic information systems (GISs) offer a powerful tool for the storage and analysis of the diverse sets of information created in multidisciplinary archaeological projects. GISs provide both sophisticated data management and archiving and a geographic component which allows this information to be related to the analytic units to which archaeologists are accustomed--structures, features, and excavation squares. The potential uses of this form of information management are described with examples from the Jamestown Archaeological Assessment. Using GeoSys, a system developed by English archaeologist Dominic Powlesland, the advantages of geographic information management are illustrated for collection, data analysis, and the final overall site archive. </p>

<p>Reports on a study of an early industrial, or craft, enclave in the northwest portion of New Towne. The study involves the reanalysis of artifacts and documentation from earlier excavations, combined with historical research and information garnered through current, predominantly nonintrusive, archaeological exploration. Efforts to create manufacturing at Jamestown appear to have been spearheaded by individuals and to have continued after tobacco emerged as Virginia's chief export product. An early proponent of manufacturing was Governor John Harvey, who has been associated with the northwest enclave area where evidence suggests sites for distilling medicinal remedies and producing bricks and pottery. This article is a summary of part of the author's doctoral dissertation in the Department of Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania (ENTRY 69). A version of this article, under the title "'By Our Industry and Plantation of Comodious Merchandize:' Early Manufacturing at Jamestown," appeared in the <title render="italic">Colonial Williamsburg Foundation Research Review 6</title>, no. 1 (1995/96): 18-21. </p>

<p>Describes a case study undertaken as part of the Jamestown Archaeological Assessment. In order to understand the nature of industrial development at Jamestown, the case study focused on an early industrial zone in the northwest portion of New Towne. The enclave, which was linked to Governor John Harvey in the 1630s, reveals evidence of a structure used as a brewhouse and apothecary as well as a structure housing kilns for brick, tile, and pottery production. The eventual failure of the craft activities in the enclave zone highlights both the extent to which development at Jamestown was linked to individuals and also the difficulties encountered when attempting to create alternative commodities to tobacco. </p>

<p>England's settlement at Jamestown could be called the South's first urban planning disaster. Current archaeological research, however, is allowing for a critical analysis of this legendary "failure." Evidence of abandoned industries and speculatively-built houses highlights a concerted, if ultimately unsuccessful, effort to create an urban settlement reflective of British ports and industrial centers. Comparative analysis of development and demographics in Jamestown with those in other seventeenth-century British towns provides a context within which to understand the expectations of Virginia's urban planners and to evaluate the nature of urbanism in the colonial South.

<p>Man has made nearly continuous use of Jamestown Island for 11,000 years. With the Holocene rise of sea level, the landscape and aquatic environments have changed. These alterations have influenced human uses of the area. At the beginning of the Holocene, Jamestown stood more than 30 meters above the James River. Archaeological evidence indicates that Paleoindian and Archaic people frequented the "island" and its now-submerged fringes. These sites outnumber those post-dating 3,000 years BP by 2 to 1. By 5,000 years BP, sea level had risen to approximately -7 meters. The James had widened and become tidal and brackish. Marshes quickly closed in along freshwater streams. The ephemeral nature of Middle and Late Woodland sites is attributed in part to the decline in fresh surface-water. In 1607 sea level was 0.6 to 0.9 meters lower than today, and the western end of Jamestown still was connected to the mainland. By the end of the seventeenth century, erosion had severed this connection. The progressive inundation probably contributed to the decline of agriculture on the island during the nineteenth century. </p>

<p>Pollen analysis of historical archaeological deposits is difficult in the South where there is no season of frozen ground to retard pollen percolation and protect pollen from the oxygen in groundwater. The comparative pollen analysis of profile and artifact samples from Refuse Pit 1, however, indicate that data relative to both local edaphic and land-use conditions and more regional land-use trends can be recovered from under flat stones and artifacts and from the corrosion influenced sediment immediately surrounding metal artifacts in deposits where pollen exposed to percolation does not survive.

<p>A berm at the west side of a field on the north edge of Jamestown Island, on a parcel once owned by Richard Kingsmill, was selected for exploratory pollen analysis. The objectives were to determine the quality of pollen preservation in and under the berm, to examine the pollen spectrum created by the cultural process of throwing up the berm, and to ascertain the length of the pollen record under such relatively small earthworks in the Jamestown area. The data reveal that both the seventeenth-century pollen under the berm and some of that thrown up in constructing the berm are preserved, thus indicating that such earthworks are adequate to preserve seventeenth-century pollen from percolation and the agents of degradation.

<p>Fort, Jamestown, Virginia." Paper presented at the 29th annual meeting of the Society for Historical Archaeology, Pittsburgh, January 1996. Pollen analysis of deposits in a core from a ditch associated with the 1665 Turf Fort at Jamestown indicates bare, slightly weedy local conditions around artisan dwellings on the waterfront and the Virginia forest in the background before construction of the fort; goosefoot dominating the earthwork slope; close relatives of the goldenrods initially dominating the ditch bottom after construction; and the appearance of sedges recording wetter conditions later in the open-ditch period. Pollen percolation rates adjusted for plowing and applied to ragweed-type (Ambrosia-type) percentages suggest that cultivation over the ditch began ca. 1729, while pollen concentrations under archaeological backdirt served to separate pre- and post-1956 park vegetation records. Variations in pollen record formation processes critical to the preservation of the vegetation record suggest that pollen analysis may serve as an economical, nonintrusive substitute for extensive excavations in evaluations of non-threatened sites.

<p>A comparative study of a stratigraphic pollen profile exposed to the elements at the surface and a series of pollen samples sheltered by artifacts was conducted with materials from a seventeenth-century refuse pit at Jamestown. Pollen was recovered both from under rocks and artifacts lying flat or concave side down and from around iron objects. The shallowest pollen spectrum recovered from under an artifact was 25 cm. below the deepest pollen preserved in the exposed stratigraphic profile. No pollen was found in unsheltered pollen samples at the same depths as the artifacts. The distributions demonstrate that the pollen associated with the seventeenth-century artifacts is contemporaneous with those artifacts; it did not percolate down from later deposits. The artifact pollen spectra were arranged by depth into an artificial profile and appear to record a series of edaphic changes in the pit and a land-clearance episode in the Jamestown area.

<p>Fragments of ceramic roofing tile from sites in Jamestown and Williamsburg were analyzed to determine links to three seventeenth-century brick and tile kilns, two in Jamestown and one at Bruton Heights in Williamsburg. Roofing tile from Structure 102, one of the Jamestown kilns, and Structure 111, a trash pit, were determined to be related. Likewise, the waster tile recovered from Structure 100 on the Page-Chiles tract was linked to Structure 65, the kiln located nearby. Unexpectedly, Structure 21 was linked to the Bruton Heights kiln. While the results are intriguing, they are only preliminary. The sample size should be increased and more sites included before the results can be considered valid.
