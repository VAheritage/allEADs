         (1820) of Thomas Jefferson's thoughts on the education of

          <p>Narrative diary of John Taylor Barraud, U.S. Navy,
               while serving on the John Adams, a 20-gun sloop of war.
               5 page typed summary included. The diary covers the time
               from Barraud's arrival by ship in Norfolk, Virginia,
               after an absence of 3 years. In early 1845, he goes to
               New York, N.Y. for assignment on the John Adams, which
               later travels to Pensacola, Florida and then to the
               Mexican coast. A large part of the diary consists of
               comments while sailing between Pensacola and Mexico,
               includes comments on the land, sea, and diplomatic
               aspects of the Mexican War. In late October, 1846,
               Barraud sails to Boston, Massachusetts, from whence he
               travels to New York, New York, Philadelphia,
               Pennsylvania, Baltimore, Maryland, Portsmouth, Virginia,
               the U.S. Naval Academy, Richmond, Virginia, via canal to
               the mountains, and back to the Academy.</p>
