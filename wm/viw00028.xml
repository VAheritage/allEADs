         Co. G., 1st Battalion, 12th U.S. Infanty, 1861-1864. He fought
         mostly in Virginia and Maryland, returning to Maryland three
         times between 1863-1864 to defend it. After two months
         hospitalization in Pennsylvania and a furlough in New York,
         Golding returns to Virginia in November 1864 to fight until
