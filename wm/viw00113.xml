unworthiness for his present occupation. Clergy in Virginia poor in quality. Asks James to advise his brother, who seems inclined to come out to Virginia; he should persevere in his attempt to take orders, in
which case Boucher may, if he prospers, be able to get him preferment.

school at Port Royal; Captain Dixon [Mr. Younger's agent] although a worthy man, and the company he keeps in America, would not appeal to his brother. Repeats his request to assist Mr. Younger in recommending an
usher to succeed him at Port Royal. Requests James to mark his recommendations in a book catalogue he has ordered.

            <p>Urges James to write. Maury is seriously ill. Disturbance over the terrible Stamp Act which is "oppressive, impolitic and illegal;" Parliament has not right to impose it upon us; he also grieves at Government's
policy in India. Asks James to help him find an usher, though his school is still in rather a precarious position. Expresses sorrow at the death of his elder brother and wishes to know if he succeeds to the
Blencogo estate. Now has respect for Americans and does not intend to settle in England again. Reason for declining grammar master place at William and Mary.

            <p>His return to England is not yet likely; his school is flourishing with 17 boys at £20 p.a. for board and education. Contrasts situation and methods of presentment of the clergy in Virginia and Maryland
in favour of the latter, but hopes of preferment there have been spoiled by arrival of Rev. Benedict Allen and "a lady he calls his sister"; American clergy, especially converted Scotch Presbyterians, are in bad
repute. Expresses his admiration for "our airy American girls" and his hopes of marrying Mrs. Judith Chase, a young widow of respectable fortune. Accounts of his friends Mr. Addison [Rev. Henry Addison of Prince
George's County, Maryland] and Mr. Maury, whose scheme to settle in the West was put a stop to by the unjust and impolitic Royal Proclamation against further settlements. Thanks him for "Friendly Intentions"
toward his sister-in-law. Asks his reaction to the "Demise of Dr. Brown."

            <p>He believes that the present troubles in America are due less to the Stamp Act and Duties on tea than to a "principle of revolt innate in all colonies"; the British constitution is not well adapted to the
ruling of colonies, but as colonies are so important to Britain, she should profit by past errors; any accommodation reached must be of a permanent nature; American institutions cherish Republicanism but various
English men from Chatham to Priestley have helped kindle this flame; in America, members of the Church of England, particularly the clergy, have remained loyal in spite of persecution.

the Bishop of Bangor [John Moore 1730-1805], and his brother the Under Secretary of State [William Eden, 1st Lord Auckland 1744-1814]. Boucher has discussed America with Lord George Germain, the new American
Secretary. The large numbers of American refugees make it difficult to obtain preferment, but Dr. Cooper [see B/2] has given up his curacy of Paddington, worth £70 p.a. to Boucher; Boucher has left lands and
slaves in America worth £5000 and has brought only £200 with him; he will find it difficult to support the orphans at Blencogo [possibly Kitty and Betty Strange who appear in later letters as protegees
of Boucher]. Problems with repaying his debt to James. Asks to raise debt to £200.

            <p>His sister and her husband are still in financial difficulties but he wishes the lease renewed and is sending them £20 to buy new stock. He has completed a pamphlet on America and hopes the Government may
reward him. The British in America seem irresolute and shilly-shallying. Both Clinton and the Howes have offered pardons to rebels; New Jersey regiment has taken offer. A horrid business at Bristol; suspicion fall
on Americans &amp; Patriots; Boucher blames "fanatical Republicans." Literary comments.

            <p>Is now resolved not to give a new lease to his brother-in-law; he has a very low opinion of him, and of his sister for marrying him. Has read a translation of the New Testament by Edward Harwood [D.N.B.] who is
part of the Priestley, Price, Evans corps, but thinks it "coxcomical"; his own pamphlet needs rewriting. Dr. Cooper's Oxford sermon is excellent, and the new Archbishop of York [William Markham] has spoken out for
the American church; advises James not to buy The Spirit of Athens a piece of nonsense by William Young [D.N.B.]. The American situation is not promising; "the check and defeat of the Hessians"; flight of [Rev.]
Mr. [Henry] Addison's curate from Maryland; he is resigned to the loss of his property but fears for his friends.

two- thirds of Washington's army are not Americans. The British Government is rotten at the core, and speeches in Parliament are seditious and treasonable. Is interested in the writing of local history of
Cumberland and study of dialects; North America has a pure and uniform pronunciation of the English tongue; distress over Burgoyre's defeat [Saratoga].

James for some contributions. Mr. Bassenthwaite, who has a school and parish on the Island of Tortola, is looking for an assistant. Nelly's rheumatism is bad, but her physician Dr. Moore is hopeful. Boucher was
unable to fore the result of the American war; "If the Rebels seem to have been more successful, they owe it not to their superior wisdom, but superior villainy. And yet, from Howe to Koppel, I firmly believe, all
our misfortunes are owing to the incapacity of our Commanders . . . . . Thirteen Colonies, the majority of whose inhabitants wished not to be so lost, yet have been lost." Probably the French and certainly the
Spanish have fared worse than Britain. His affairs in Maryland like the times have turned "Topsy Turvy."

Jones of Nayland, D.N.B.]; illness among his scholars is causing him grave anxiety.

his house. The situation in America now seems more hopeful. Prospect of Maryland being recovered because of quarrels amongst its leaders. Has received many letters favorable to his wishes concerning America.
Washington has asked to be remembered to him, and a neighbour in Mayland is making overtures; the library of Tophan Beauclerk is to be sold, "it is said to be the largest and best ever exposed to sale"; catalogues
will be printed and sold after Christmas. Boucher's school is diminishing, and will soon be reduced to eight pupils.

[probably Letters on a Regicide Peace] will have on the public mind; the "speechifyings" in Parliament have been very poor - "this is not an age of great men."

anything else", or to Grubb, but to young Banister; Boucher is not optimistic as to its success.

            <p>There is a principle of revolt in all colonies which stems from a lack of foresight in colony administration; the subduing of the rebellion in America is of secondary importance to the new-modelling of its
Government. Says focus of the war should be placed on New England. Decisive action against Washington is imperative to the British cause. New York is well- disposed and would make a good base for the King's
troops. Advocates control of New York from New York City to Albany to split the northern colonies from the southern. Pennsylvania has made no overt act of treason nor raised any troops; the Carolinias, Virginia
and Maryland are too busy with internal problems, i.e. Indians and slaves, to seek regular troops in a hostile way; the white servants would certainly enlist with the King's troops, Baltimore and Annapolis contain
many such men; trade embargos should be sufficient to deal with these colonies. Washington shows extraordinary coolness and caution but has very little personal experience; the first general action against him
must be decisive.

            <p>He has declined position of Principal Minister of the English Episcopal Chapel in Edinburgh because the Scottish Anglicans refuse to render obedience to the Scottish bishops; he asks the Bishop to assist the
cause of Scottish Union which he has so long supported. Edinburgh is captivated with popular preaching; even Bp. Abernethy Drummond stipulates that the English assistant he requires must be a good preacher.
Cautioned Bp. Drummond to be cautious in his choice because his mitre might well come down to his chosen person.

            <p>He does not expect Douglas, in his present state of health, to play any active part in promoting Scottish Union, but he might certainly use his influence to remove prejudice. He has advised Bp. Drummond, who is
apt to be intemperate in his zeal, and Bp. Skinner [of Aberdeen] to write an address to the English Bishops, and he suggests that Douglas should write to the Episcopal Congregations of Edinburgh. The obstacle of
the Abjuration Oath will soon be removed as it will doubtless be repealed on the death of the Cardinal of New York, which may be daily expected.

voting an award of £2500 to Mr. Randolph for defending the House's opposition to the Governor's demand for a pistole for every land patent he signed because the Virginia presses did not wish to offend the
Governor and his council. Boucher need not fear to be discovered as the author, as it will recommend him to the most sensible, equitable, and honest part of the Clergy and Laity. Maury comments extensively on his
regard for Boucher. Boucher should get Mr. Jackson's opinion of the work. Tickell is to accompany Maury to Hanover Court where his case is to be heard.

            <p>[In 1760, the Crown had disallowed an Act passed by the Virginia Assembly to prevent clergy of the Established Church, whose salaries had hitherto been calculated in tobacco, from profiting by a heavy rise in
its price. Patrick Henry began his political career by opposing Maury's claim for arrears in the "Parson's Cause".] The jury was not of persons of rank and understanding, and although the verdict was in favour of
the plaintiff, only one penny damages was awarded; the Jury had been harangued by one of the Defendant's lawyers [Patrick Henry] who asserted "that the King, by annulling and disallowing laws of so salutary a
nature [the Two Penny Act of 1758], from being the Father of his people, degenerates into a tyrant and forfeits all right to his subjects' obedience;" at which there were cries of Treason! The road to popularity
here is to trample underfoot the Interests of Religion, the Rights of the Church, and the Prorogative of the Crown.

of Boucher's second wife] made a handsome profit on the hops he bought. Stevens is staying with the Dean of Canterbury [George Horne] who will look over Boucher's papers. The Dean wonders why Boucher would put
"the history of the rebellion in sermon form."

for his mother's use; but he has had it in his possession for five months, and neither Tom nor Anthony has mentioned it before. He has discussed the [Monthly?] Review with Robinson who would accept articles and
reviews from divines "sound in the faith"; the printing of the John Bull pamphlet would cost £2 per thousand copies.

regard; Post has told Boucher that marriages have diminished, so Stevens was comforted for the future of the world when he found that bastardy increased in the same proportion. Boucher need not fear to be thought
a Low Churchman and may sit on the right hand of Nobody at the next meeting [Nobody's club, founded in Stevens' honour in 1800, was known for its High Church principles]; but how can he think Lord Kinnoull a
sensible honest man when he is no better than a Presbyterian? He hopes Boucher will see Anthony Richardson while he is in England. Sir Frederick [Eden] will be an excellent neighbour.

manuscript. Frank [Randolph] has published some sermons. He sees from the papers that Sir F. [Frederick Eden] is Chairman of the Flour Company. One of Stevens' brother-auditors has just died so he is now senior
auditor. The Rector [of Otham] has made £400 from hops, the young Squire about £4000.

            <p>He warns Boucher not to expect great things from his letters; he bears news of him through Tom Calverley and John Richardson; Boucher has been having trouble with his agent for his property in the North; it is
surprising that he has not learned from experience. He is sorry to hear that Boucher has had trouble with his assistant; he hopes that the connection with Frere may take place [probably the position was offered to
one of John Frere's sons]; he is glad that Boucher takes more kindly to "pupilizing" and suggests that he asks Tom Hooker, who has a school at Rottingdean, for recommendations. Has Boucher noticed the Bagdon
business?

necessarily productive of works is a most dangerous error, a true Child of Enthusiasm. An explanation of his reasoning on that point.

            <p>Sir Richard Hill is to reply to Daubeny's answer; all Calvinists are the spawn of the Scotch Covenanters and, were it in their power, would be just as intolerant; Daubeny has also been attacked by a brother
clergyman. Of some parts of Mrs. More's writings he has as high an opinion as Boucher, but as she has it in her power to do so much good, he wishes her to be "wholly with us"; however, the difference is in
expression rather than idea. He will use his influence at Winchester College [where he was a Fellow] on behalf of Boucher's son, but application for admission should be made immediately; he will find out about
fees when his own boys come home for Christmas.

Episcopal Chapel in Edinburgh] and, wishing him to be replaced by a minister of the Church of England has written to Boucher [see also A/4a-b]; however, Bp. Watson Richard Watson, Bp. of Llandaff, D.N.B.] has

            <p>He has read through Boucher's papers and returns them with his comments. The tenet that Faith is necessarily productive is very near the Calvinistic doctrine of the irresistibility of divine Grace; as long as
Mrs. More continues to frequent independent chapels he will doubt her attachment to the Church of England; he gives her credit for much good done on the best principle, but not for the best judgment or the best
information. When he has time, he will tell Boucher more about the Bp. of London, whom he thinks neither sound nor honest.
