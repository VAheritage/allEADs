                  <p>Is glad to hear Nelson has been healthy here they
                  have had dysentery and diarrhea but no losses; tells
                  Nelson to sell the rest of his wheat as best he can
                  and from that money to pay Mrs. Nelson her $1000;
                  hopes she will wait for payment of the interest on it
                  as he has other debts to pay; has been truly
                  economical spending only on essentials for his family
                  and on manure for his fields; hopefully the next crop
                  will solve his problems.</p>

                  fishery on the Potomac is the best for March in 20
                  years; any money to be spared can be used, for it is

                  River and its branches in New Kent, Hanover and King
                  William counties; corn prices are up in Europe and

                  severe weather set in; Nelson did well to get 90
                  cents for his wheat; corn is at 60 cents; is proud of
                  the improvements Nelson has made on his estate;
                  "indeed it may be fairly said the Old Virginia is
                  rising from the dead"; Nelson and Mr. [Edmund?]
                  Ruffin should publish a memoir Improvements on the
                  Pamunkey so as to aid others by their success.</p>

                  <p>Feels Nelson received a good price for the wheat,
                  but if war comes to Europe prices will go up; Col.
                  [Robert E.] Lee is here with Custis's grandchildren
                  and Custis will soon go to West Point [New York] for
                  his health; it is good Nelson is fallowing for wheat,
                  twenty years ago this was unheard of; they are
                  talking again of a railroad to the Pamunkey; wants
                  Nelson to get it to cross the "White House"

                  "White House" is the nearest point to deep navigable
                  water on the Pamunkey they should try to get the
                  route as it would greatly cut their distance to
                  market; the price of wheat in New York, $2.56, is the
                  highest ever in the United States; as a consequence
                  land is at an astounding price for example, $100 an
                  acre unimproved in Fairfax; corn is also on the rise;

                  crops will not go to Richmond, but to West Point or
                  Baltimore, where he has had satisfactory dealings and
                  where higher prices compensate for the distance;
                  reports that he wants to own no more "Negro
                  property," of which he has $100,000 worth; notes that

                  for selling his Lower Country Wheat Crop for $17,000;
