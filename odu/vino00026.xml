         <p>Beverly Randolph Middleton was born on September 7, 1928,
         in Norfolk County, Virginia. He graduated from Norview High
         School where he was a gifted athlete and a central force in
         both Norview's football and basketball varsity programs. After
         high school he began his university career at the Virginia
         Polytechnic Institute where again his athletic abilities stood
         out as a member and co-captain of the track and field team.
         Middleton finished his University career at VPI graduating
         with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical
         Engineering.</p>
         <p>At VPI Middleton was enrolled in the Army cadet program.
         After college he joined the U.S. Army, and served from 1951 to
         1953, attaining the rank of Captain. He was stationed in
         Europe where he received a special commendation from Queen
         Julianne of the Netherlands for his devoted and persevering
         personal assistance in coming to aid in a time of national
         crisis.</p>
         <p>In 1967 Middleton was elected to the Virginia House of
         Delegates representing the city of Virginia Beach on a
         Democratic Union party ticket that opposed the Kellam Machine.
         He was a member of the House of Delegates from 1968 until
         1974, having been defeated in his bid for re-election in 1973.
         He served three consecutive terms. The five committees on
         which he served were: Appropriations, Education, Roads,
         Chesapeake Bay and its Tributaries, and Conservation and
         Natural Resources. From 1972 to 1982 he was a member,
         appointed by the Governor of Virginia, of both the Virginia
         Housing Study Commission and the State Board of Housing and
         Development. Middleton also served as a member of the
         Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel Commission and on the General
         Advisory Council for Vocational Education for Virginia Beach
         schools.</p>
         <p>Beverly R. Middleton was a licensed professional engineer
         and retired as president of Middleton Construction Company. He
         was a member of several organizations including the Society of
         Professional Engineers and the Builders and Contractors
         Exchange. He served as director of the latter organization. He
         chaired the Joint Apprenticeship Committee of the Tidewater
         Electrical Industry from 1961 to 1974. He also served as
         president of the Suburban Kiwanis Club and Thoroughgood Civic
         League and was a member of the Royal Order of the Neptune
         Festival and Bayside Presbyterian Church.</p>
         <p>Middleton died on July 12, 1996, was married twice and is
         survived by his second wife, Ernestine W. Middleton. He
         fathered three sons and four daughters: John Middleton, Barry
         Knight, Wayne Middleton, Shannon Knight, Gale Dunlap, Beverly
         Middleton Hathaway, and Terry Burton. He was active in

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The papers of Beverly R. Middleton deal primarily with his
         athletic career at Virginia Polytechnic Institute from 1945
         until 1949 and his political career from 1967 to 1974. The
         collection provides an adequate look at Beverly R. Middleton's
         athletic career at VPI.</p>
         <p>The political aspects of the collection which concentrate
         heavily on his election and re-election campaigns in 1967,
         1969, and 1971 as well as political correspondence from 1970
         until mid-1971 provide a genuine examination of his political
         aspirations. Included in this collection is some sparse
         material that gives hints to both his athletic career at
         Norview High School and his career after he left the Virginia
         House of Delegates. The collection provides a perspective look
         into the growth of Middleton's public image from a star
         athlete to a Virginia Beach delegate.</p>
         <p>The documents and materials in the Beverly R. Middleton
         collection are divided into eight series entitled in order of
         appearance: correspondence, campaign files, organizations,
         printed material, photographs, artifacts, newspaper clippings,
         and scrapbooks.</p>

         two sub-series separated by year while the third sub-series
         consists of invitations and thank you letters. The political
         correspondence is divided by topic and consists mostly of
         letters from concerned citizens with replies from Delegate
         Middleton concerning specific legislation. Personal
         correspondence as well as invitations to several inaugurations
         for the governors of Virginia from 1978 to 1990 constitutes
         the last sub-series in this series.</p>
         <p>Among the correspondence are letters composed by citizens
         concerning the Save Old Dominion University campaign of 1970,
         letters from Congressman G. William Whitehurst regarding
         Boater Safety, personal invitations and correspondence with
         Governor John B. Dalton, and a personal thank you letter and
         autographed photo from Congressman Thomas N. Downing. Also,
         there is a Table of Contents outlining correspondence from
         1971.</p>

         campaign volunteers and poll workers, campaign stationery,
         press releases and speeches made by Middleton during his
         election and re-election campaigns, and a poll book
         registration of voters who voted on September 14, 1971. Items
         of note are handwritten notes and documents pertaining to the
         1971 Middleton Campaign Fund which include a list of
         contributors in 1971 and a compilation of registered voters by
