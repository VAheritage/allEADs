         <p>Beverly Randolph Middleton was born on September 7, 1928,
         in Norfolk County, Virginia. He graduated from Norview High
         School where he was a gifted athlete and a central force in
         both Norview's football and basketball varsity programs. After
         high school he began his university career at the Virginia
         Polytechnic Institute where again his athletic abilities stood
         out as a member and co-captain of the track and field team.
         Middleton finished his University career at VPI graduating
         with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical
         Engineering.</p>
         <p>At VPI Middleton was enrolled in the Army cadet program.
         After college he joined the U.S. Army, and served from 1951 to
         1953, attaining the rank of Captain. He was stationed in
         Europe where he received a special commendation from Queen
         Julianne of the Netherlands for his devoted and persevering
         personal assistance in coming to aid in a time of national
         crisis.</p>
         <p>In 1967 Middleton was elected to the Virginia House of
         Delegates representing the city of Virginia Beach on a
         Democratic Union party ticket that opposed the Kellam Machine.
         He was a member of the House of Delegates from 1968 until
         1974, having been defeated in his bid for re-election in 1973.
         He served three consecutive terms. The five committees on
         which he served were: Appropriations, Education, Roads,
         Chesapeake Bay and its Tributaries, and Conservation and
         Natural Resources. From 1972 to 1982 he was a member,
         appointed by the Governor of Virginia, of both the Virginia
         Housing Study Commission and the State Board of Housing and
         Development. Middleton also served as a member of the
         Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel Commission and on the General
         Advisory Council for Vocational Education for Virginia Beach
         schools.</p>
         <p>Beverly R. Middleton was a licensed professional engineer
         and retired as president of Middleton Construction Company. He
         was a member of several organizations including the Society of
         Professional Engineers and the Builders and Contractors
         Exchange. He served as director of the latter organization. He
         chaired the Joint Apprenticeship Committee of the Tidewater
         Electrical Industry from 1961 to 1974. He also served as
         president of the Suburban Kiwanis Club and Thoroughgood Civic
         League and was a member of the Royal Order of the Neptune
         Festival and Bayside Presbyterian Church.</p>
         <p>Middleton died on July 12, 1996, was married twice and is
         survived by his second wife, Ernestine W. Middleton. He
         fathered three sons and four daughters: John Middleton, Barry
         Knight, Wayne Middleton, Shannon Knight, Gale Dunlap, Beverly
         Middleton Hathaway, and Terry Burton. He was active in
         coaching little league football and basketball and enjoyed

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The papers of Beverly R. Middleton deal primarily with his
         athletic career at Virginia Polytechnic Institute from 1945
         until 1949 and his political career from 1967 to 1974. The
         collection provides an adequate look at Beverly R. Middleton's
         athletic career at VPI.</p>
         <p>The political aspects of the collection which concentrate
         heavily on his election and re-election campaigns in 1967,
         1969, and 1971 as well as political correspondence from 1970
         until mid-1971 provide a genuine examination of his political
         aspirations. Included in this collection is some sparse
         material that gives hints to both his athletic career at
         Norview High School and his career after he left the Virginia
         House of Delegates. The collection provides a perspective look
         into the growth of Middleton's public image from a star
         athlete to a Virginia Beach delegate.</p>
         <p>The documents and materials in the Beverly R. Middleton
         collection are divided into eight series entitled in order of
         appearance: correspondence, campaign files, organizations,
         printed material, photographs, artifacts, newspaper clippings,
         and scrapbooks.</p>

         <head>Organization</head>
         <p>The documents and materials in the Beverly R. Middleton
         collection are divided into eight series entitled in order of
         appearance: correspondence, campaign files, organizations,
         printed material, photographs, artifacts, newspaper clippings,
         and scrapbooks.</p>
         <p>
         <emph render="bold">Series I - Correspondence</emph>
         <lb />The majority of materials in this series consists mostly
         of political correspondence written between 1970 and 1971. The
         folder inventory of this series is separated into three
         sub-series. Correspondence from 1970 and 1971 is divided into
         two sub-series separated by year while the third sub-series
         consists of invitations and thank you letters. The political
         correspondence is divided by topic and consists mostly of
         letters from concerned citizens with replies from Delegate
         Middleton concerning specific legislation. Personal
         correspondence as well as invitations to several inaugurations
         for the governors of Virginia from 1978 to 1990 constitutes
         the last sub-series in this series.</p>
         <p>Among the correspondence are letters composed by citizens
         concerning the Save Old Dominion University campaign of 1970,
         letters from Congressman G. William Whitehurst regarding
         Boater Safety, personal invitations and correspondence with
         Governor John B. Dalton, and a personal thank you letter and
         autographed photo from Congressman Thomas N. Downing. Also,
         there is a Table of Contents outlining correspondence from
         1971.</p>
         <p>
         <emph render="bold">Series II - Campaign Files</emph>
         <lb />The material in this series includes packet guides for
         campaign volunteers and poll workers, campaign stationery,
         press releases and speeches made by Middleton during his
         election and re-election campaigns, and a poll book
         registration of voters who voted on September 14, 1971. Items
         of note are handwritten notes and documents pertaining to the
         1971 Middleton Campaign Fund which include a list of
         contributors in 1971 and a compilation of registered voters by
         counties/cities as of January 1, 1970.</p>
         <p>
         <emph render="bold">Series III - Organizations</emph>
         <lb />The papers in this series include correspondence from
         the Virginia Beach Women's Democratic Club and a flyer from
         the Thoroughgood Garden Club. Papers of interest include
         correspondence, newspaper clippings, and other documents
         pertaining to the Virginia Building Officials Conference.</p>
         <p>
         <emph render="bold">Series IV - Printed Material</emph>
         <lb />This series consists of a printed newsletter and an
         official program for a sporting event sponsored by Kiwanis
         International. Middleton was a member and also served as
         president of the Suburban Kiwanis Club. The Virginia Housing
         Development Authority - 1982 Annual Report also appears in
         this series. The most prominent item of special interest
         however is an official program from the testimonial dinner
         honoring Senator Harry F. Byrd, Jr., with the establishment of
         an endowment fund in his name at the Virginia Military
         Institute.</p>
	<p>
	<emph render="bold">Series V - Photographs</emph>
	<lb />The photographs in this series include: a photo of the Norview High School football team, Middleton in track and field attire and cadet uniforms, and Middleton presiding over a Kiwanis Club conference. Of note are photographs of Governor Linwood Holton with State Senator James Turk, presiding over a press conference after the Virginia Housing Study Commissions Final Report on the housing crisis. </p>
	<p>
	<emph render="bold">Series VI - Artifacts</emph>
	<lb />This series contains Virginia Delegate license plates, a cocktail napkin from the Middleton campaign, and a bumper sticker from a Middleton re-election campaign. </p>
	<p>
	<emph render="bold">Series VII - Newspaper Clippings</emph>
	<lb />The newspaper articles in this series concern both Middleton's election and re-election campaigns and his family. There are several miscellaneous newspaper clippings, which concern Middleton's family from 1938 to 1941. </p>
	<p>
	<emph render="bold">Series VIII - Scrapbooks</emph>
	<lb />The four scrapbooks in this series are relatively intact; however, there are certain items which have been displaced and are now located in folders of their own. The four scrapbooks in this series each relate to a specific time frame. Scrapbook I is a compilation of items related to either Middleton's athletic career at VPI or his career as a Cadet in Company "B" from 1945 to 1949. The scrapbook also mentions his high school athletic career. The other three scrapbooks incorporate Middleton's political career including his election and re-election campaigns for the Virginia House of Delegates. Each scrapbook focuses on one particular campaign: 1967 United Campaign and Democratic primary, 1969 re-election campaign, and 1971 re-election campaign. In the scrapbooks concerning Middleton's re-election campaigns of 1969 and 1971 there are several items which relate to his tenure in the Virginia House of Delegates in that particular time frame.</p>
