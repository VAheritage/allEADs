         <p>The Union Army during the Civil War was essentially a
         volunteer army. To become an Officer of Volunteers, one only
         needed to raise a company. Often prominent and wealthy
         citizens used their money and influence to sign up a hundred
         men or so to make up their company. At the beginning of the
         war, this was fairly easy to do, as the enthusiasm for
         fighting for the Union was high.</p>
         <p>The Union Army of the Potomac was itself a largely
         volunteer army. In August of 1861 the Union Army of the
         Potomac formed by merging commands in Washington, Northern
         Virginia, and the Shenandoah. In Virginia, the primary battles
         took place between the Union Army of the Potomac and the
         Confederate Army of the Potomac (later renamed the Army of
         Northern Virginia in 1862). The two forces fought at the
         battles of Antietam, Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg, Seven
         Days, The Wilderness, Bull Run, and Gettysburg. The Union Army
         of the Potomac was led during these times by such generals, as
         George McClellan, Ambrose Burnside, and George G. Meade.</p>
         <p>Born in 1815, William Henry French was a veteran of the
         Mexican wars. He was appointed a Major General during the
         Civil War in November 1862. He commanded troops at Antietam,
         Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Manassas Gap, Auburn,
         Kelly's Ford, Brandy Station, and in the Mine Run operation.
         Meade considered French personally responsible for the failure
         at Mine Run. When the Army of the Potomac reorganized that
         winter, French was displaced and saw no further field service.
         He continued in the regular army until 1880 when he retired as
         Colonel 4th Artillery. He died in 1881.</p>
