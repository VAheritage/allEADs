         <p>The USS Vulcan (AR-5), a 50-year veteran of naval service,
         easily ranks as one of the U.S. Navy's most historic repair
         vessels. The USS Vulcan Collection was established to preserve
         the long record of repair support logged by the men and women
         who have served aboard the Atlantic Fleet's oldest active ship
         (second in the entire Navy) over the years. In addition, the
         collection also includes some material pertaining to the first
         and second Vulcans. The Vulcan was based in Norfolk from 1954
         until her decommissioning in 1991.</p>
         <p>The first Vulcan was commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard
         on May 31, 1898. Her commanding officer was Commander Ira
         Harris. Originally named Chatham, the fourteen year-old
         steamship was purchased by the Navy Department from the
         Merchants and Miners Transportation Company, a Baltimore firm,
         on May 2, 1898. Envisioned as a floating, mobile workshop and
         store ship, the repair vessel was needed to support the
         American fleet then operating off the southeastern coast of
         Cuba. Renamed Vulcan, conversion work began at a rapid pace,
         with completion ending about four weeks later. As recognized
         by the Naval Historical Center, Vulcan was now, "the fleet's
         first repair ship."</p>
         <p>After a brief stop in Newport News, Virginia, Vulcan
         arrived in the waters off Santiago de Cuba on July 1, 1898.
         Following the decisive American victory on July 3, Vulcan was
         given the task to repair and salvage two captured, badly
         damaged Spanish vessels, the Maria Teresa and the Cristobal
         Colon. Over the next few months, Vulcan made repairs to over
         fifty ships and brought badly needed stores to a like number
         while attached to the American fleet in Cuba.</p>
         <p>As hostilities subsided, Vulcan was recalled to the United
         States, where she underwent a refitting period at the Norfolk
         Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth. Her services no longer required,
         Vulcan was decommissioned in January 1899. Her impressive
         performance prompted the Chief, Bureau of Steam Engineering to
         recommend the procurement of a similar repair ship for the
         Pacific fleet.</p>
         <p>The second Vulcan (Collier No. 5), a coal ship, was
         commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard on October 2, 1909. Her
         initial crew was from another collier, the Lebanon, which was
         decommissioned at the yard on the same day. Vulcan's first
         commanding officer was Captain Jere Merrithew, USN. Prior to
         the First World War, Vulcan operated out of Norfolk and
         Portsmouth, New Hampshire, delivering coal and stores to the
         fleet along the East Coast and various Caribbean islands.</p>
         <p>During World War I, Vulcan was assigned to the Fleet Train
         which was made up of service vessels providing coal and
         supplies to the Allied naval forces. In January 1919, Vulcan
         was next assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service
         for six months of duty. Placed out of commission in July 1921,
         Vulcan was sold to N. Block and Company of Norfolk, a scrap
         metal firm, in December 1923.</p>
         <p>The USS Vulcan (AR-5) was the third U.S. Navy vessel to
         bear the name of the Roman god of fire, metalworking, and
         craftsmanship. Vulcan was launched on December 14, 1940 just
         about a year after keel was laid down in mid-December 1939 by
         the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden, New Jersey.
         Mrs. James Forrestal, wife of the Undersecretary of the Navy,
         was the ship's sponsor.</p>
         <p>Six months later, on June 16, 1941 USS Vulcan was
         commissioned with Lieutenant Commander P. G. Hale, USN, listed
         as the ship's first commanding officer. Captain R. W.
         Mathewson, the guest speaker for the commissioning ceremony
         designated the new repair ship and her crew to be the
         "craftsman, forger, and healer of wounded floating warriors of
         the Navy."</p>
         <p>After her shakedown cruise, Vulcan served as repair ship in
         Hvalfjordur, Iceland, arriving there in September 1941. At
         this time, British and American destroyers were screening
         merchant convoys, representing a vital sea link between North
         America and war-ravaged Europe. Weeks before Pearl Harbor and
         our entry into World War II, American destroyers were attacked
         by German U- boats while on patrol. On October 17, the USS
         Kearny (DD-432) was torpedoed, suffering thirty-three
         casualties. Returning to the American anchorage under her own
         power, Kearny was positioned alongside Vulcan for repairs. Two
         weeks later, on October 31, the USS Reuben James (DD-245) was
         sunk by a Nazi marauder. Eventually, some of the wounded from
         both of the destroyers were cared for in Vulcan's sickbay.</p>
         <p>By Christmas 1941, the Kearny was ready to return to the
         United States for further work. In recognition of the fine job
         performed by Vulcan's crew, Admiral E. J. King sent a letter
         saying, "the successful accomplishment of this feat of repairs
         merits the sincere appreciation of all, and is an inspiration
         to those in the Naval service ashore who are building and
         repairing units of the fleet."</p>
         <p>Vulcan remained in Iceland until April 1942. She left on
         the 26th and one of her escorts was the Kearny. Arriving in
         Boston on May 2, Kearny blinked a grateful message to Vulcan:
         "Thanks for all you did." Vulcan's brief dry dock period was
         interrupted in late May. The destroyer-tender USS Prairie
         (AD-15), then berthed in Argentia, Newfoundland, had suffered
         extensive damage when a fire from an alongside ship spread to
         the tender. As a result, Vulcan was called upon to relieve the
         Prairie. Vulcan served as repair ship in Argentina until
         November 14. Commissioned in August 1940, the Prairie was
         based in San Diego and was the only active ship in the Navy
         older than Vulcan, until its decommissioning in March
         1993.</p>
         <p>In mid-November, Vulcan returned to Hvaljordur and relieved
         the USS Melville (AD-2), from her repair assignment. On April
         6, 1943 Vulcan left Iceland for Hampton Roads, but set a
         course via Londonderry, Northern Ireland, because of the
         German submarine danger.</p>
         <p>Following an outfitting period in Norfolk, Vulcan arrived
         in French Algeria on June 27, 1943. First based in the capital
         city of Algiers, Vulcan supported the Sicilian invasion as
         head of Task Force 87 Train, a collection of twelve auxiliary
         vessels. On August 4, a Vulcan rescue and assistance team came
         to the aid of HMS Arrow, a British ammunition ship that had
         caught fire in the harbor. Three Vulcan sailors received Navy
         and Marine Corps Medals for their heroic efforts. During one
         German air raid on the port, Vulcan gunners were credited with
         downing a Junker-88 divebomber.</p>
         <p>In October 1943, Vulcan sailed west for Oran and berthed in
         nearby Mers-el-Kebir, the principal French naval facility.
         While there, Vulcan supported the Sardinian, Corsican, Anzio,
         and southern France invasions. As Admiral H. D. Hewitt's
         flagship (Commander, North African Waters), Vulcan hosted
         Generals Eisenhower, Patton, Bradley, and Clark.</p>
         <p>Vulcan left Algeria in November 1944. After repairs and
         outfitting, Vulcan departed Norfolk in mid-January of 1945.
         Arriving off Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, on February 9,
         Vulcan later shifted to the Florida Island and Tulagi Island
         area (fifteen miles north of Guadalcanal) for repair duty.
         After a brief stay in Noumea, New Caledonia, Vulcan
         transferred to Ulithi Atoll, Service Squadron TEN's famous
         "Overhaul Center of the Pacific." While at Ulithi, Vulcan
         workers were dispatched to anchored ships in need of
         maintenance and received the USS Biloxi (CL-80) and USS
         Hinsdale (APA-120) alongside to repair damage suffered from
         kamikaze attacks.</p>
         <p>In May 1945, Vulcan moved to Leyte Gulf, Philippines, where
         she received the USS Randolph (CV-15), USS New Mexico (BB-40),
         USS Block Island (CVE-16), and USS Rocky Mount (AFC-3) for
         alongside repairs.</p>
         <p>Following Japan's-surrender, Vulcan steamed to Buckner Bay,
         Okinawa. She not only offered her wide array of repair
         services, but also on September 28, led seventeen merchant
         ships from the harbor to avoid damage from an approaching
         typhoon.</p>
         <p>Vulcan served on occupation duty in Japan from October 1945
         until March 1946. After spending a few days in Pearl Harbor,
         Vulcan transited the Panama Canal and returned to the United
         States.</p>
         <p>Newport, Rhode Island served as Vulcan's homeport for about
         eight years until the tender was transferred to Norfolk in
         February 1954. While in Newport, Vulcan's crew was actively
         involved with the civilian community and the ship's athletic
         teams were always among the city's best.</p>
         <p>In late 1962, Vulcan participated in the Cuban Quarantine
         operation by providing repair services to the ships manning
         the naval blockade (November 3-29).</p>
         <p>In October 1963, on her way home following the completion
         of a training cruise, Vulcan rescued a 41-ft. yawl named
         "Northern Light," carrying three crewmen. Standing by the
         stricken craft through the night, Vulcan towed the yawl to
         Little Creek the next morning.</p>
         <p>Vulcan again performed rescue duties in March 1964 when she
         came to the aid of the USS Antares (AKS-33) and helped
         extinguish an uncontrolled fire that was raging in the supply
         ship's No. 3 hold. In late 1964, Vulcan participated in the
         NATO exercise "Teamwork" and then proceeded to take part in
         "Steel Spike I," the largest amphibious exercise since the end
         of World War II.</p>
         <p>In May 1965, Vulcan served as flagship for a mobile
         logistic support group and provided repair support to units of
         the fleet engaged in the Dominican Republic intervention.
         President Johnson eventually ordered 30,000 U.S. troops to
         maintain order in the Caribbean nation.</p>
         <p>Among the many ships Vulcan serviced in 1967 was the USS
         Liberty (AGTR-5), which was later accidentally attacked by
         Israeli planes and gunboats during the Arab-Israeli conflict.
         Although Vulcan remained in Norfolk during the Vietnam years,
         many vessels repaired by her were transferred for duty with
         the Pacific Fleet.</p>
         <p>In late 1975, Vulcan paid a working visit to Cartagena,
         Colombia, where she tended three ex-U.S. Navy destroyers of
         that nation's navy. Not only did Vulcan repair the vessels,
         but her crew also provided valuable training to their
         Colombian counterparts.</p>
         <p>A comprehensive overhaul lasting nine months was completed
         in 1976. Gone were the ship's four five-inch guns. In 1977,
         while returning from underway training, Vulcan was called upon
         to assist a Portuguese destroyer named Coutinho. Alongside,
         Vulcan provided emergency boiler feedwater to the
         Coutinho.</p>
         <p>By a matter of hours, Vulcan became the first non-hospital
         ship in the Navy to receive women officers on November 1,
         1978. The first contingents of enlisted women in arrived in
         December 1978 and January 1979. Vulcan's first point-to-point
         cruise with women took place in February 1979, with a trip to
         Earle, New Jersey. In September 1979, Vulcan left Norfolk for
         the Navy's first Mediterranean cruise with a mixed crew. A
         pioneer in the Women in Navy Ships (WINS) program, female
         sailors made up one-seventh of the crew.</p>
         <p>In September 1980, Vulcan deployed to the North Atlantic to
         participate in the NATO exercise "Teamwork 80" which included
         ships from the United States, United Kingdom, the Netherlands,
         and West Germany. Vulcan completed an extensive overhaul of
         thirteen months in mid-February 1983. Captain J. E.
         McConville, the ship's thirty-fourth commanding officer,
         guided Vulcan to a successful completion of the difficult
         overhaul and subsequent refresher training. In May 1983, while
         en route to Florida from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Vulcan assisted
         a Haitian refugee boat, the "Rose Carida," adrift without
         power for three days.</p>
         <p>Port visits to St. John's New Brunswick and Earle, N.J.,
         were made in the first half of 1984. On October 1, Vulcan left
         for Diego Garcia, where she was scheduled to relieve the USS
         Yosemite, another World War II- era vessel. Vulcan resumed her
         Norfolk duties in mid-1985.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The bulk of the collection consists of material gathered by
         Michael A. Southwood, while a crewmember of USS Vulcan,
         1982-1983. In October 1982, at the request of Commander Donald
         J. Farber (executive officer), and Captain J. E. McConville
         (commanding officer), Petty Officer Southwood began writing a
         history of USS Vulcan, one of only a few World War II-era
         vessels still in commission at this time. A completed
         manuscript was given to Captain McConville in early 1984, and
         a copy may be found in Series II, Box 2, Folder 5. Prior to
         his transfer in mid-1984, Captain McConville suggested the
         establishment of a USS Vulcan archival collection, with the
         purpose of preserving and making accessible, the historical
         record of one of the Navy's most noted ships. Captain
         McConville felt that nearby Old Dominion University would be
         appropriate for a site since Norfolk has served as Vulcan's
         homeport for over three decades. Even with the Vulcan out to
         sea, Captain McConville recognized that men and women who had
         traveled many miles to see their old ship would not be
         disappointed, because the collection would only be a brief
         drive from the Naval Base.</p>
