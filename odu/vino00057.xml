         <p>On April 17, 1945, eight black and eleven white women met
         in the vestry room of Ohef Sholom Temple in Norfolk. Mrs. W.T.
         Mason had invited these women in order to consider forming an
         interracial committee. All the women present were active in
         civic organizations, and came from different religious
         backgrounds.</p>
         <p>At that first meeting it was decided that such an
         interracial group could indeed be beneficial to Norfolk.
         Furthermore, they decided that their organization should be
         autonomous - not affiliated with any other organization, but
         working in cooperation with them.</p>
         <p>Mrs. Mason was appointed temporary chairman and the group
         held meetings in May, June, and September. The first two
         meetings were devoted to establishing a constitution and
         coming up with a name. By December, there were 86 members.</p>
         <p>Early in 1946, the WCIC was becoming active in the public
         school system, and worked with the public libraries and the
         Boy Scouts to notify the public of their humanitarian goals.
         These goals were:</p>
         <p>.... to improve city facilities for education, recreation,
         employment, and health</p>
         <p>.... to improve interracial attitudes</p>
         <p>.... to seek equality of opportunity for everyone</p>
         <p>.... to work towards full citizenship privileges for
         all</p>
         <p>The WCIC implemented these goals by calling attention to
         the need for more blacks in civic occupations; worked with
         health organizations in providing testing for diseases and
         public health information; held public meetings and other
         activities with nationally known speakers to advance the ideas
         of integration; and met with city officials concerning proper
         housing for the poor. For the first two years the group met in
         different churches and kept their files and printed materials
         in the homes of its officers and chairmen. Finally the WCIC
         was able to get space for an office and meetings at the YWCA.
         This lasted for several years.</p>
         <p>As stress in Norfolk over the desegregation of public
         schools reached a climax, the WCIC found itself pitted against
         many opponents of desegregation. It became more difficult to
         find meeting places open to such a group. Also, when they did
         find a place, they often could not advertise their meeting
         because of criticism and possible censure it would draw
         towards those who allowed such a meeting to take place at
         their establishment. Consequently, for a period of time, the
         WCIC worked more "behind the scenes" than in the public eye.
         However the effectiveness of the group endured and through
         their studies and reports of other cities with integrated
         school systems, the group helped Norfolk overcome the crisis
         in 1958 when the public high schools were shut down.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The Women's Council for Interracial Cooperation (WCIC) was
         an organization of white and black women devoted to fostering
         racial harmony. The papers, dated 1959 to 1961, include the
         organization's constitution, minutes of meetings,
         correspondence, speeches, annual reports, member lists,
         booklets, pamphlets, programs, invitations, newspaper
         clippings and published articles. Of interest is a transcribed
         panel report titled, "How Norfolk Opened Her Schools," dated
         February 2, 1959 and Susan Slaughter's personal account of the
         "First Fifteen Years of WCIC." In addition, there is material
         relating to the inception and early history of the Human
         Relations Council, which superseded the WCIC.</p>
