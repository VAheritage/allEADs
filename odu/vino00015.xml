         <p>Margaret E. White was born in Norfolk, Virginia on February
         22, 1908. She graduated from Hollins College in 1930 with a
         Bachelor of Arts Degree. After graduation, Miss White was
         employed by the Norfolk School System, teaching history at
         Blair Junior High from 1930 to 1934. After leaving that
         position for the commercial world for a couple of years, Miss
         White resumed her position at Blair Junior High School from
         1936 to 1945.</p>
         <p>From 1945 through 1946, Miss White became Program Director
         of the American Red Cross in South Korea, where she supervised
         the recreational activities for the United States Army. In
         1947, she returned to a career in education at Alice Deal
         Junior High School in Washington, D.C., teaching science and
         math. After only one year in Washington, Miss White returned
         to Norfolk in 1948. She again was employed by the Norfolk
         School System, teaching history at Granby High School from
         1948-1965. It was during this period that Miss White became
         involved in the struggle to reopen the public schools of
         Norfolk, during the integration crisis of 1958-1960.</p>
         <p>Miss White's efforts to reopen the schools in Norfolk, were
         recorded on a CBS television documentary, "The Lost Class of
         '59." There is substantial evidence in her papers of the
         support of many people throughout the nation in her valiant
         struggle to maintain educational standards for all students of
         all races.</p>
         <p>In 1965, Miss White became Director of Public Relations for
         "Operation Headstart" while working for the Southeast
         Tidewater Opportunity Program. This was a federally funded
         program to assist in the education and employment of the poor
         minorities of the United States. In 1971, she worked for the
         Goodwill Industries. During 1976, Miss White worked with the
         Bicentennial Committee.</p>
         <p>Margaret White retired to a home for
         Senior Citizens in Richmond, Virginia. Miss White's philosophy
         in regard to public education and her humanitarian activities
         can be summarized by her own comments: "World history must not
         be neglected: without a world view how can we comprehend the
         nationalism of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa? Everywhere
         the oppressed people are rising up and making their
         declarations of independence. Students need to be taught a
         respect for the accomplishments of other races, cultures and
         civilizations before the United States can truly lead the
         world -- a world which has no hope unless it finds peace among
         dissimilarities. There are values besides facts that concern
         teachers who deserve the title: the value of respect for law
         and order, the respect for the dignity of mankind, the
         appreciation of individual differences and the realization
         that hate reaps evil. No, it is not riches, nor is it prestige
         which makes us teach. It is the conviction that in men there
         is a potential which can, through education, tolerance, and
         understanding, build a better world. The hope of this teacher
         is that a strong voice of moderation will speak out to open
         our public schools, so we may -- each in his own way,
         TEACH."</p>
