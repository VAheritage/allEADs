         <p>John Paul Carter was born May 14, 1923 in Clarksburg, West
         Virginia. He was the oldest child of the Rev. Josiah Tidbal
         Carter and Virginia Rutherford Nolting. He had two younger
         brothers, James and Josiah, and two sisters, Virginia and
         Louise. John was always known as "Jack", probably because his
         grandfather and uncle shared his name. Carter married in 1947.
         He and his wife, Joan, had six children together.</p>
         <p>In his youth, Jack attended public schools in Clarksburg.
         He decided long before college that he wanted to be part of
         the ministry. He was accepted to both Harvard and William and
         Mary. Because of the financial assistance it offered, he chose
         to attend William and Mary. In college, Carter was involved
         many extracurricular activities. He was President of the class
         of 1945, member and officer of the biology club, and choir
         member in the Bruton Parish Church. He was active in the
         Canterbury Club. He also started a football team. Carter
         graduated in June 2, 1944. After graduation, he went to the
         Virginia Theological Seminary.</p>
         <p>In 1947, Carter was ordained in his father's church in
         Durham, North Carolina. He went on to become deacon-in-charge
         of St. James Kannapolis, St. Paul's, and St. Peter's
         Salisbury. Five years later, Carter accepted a job as the
         Episcopal Chaplain to the University of Texas. There he put
         his energy into church reform.</p>
         <p>In 1964, Carter accepted a job with the Airlie Foundation
         in Warrenton, Virginia. The Airlie Foundation was a "think
         tank" organization. Airlie served as an innkeeper for a number
         of National and Washington organizations, and they generated
         meetings between people with similar liberal/populist ideas.
         There Carter met Henry Berne and Max Tuffs. They were all very
         active in opposition to Massive Resistance and in Community
         Action. Among other things, they "preached" and spoke
         politically at Black churches, wrote position papers, and
         campaigned for Henry Howell and for George Rowling. After a
         year, Carter left Airlee. He went back to working for the
         Episcopal Church. There he served as Secretary/Treasurer of
         the National Association of Episcopal Schools.</p>
         <p>In 1979, Carter received his Ph.D. After graduation, he
         became assistant to the President of Mary Baldwin College. He
         resigned this position after six weeks. Carter then moved to
         Maryland, and served at St. John's in Ellicoll City.
         Eventually, he became a rector there.</p>
         <p>Retiring in 1987, Carter moved to Sewanee, Tennessee. In
         1997, Carter died of pulmonary fibrosis.</p>
