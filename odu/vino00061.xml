      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Dr. A. Rufus Tonelson was born in New York City on November
         17, 1911, After his family moved to Norfolk, he attended that
         city's public schools through graduation from Maury High
         School in 1929. After completing his undergraduate work in
         1933 and after two years in the Army during World War II, he
         married Sara Gladys Hamburg and they had two children - Louis,
         who was born on May 1, 1947 and Stephen Willis, who was born
         on April 3, 1950.</p>
      <p>Dr. Tonelson began his college education as one of the
         first students of the newly formed Norfolk Division of William
         and Mary in 1930. During his three years as a Norfolk Division
         student, he was quite active in school athletics, particularly
         as a varsity baseball and basketball player, and literary
         activities, especially as a reporter for the campus paper-The
         High Hat. In addition, he also taught various lab science
         courses during his senior year when he was employed as a
         student lab instructor. After three years of attending classes
         at both the Norfolk and Williamsburg campuses, he received a
         Bachelor of Science Degree from William and Mary in 1933.</p>
      <p>Shortly after his graduation, Dr. Tonelson continued to
         teach biology and lab sciences at the Norfolk campus as he had
         done in his senior year. Then, in 1936, he left the Norfolk
         Division to teach general science at Ruffner Junior High
         School. After three years at Ruffner, he transferred to Maury
         High School where he taught biology, history, and government
         in addition to coaching varsity basketball.</p>
      <p>After serving in the United States Army from 1943 to 1945,
         Dr. Tonelson returned to Norfolk where he was employed as the
         Director of Veterans training for that city. A few years
         later, he left that position and re-entered a teaching career,
         which was eventually to involve him in a very difficult
         challenge. After teaching for a short while at a local
         elementary school, he was in 1950, appointed Assistant
         Principal and Varsity Basketball Coach at Maury High School.
         For a number of years, he also served as the Principal of the
         Maury High Night School. During this period, and mostly
         because of his graduate work in education, Dr. Tonelson was
         named a visiting Associate Professor of education at the
         Williamsburg campus of William and Mary. In 1953, Dr. Tonelson
         received a Masters in education from that same school. His
         Master's thesis was entitled "A Study of a High School
         Guidance Program."</p>
      <p>In 1957, Dr. Tonelson was appointed principal of Maury High
         School. Even though he held that position for almost a decade,
         his most significant contribution came during massive
         resistance when Maury, along with a number of other schools,
         was closed by opponents of integration. Viewing such closings
         as an unfortunate neglect of the needs and potentials of
         students, Dr. Tonelson worked diligently to have the schools
         re- open as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>During his career as Principal of Maury High School, Dr.
         Tonelson continued his Academic study. In 1963, he received a
         doctorate in Administration and Supervision from Michigan
         State University upon completion of his dissertation entitled
         "A Study of the Principalship in Larger High Schools in the
         Southern Association of Colleges and Schools."</p>
      <p>In 1966, Dr. Tonelson joined the faculty of Old Dominion
         College first as a Lecturer and then, in the same year, as a
         full Professor and Chairman of the Secondary Education
         Department, In September 1969, he was named Dean of the Darden
         School of Education of Old Dominion University. After two
         years in that capacity, he was, in 1971, named by President
         Bugg as the Assistant to the President for School and
         Community Relations. Then, in 1973, he was named to serve as
         the Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity
         Officer for Old Dominion University. Subsequently, after a
         long and meritorious career, Dr. Tonelson retired on July 1,
         1976.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The majority of this collection consists of papers
         representing teaching aids and materials collected by Dr.
         Tonelson during his four decades of teaching at Old Dominion
         University, formerly Old Dominion College and the Norfolk
         Division of William and Mary. While some of the material
         reflects his initial teaching experience at the Norfolk
         Division of William and Mary, most of the papers in this
         collection are from the later phases of his teaching
         experience at Old Dominion College and University's School of
         Education.</p>
