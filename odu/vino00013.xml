      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>Stanley Clay Walker was born July 2, 1923, in Norfolk, Virginia.  He attended public schools in Norfolk and graduated from Fork Union Military Academy and the Norfolk Business College.  When World War II began he enlisted in the United States Army and served in the European Theater, as part of an ordnance unit of the 82nd Airborne Division.</p>
      <p>Following his discharge from service, Walker returned to Norfolk and became a partner in a steel fabricating and engineering firm. He married Sybil Bruce Moore, and had two daughters: Susan Gray Walker Meslang, who is one of the founders of the CHANCE educational program for disabled adults at Old Dominion University and Elizabeth Tray Walker, who is currently an attorney and government relations lobbyist for based in Alexandria, Virginia . Mrs. Walker served on the Board of Visitors, Old Dominion University, from March 30, 1990 to June 30, 1994. Walker served as President of Stanley Walker Associates, Inc. Walker was resided in Norfolk, until his death in 2001.</p>
      <p> Walker, a Democrat, began his career in public service as a member of the Norfolk City School Board in 1959. This was shortly after the public schools reopened following the "Massive Resistance" program, which tried to thwart desegregation. Throughout his political career, Walker was a strong advocate for education on all levels. For his support of Old Dominion University throughout the years, when the school was transitioning from a college to a university, the Board of Visitors at the college awarded Walker as a resolution of appreciation, on September 17, 1992.  The technology building at the Norfolk Campus of Tidewater Community College is named after him.</p>
      <p> As one who wanted to reform the Democratic Party, he became active in a group known as "The Young Turks."  Walker was elected to a seat in the House of Delegates in 1964 as a Representative of the consolidated 5th, 6th, and 7th districts of Norfolk. He took the oath of office on January 8, 1964, and served four terms there to 1971.  In 1971, the Federal Court combined the senatorial districts into one multimember district and Walker took the oath of office as Senator on January 12, 1972.  He served from that date until January 2000, representing parts of Norfolk and parts of Virginia Beach in the Sixth Senatorial District (Walker lost his bid for reelection in 1999).  One aspect of Walker's distinguished career was his service on the Virginia State Crime Commission. He became its first chairman in 1966 and served in that position to 1979. He was also a strong advocate for the protection of children, in which he was chairman for the Commission on Early Childhood and Child Day Care Programs. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The Walker Papers consist of 35 linear shelf feet in 80 document cases. They deal primarily with his legislative duties as a member of the House of Delegates, 1964-1971 and his service as a member of the Senate from 1972 to 1977, serving parts of Norfolk and parts of Virginia Beach in the Sixth Senatorial District. The papers consist of personal and legislative correspondence, legislative papers and files, speeches, copies of bills introduced, news releases, statistical data, clippings, maps, a poster, and studies.</p>
      <p>The first series in the collection is Correspondence (19 cases), which a substantial portion deals with legislative matters. The bulk of the collection can be found within in Series II: Legislative Papers (22 cases), pertaining to Walker's work within in the General Assembly, in which he dealt with issues such as education, bills and legislation, special sessions, transportation, Equal Rights Amendment, the establishment of the Eastern Virginia Medical School, as well as taxes and budgets. Series III: Legislative Files (10 cases), consists of loose books and binders of compiled materials that Walker kept in regard to issues within the General Assembly and his Senate campaigns. Series IV: Virginia State Crime Commission (13 cases), also makes up a significant part of the collection, in regard to Walker's work within the commission, which consists of statistics and data, conferences, prison visits, pari-mutuel betting and gambling, as well as information regarding sex crimes, juvenile crime, drug and alcohol abuse.  Within Series V (5 cases), there are political files in regard to Walker's campaigns, as well as speeches he made for these campaigns, which are found in Series VI (2 cases).</p>
      <p> Walker was very meticulous in collecting articles and clippings on issues within the state of Virginia, as well as personal interest. These clippings can be found in Series VI: Clippings (2 case) and VIII: Scrapbooks (4 cases).  The scrap-books had to be scanned and copied, due to their fragile condition. There is also one case of miscellaneous materials (Series IX: Miscellaneous) which rounds out the collection.</p>
