      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Hiram F. Glazier lived in or near, Trenton (Dade County)
         Georgia just prior to the Civil War, but the exact date and
         place of his birth are not available. His father was Marnoch
         Glazier, his mother is not identified in the collection, and
         his family included three other brothers, Van Glazier, L.
         Glazier, and X.R. Warren (half brother perhaps), and one or
         two sisters, Amy Glazier and Ana Marie Glazier. Other known
         relatives included an uncle, Charles Warren, and two cousins,
         J.G. Warren and G.W. Butler. In turn, Hiram Glazier married
         Rebecca Wilson (March 12, 1836-December 8, 1896) and they had
         three children, Lucy Glazier (September 22, 1856), Marshall
         Glazier (October 24, 1858), and Belle Glazier (February 24,
         1861). Other possible relatives or friends mentioned in this
         collection include C.H. Chadwick, T.H. Chadwick, Amanda
         Chadwick, Charles M. Glazier, Mr. Morrison, Franklin Daniel,
         George Statton, Mrs. M. Kithead (?), Blevins Auston, Mr.
         Carrel, Hardy Tare, Alexandria Smith, Emerson Blevins, William
         Buckner and Sis, D.L.G. Wilson, and Mandy.</p>
      <p>Mr. Glazier enlisted on July 16, 1861 as a private in
         Captain G.W. Cureton's company D of the 39th Georgia Regiment.
         Organized as part of a statewide effort to send a large number
         of men into battle as quickly as possible, the 39th Georgia
         volunteers had the following officers: Colonel J.T. McConnell,
         Lt. Colonel J.F.B. Jackson, Major J.H. Randall, and Adjutant
         W.M. McCallister. The captains of the various companies were:
         (A) L.W. Crook, (B) T.H. Pitner, (C) Timothy Ford (D) J.W.
         Cureton, (E) C.D. Hill (later replaced by Henry P. Osborne),
         (F) James H. Anderson, (G) B.J. Brown, (H) William H. Edwards,
         (I) John D. Hayes, (J) J.W. Brady. During the course of the
         war, this regiment was assigned to the army of Tennessee and
         saw the following action: the campaign of 1862 in East
         Tennessee and Kentucky; the battles of the Vicksburg Campaign
         in Mississippi being among those captured and then later
         exchanged at Vicksburg; the battle of Missionary Ridge; and
         the Atlanta and Tennessee campaigns in the spring of 1865. It
         was consolidated with parts of the Thirty-Fourth and
         Fifty-Sixth regiments and fought in the campaign of the
         Carolinas where it surrendered along with J.E. Johnston. Its
         Colonel, J.T. McConnell, died November 25th, 1864 after being
         shot in the Battle of Chattanooga and was replaced by Lt. Col.
         Jackson. In addition, two company commanders died during the
         course of the war, Captain Brady who was killed in action and
         Captain Osborne who died at home from an illness contracted
         earlier.</p>
      <p>Hiram Glazier saw extensive action in the war even though
         he was active for approximately a year. After duty in Big
         Shanty Cobb County, Georgia and Knoxville and Chattanooga, and
         perhaps because of several forced marches and an inadequate
         diet, he became ill and was sent to a hospital outside of
         Atlanta where he died on May 2, 1862. He was buried in a
         Confederate cemetery outside that same city.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers consist of correspondence including ones Glazier
         wrote and ones which friends or relatives wrote to him or his
         family. The papers range in dates from 1861 to 1863. Also,
         included within them are copies of some interesting and
         important items including "The Southern Banner" which could be
         called the Confederate national poem and the response sent to
         Glazier's widow by T. Calvert of the Confederate Treasury
         Department. The most important aspect of these papers is the
         extensive insight that they provide about the attitudes of
         Confederate soldiers and their families. All of the documents
         in this collection are copies of the originals.</p>
