         <p>William Polk Fitchett was an Eastern Shore plantation owner
         who resided in the community of Seaview in Northampton County,
         Virginia. He lived in the Poplar Grove plantation home that
         was built in 1783 by Benjamin Stratton. As a farmer his income
         was created by the growing of potatoes, which were transported
         north by rail and corn, which was used to feed his livestock.
         He had a common country school education and was of English
         descent.</p>
         <p>William Polk Fitchett was married to the former Margaret E.
         Mapp, his first wife, who was originally from Willow Grove
         plantation in Weirwood, Virginia. By his first wife, Fitchett
         had two children, a daughter Willetta and a son, James P.
         Fitchett. It is from this first marriage that the Doughty
         family traces it genealogical roots to the present. The dates
         of birth, death and marriage to his first wife are unknown.
         Fitchett's daughter Willetta was born June 19, 1862. She
         married Edward Joseph Doughty (born May 10, 1861 - died
         January 19, 1954). The marriage produced two children: E. J.
         Doughty, Jr. (born March 6, 1895 - d. ?) and Adelaide W.
         Doughty (born January 24, 1894). Adelaid married Louis M.
         Doughty. They had two sons, Louis C. Doughty (May 14, 1922)
         and Francis Marion Doughty (November 5, 1925). Mrs. Adelaide Doughty outlived her husband and resided on the Eastern Shore. She passed away on March 9, 1993.</p>
         <p>William P. Fitchett lived through but did not participate
         in the Civil War and was married a second time to the former
         Elizabeth Ann Roberts (b.? d.?). They had three children, two
         sons Julian (b.? d.?) and Charles Polk Fitchett (b.? d.?), and
         one daughter, Eva Roberts Fitchett (b.? d.?). Little is known
         about the second set of William Polk Fitchett's children.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The Doughty Family Papers, dating from 1855 to 1904, are a
         collection of letters, paid receipts and household ledgers
         belonging to William Polk Fitchett. The content of many of the
         letters deals with James Polk Fitchett's (William's son) life
         at the school and also love letters sent to Willetta Fitchett
         (William's daughter) from various suitors. The paid receipts
         consist of charges for services rendered to or from Fitchett
         himself and the ledgers are an account of household expenses
         from the years 1887-1890. Other items in the 57-piece
         collection are brochures, a shopping list, a poem and business
         letters from distant relatives and friends.</p>
