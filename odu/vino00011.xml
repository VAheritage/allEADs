         <p>Hugh Lee Butler, son of Le Grande Cornelius Butler and
         Martha Watkins Simpson Butler (d. 1897), was born July 19,
         1871 in Farmville, Prince Edward County, Virginia. He had
         three brothers: Percy H., Hunter C. (d. 1905), and Stanley W.
         (d. 1923). Butler's parents moved to Norfolk when he was nine
         years old. He attended public schools in Farmville and
         Norfolk.</p>
         <p>Butler married Effie Lee Grace, at the residence of W. E.
         Brown. The ceremony was performed by the Rev. J. T. Whitley.
         They became the parents of one daughter, Alice, and three
         sons, Hugh Lee Jr., Willard H., and Robert T., all of whom
         survived him. His wife died on December 17, 1935.</p>
         <p>Butler began as an office boy at the Seaboard Air Line
         Railway on May 12, 1884. Promotion followed promotion over the
         years. In 1922, he was promoted to the position of contracting
         freight agent, a position he held until his retirement. On
         March 19, 1937, he received a congratulatory letter from L. R.
         Powell and Col. Henry W. Anderson upon completion of 50 years'
         service to the Seaboard. G. B. Rice presented him a 50- year
         service medal on behalf of the company. He retired at age 70,
         the Seaboard being the only company for which he had ever
         worked.</p>
         <p>Butler's political career was a distinguished one. It began
         on what was known as the Common Council, July 1, 1902,
         representing Brambleton. His term as a member of the Norfolk
         City Council expired August 31, 1938, after 36 years of
         service.</p>
         <p>He began his career as a member of the Charter Commission
         in 1902 and served on that body and the Select Council until
         the council-city manager form of government became a reality.
         Then he served as a member of the new government for 20 years.
         He also served on such committees as: Finance, Fire, Public
         Improvement and Annexation. He served many times as a member
         of the Democratic Committee from Brambleton and as chair of
         the Local Draft Board No. 1 from April 1, 1917 - March 31,
         1919. He became especially involved in responding to citizens
         whose need for municipal services had not been met and civil
         servants (teachers, municipal workers) whose salaries had been
         cut during the Depression. Members of the Afro-American
         community found him to be a champion for their causes. One
         evidence of his tie to that community was a note from P. B.
         Young, publisher of the Afro-American Journal and Guide when
         Butler's wife died. He also worked on such projects as the
         introduction of parking meters to Norfolk and a study of
         school needs, both salaries as well as space.</p>
         <p>Butler was known as a person of personal integrity, one who
         was loyal in his support of the city's welfare and one who had
         a mastery of the city's business. These traits provide a
         partial explanation as to the length of his political career.
         His service of 36 years was the longest in Norfolk's modern
         history. An appraisal of his life was best expressed in a
         resolution passed by the City Council on February 5, 1946:
         "That in the death of Hugh L. Butler, the citizens of Norfolk
         have lost a faithful and conscientious public servant, whose
         interest in their welfare and efforts in their behalf will
         long be remembered, and the City has lost a valued citizen of
         outstanding integrity and fidelity."</p>
         <p>Though he retired from public office in 1938, he continued
         as a public servant. His appointment by President Franklin
         Delano Roosevelt on October 12, 1940, as Secretary to Norfolk
         City Draft Board No. 4 is just one instance of his
         service.</p>
         <p>He was in demand as a speaker before such organizations as
         the Ballantine Civic Association and the Ocean View Democratic
         and Social Club. He was made an honorary member of the Norfolk
         Athletic Club.</p>
         <p>He died at his home on January 28, 1946 following two heart
         attacks the previous week.</p>
