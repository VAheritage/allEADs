         <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
         <p>Ideas for a Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences were
         originated in 1900 by the Leache-Wood alumnae who formed the
         Irene Leache Art Association in 1915 and the Norfolk Society
         of Arts in 1917. The site for the museum was reserved by the
         city in 1917. The museum was chartered in 1924. In 1932 and
         1939, the museum was actually built. One wing was built first,
         and the other later.</p>
         <p>In May of 1952, the Tidewater Natural History Council
         formed. It developed rapidly as part of the museum, and
         sponsored lecture and exhibit programs. The program worked
         well with the existing Tidewater history collection in the
         museum, and sought to become a permanent exhibit complete with
         specimens indigenous to the Tidewater area. In 1953, a public
         gallery containing shadow boxes and dioramas of local wildlife
         and wildlife habitats was installed in the museum. In
         particular, the exhibits highlighted life on the local
         seashores and in the Dismal Swamp.</p>
         <p>By the end of 1954, a group of annual contributors known as
         the "Natural History Associates" was formed to help fund the
         museum's Natural History Division. With funding, the Natural
         History Council began to produce a Natural History newsletter,
         and informative booklets for schools and clubs.</p>
         <p>The Natural History Division of the museum was active
         throughout the end of the 1950's and throughout the 1960's. It
         had both live and stuffed animal displays, and held classes
         and field trips on archaeology, botany, and ecology. In 1970,
         the future looked promising for the division, as the Natural
         Sciences Section was reestablished as a permanent part of the
         museum's organization.</p>
         <p>In 1971, the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences became the
         Chrysler Museum of Art when art collector, Walter P. Chrysler,
         Jr., presented the museum with his collection. The Natural
         Sciences and History functions of the museum were phased out
         around this time, as part of the museum's reorganization.</p>
