         <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
         <p>Peter Kostas Babalas, son of Kostas Babalas and Katherine
         B., was born July 8, 1922, in Boston, MA and grew up in
         Cambridge, MA. He attended a vocational high school and went
         on to receive an A.B. degree in economics from Harvard College
         in 1945. His college work was interrupted by service in the
         armed forces of the United States during World War II.</p>
         <p>In 1948 he married Lillie Macheras of Lexington. They
         became the parents of two daughters, Marcia A. and Karen E. He
         received an L.L.B. degree from the University of Virginia Law
         School in 1950 and began the practice of law in Norfolk, VA.
         In 1951, he opened the law firm of Peter K. Babalas &amp;
         Assoc., PC. In the late 1960's, he left the firm to start a
         general private practice with his wife as his para-legal.</p>
         <p>Babalas' record of military service began in 1942. On
         September 8, 1942, he enlisted as an Aviation Cadet in the V-5
         Program, US Naval Reserve, and served until March 5, 1943. Two
         weeks later he enlisted as a Private in the Army and was sent
         to the Anti-aircraft Military School, Camp Davis, NC, and
         served until January 26, 1944, during which period he became a
         First Lieutenant. The next day, January 27, 1944, he began
         service in the 423rd Infantry and was discharged on June 7,
         1946. Recalled during the Korean Conflict, he served in the
         army from February 1951 to May 12, 1952. From that date he
         remained as a First Lieutenant in the US Army Reserve until
         April 1, 1953, when he was honorably discharged. His various
         commands included the European Theater of Operations where he
         received the ETO Medal with 4 Battle Stars.</p>
         <p>Babalas became a Virginia State Senator representing the
         5th District Norfolk in 1967. He served the consolidated 5th,
         6th, and 7th Senatorial Districts of Norfolk City and Virginia
         Beach City from 1968 until his death in 1987. He rose through
         the ranks of the state Democratic Party to become chairman of
         the powerful Senate Rules Committee. He was also a senior
         member of the Senate Finance Committee and thus a participant
         in the budget-writing process. His papers indicate that he
         also chaired the following committees: VALC Committee on
         Virginia Port Authority, Joint Subcommittee on Banking, and
         VALC Industrial Development and Revenue Bond Study. He is
         remembered in particular for his work in unifying the Hampton
         Roads ports and championing the causes of his constituents. He
         was also known throughout his political career, as well as in
         his personal fife, as a scrapper.</p>
         <p>When Babalas returned to the General Assembly at its
         session on January 9, 1986, he was accused by the Senate
         Ethics Advisory Panel "of violating two sections of the
         conflict-of-interest law last year by casting votes that
         benefited one of his clients, Landbank Equity Corp." (quoting
         Atty. Gen. William G. Broaddus, Virginia-Pilot, January 9,
         1986). In that same month he became the first member of the
         Virginia General Assembly to be censured by his colleagues for
         unethical conduct. After several months of study and
         deliberation, a news item appeared on August 15, 1986, stating
         that "State Senator Peter K. Babalas of Norfolk was acquitted
         the preceding Thursday [August 14, 1986], on charges that he
         violated the Virginia conflict-of-interest act, even though
         Circuit Judge Thomas N. Vance said Babalas had a personal
         interest at stake when he helped defeat a bill last year"
         (Virginian-Pilot).</p>
         <p>In addition to being a member of the Virginia State Senate,
         Babalas was also a member of numerous other organizations:
         Greek Orthodox Church, Saints and Sinners, Masonic Lodges to
         Shrine (Khedive), Elks, Civitan, Knights of Pythias, American
         Legion, Virginia Trial Lawyers Association, American Bar
         Association, Virginia Bar Association, and Norfolk-Portsmouth
         Bar Association.</p>
         <p>He died on December 29, 1987, in Virginia Beach, VA, after
         a near decade-long battle with myeloma.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The Babalas Papers spans the years 1943-1979, and deal
         primarily with his legislative duties as a Virginia State
         Senator. The legislative files include speeches, copies of
         bills introduced, correspondence, news releases, news
         clippings, and studies that chiefly relate to banking
         legislation, Industrial Development and Revenue Bond Act,
         Pari-Mutuel Betting, and studies concerning the port of
         Hampton Roads. Other materials include the platform released
         during his campaign for the State Senate in 1965, and his
         military discharge papers.</p>
