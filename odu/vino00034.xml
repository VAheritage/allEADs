      <p>Thom Williamson was born on August 5, 1833, at Edenton,
         North Carolina. His father was William Price Williamson, Chief
         Engineer, United States Navy and later Engineer-in-Chief of
         the Confederate States Navy. His mother was the former
         Penelope Benbury McDonald.</p>
      <p>Thom Williamson spent his boyhood in Norfolk, Baltimore and
         Philadelphia. He received his principal education in Norfolk
         at the Norfolk Military Academy. In 1847 his father was
         ordered to Baltimore, Maryland to which the family moved. He
         attended St. Mary's College in Baltimore from 1847 to 1850.
         His father was transferred in 1850 to Philadelphia where Thom
         went and stayed about one year. In Philadelphia the young man
         went to work at the Vulcan Iron Works which was outfitting the
         U.S.S. Susquehanna with machinery built for her under the
         superintendence of William Price Williamson in Baltimore. The
         family returned to Norfolk in 1851. Thom was placed in charge
         of a small farm not far from the city--"Sycamore Cottage." A.
         Mehaffy employed young Williamson as an-assistant draftsman,
         working on drawings of machinery for the United States
         steamers Powhatan and Allegheny.</p>
      <p>Williamson entered the United States Navy as Third
         Assistant Engineer in 1853. Thom Williamson was an engineer in
         the United States Navy from 1853 until he was relieved from
         active duty with the rank of Rear Admiral in 1912. His first
         ship was the U.S.S. Saranac where he was a shipmate of his
         father Chief Engineer William Price Williamson.</p>
      <p>The Saranac made a cruise in the Mediterranean Sea, which
         lasted almost three years. Thom Williamson was promoted to
         second assistant engineer in 1855. In July 1857, he was
         ordered to the Wabash, which he joined at the Isthmus of
         Panama. He landed at Greytown (San Juan del Norte) with the
         naval force which captured "General" Walker, the
         filibusterer.</p>
      <p>Promotions continued to follow one another rapidly. In 1858
         Williamson became first assistant engineer and in 1861 he was
         promoted to Chief Engineer. He married Julia Price on December
         2. 1861. She was the daughter of William Ferdinand Price, who
         was employed in the office of the Secretary of the United
         States Senate. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War, Williamson
         faced a serious dilemma. Thom's father, William P. Williamson
         resigned from the United States Navy and accepted an
         appointment as Engineer in the Navy of the Confederate States
         of America. The elder Williamson became Engineer-in-Chief and
         took a prominent part in the construction of the Confederate
         ironclads, e.g., the Merrimac or Virginia. The rest of the
         Williamson family also supported the Confederacy. Thom
         however, renewed his oath of allegiance to the United States
         of America and declined a commission, filled out and signed by
         Jefferson Davis, appointing him a Chief Engineer in the Navy
         of the Confederate States of America. This action cut Thom
         Williamson off from his family and friends, but he was
         reconciled to them after the war.</p>
      <p>During the Civil War, Williamson served on the U.S.S.
         Hartford, the flagship of Rear Admiral Farragut. He was
         present at the Battle of Mobile Bay in which the Union forces
         captured or sunk several vessels, including the Confederate
         ram Tennessee. Chief Engineer Williamson made frequent
         inspections of the Engineer Division on the Hartford during
         the battle. He was also involved in the capture of Forts
         Gaines and Morgan on August 8 and 23. He and three other
         officers were ordered by Admiral Farragut on the day after the
         battle of Mobile Bay to make a "strict and careful survey" of
         the Confederate ram Tennessee captured on August 5.</p>
      <p>After several other tours of duty Williamson was ordered in
         April 1874 to the U.S.S. Lancaster as Fleet Engineer of the
         South Atlantic Station. He was placed in charge of Engineers'
         Stores at the Portsmouth, New Hampshire Navy Yard on April 28,
         1876. In 1879 he was ordered to report on board the U.S.S.
         Powhatan as Fleet Engineer of the North Atlantic Station. He
         was ordered to the Navy Yard at Norfolk, Virginia on September
         19, 1881. Upon completion of his tour of duty, he was again
         ordered to the U.S.S. Hartford in November 1884 for duty as
         Fleet Engineer of the Pacific Station.</p>
      <p>From 1887 to 1895 Williamson served in Washington, D.C. He
         was ordered to the Navy Department in July but his orders were
         changed to special duty as Superintendent of the State, War
         and Navy Departments Building. He remained at this position
         until his retirement from active service on August 5, 1895. In
         1889 he had attained the relative rank of Captain and on his
         retirement he was awarded the relative rank--but not the
         grade--of Commodore. He was recalled to active duty in 1898 at
         the time of the war with Spain as a member of a board, which
         was examining plans for coaling ships at sea. He continued to
         reside in Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>The latter years of Thom Williamson's career was quite
         varied in activities. He was awarded a diploma and bronze
         medal for collaboration in the Paris Exposition. He installed
         and was in charge of the Naval Exhibit at the Pan-American
         Exposition held in Buffalo in 1901. In December 1901 he
         resumed active service at the Navy Department. He was assigned
         to Charleston South Carolina for special duty with the Naval
         Exhibit for the Exposition to be held there. He installed the
         Naval Exhibit and then returned to duty in Washington. He was
         relieved from active duty on June 6, 1912. In 1906 he was
         advanced on the retired list to Chief Engineer with the rank
         of Rear Admiral.</p>
      <p>Thom Williamson had seven children: Julia Price; Virginia
         McDonald; Lizzie Bell; Marie Howell; Anne Walke; Thom and
         William Price. He died on March 17, 1918.</p>
