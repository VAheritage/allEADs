         <p>The Johnson family is one of the oldest families in New
         England. The progenitor of this branch of the Johnson family
         was James Johnson, who was one of eighty men who came to this
         country with Sir Fernando Gorges in 1621. This group settled
         on the Isle of Shoals, later to be known as the town of Rye,
         New Hampshire. His daughter, Mary Johnson, married John
         Ordiorne, who settled on what is now known as Ordiorne's Point
         in the town of Newcastle, New Hampshire. A few generations
         later, Daniel Johnson married Jane Ordiorne furthering the tie
         between the Johnson and Ordiorne families. Jotham Ordiorne,
         son of John and Mary Ordiorne, was the first judge of the
         Superior Court in the Province of New Hampshire.</p>
         <p>The Johnson family had a part in every war on the
         continent, with the exception of the war with Mexico, a war
         that was waged to obtain more slave territory, and which was
         not popular in New England. Philip Johnson was with Sir
         William Pepperel at the capture of Louisburg, C.B. in 1690.
         Lewis Johnson was with DeWolf at the capture of Quebec from
         the French. Daniel Johnson was a soldier in the Revolutionary
         war. Another Johnson was a member of General Ulmer's Regiment
         in the war of 1812. The brothers, John and Ralph Johnson
         served in the Civil War. Ralph was killed at the battle of the
         Wilderness. John served as an officer in the Navy, and was
         promoted twice for his gallant conduct in action.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The collection consists of mostly personal correspondence
         between the members of the Johnson and Allen families of
         Maine, who were related by marriage. The letters date from
         1838 to 1947. In addition to the correspondence other items
         included in the collection are photographs of an ice storm,
         postcard, genealogical information, receipts and accounts.
         Aside from its insight into the lives of members of the
         Johnson and Allen families, this collection has some
         information that may be of interest to someone researching the
         genealogy of the Johnson and Allen families, as well as the
         Tracy's of Maine who are also related.</p>

            <p>The collection is organized into three series: I.
            Personal Correspondence; II Business Papers; III
            Miscellaneous.</p>
            <p>Series I: Personal Correspondence. This series contains
            personal correspondence among the Johnson, Allen, and Tracy
            families between 1838 and 1947.</p>
            <p>Series II: Business Papers. This series includes
            receipts made out to Franklin Johnson in the 1870s and to
            Henry Tracy in the 1930s. The receipts are for printing,
            coal, and taxes. Also included are account statements for
            John A. Johnson for 1859.</p>
            <p>Series III: Miscellaneous. This series includes
            photographs, cards, newspaper clippings (mainly obituaries
            and historical articles), and a list of births in the
            Johnson family from 1788 to 1849. Also included are a Knox
            County Consumer's Sugar Card (for rationing during the war)
            and "The Maniacs: Kora Temple Shrine Song."</p>
