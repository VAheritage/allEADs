         <p>Vivian Carter Mason was born February 10, 1900. Her father
         was a Methodist minister and her mother a music teacher. She
         grew up in a mostly white neighborhood in Auburn, New York,
         where she experienced discrimination first hand. She was also
         greatly effected by the stories her father told of her
         grandmother's life as a slave.</p>
         <p>Carter Mason credits her parents with encouraging her and
         her siblings to work hard in school and insisting that they go
         on to college. She succeeded in school and graduated from the
         University of Chicago in 1925. After college she was a social
         worker in New York where she worked her way up to the position
         of Director of Social Services from 1940-1942.</p>
         <p>After a being injured in a train wreck in 1942 she went to
         Norfolk, her husband's home town, to recuperate. During this
         time she began thinking about ways to reconcile the
         differences between the races. She began by calling women that
         she knew or were recommended to her, both black and white, who
         were concerned about racial injustice. These concerned women
         formed the Women's Council on Interracial Cooperation in 1945.
         This was the first group in the area to hold integrated public
         meetings. Mason served as the Council's first president from
         1945-47.</p>
         <p>Mason was involved in many other civil rights
         organizations. In 1953 she was elected the third president of
         the National Council of Negro Women. During her tenure as
         president she helped the organization devise strategies to
         work toward implementation of the Brown vs. Board of Education
         supreme court decision. In Norfolk, when schools were closed
         during the massive resistance she helped educate the "Norfolk
         17" by administering the school opened for them in the First
         Baptist Church.</p>
         <p>She became the first black woman to serve on the Norfolk
         city school board in 1971. She served on the school board
         until 1978 when she resigned to start the Urban League of
         Hampton Roads.</p>
         <p>Vivian Carter Mason died on May 10, 1982 in Norfolk. She is
         survived by her son William T. Mason, an attorney in
         Norfolk.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>

         transcripts of four interviews recorded between March and
         October of 1978. Each interview of Vivian Carter Mason was
         conducted by Zelda Silverman. The interviews mainly cover the
