      <p>Waiter and novelist Robert Deane Pharr was born July 05,
         1916 in Richmond, VA to John Benjamin (minister) and Lucie
         Deane Pharr (schoolteacher). He was raised in New Haven, CT
         and returned south to attend school. He was graduated from
         Virginia Union University (B.A., 1939) and did graduate work
         at Fisk, Columbia and New York Universities. He pursued his
         interest in writing at Virginia Union, where he was an editor
         on the school newspaper, and at Fisk. His race and medical
         history, a three year sanitorium stay for tuberculosis and a
         battle with alcoholism, limited his career opportunities and
         he became a waiter, working in exclusive resort hotels and
         private clubs.</p>
      <p>Pharr's first novel, The Book of Numbers, was published in
         1969 to critical praise. The story of an illegal lottery
         system in a southern town during the depression (reputedly
         based on Richmond's Jackson Ward), the book won favorable
         reviews for its realistic portrayal of Black Americans. The
         next three novels, S.R.O., The Welfare Bitch, and The Soul
         Murder Case, were less successful portrayals of crime and
         addiction in a Black urban setting. His fifth novel, Giveadamn
         Brown, relates the experiences of Lawrence "Giveadamn" Brown
         who moves from Florida to Harlem and takes over the empire of
         his kinsman, crime boss Harry Brown. The book is described as
         a thriller that follows Brown through his transition from naif
         to con man.</p>
      <p>Robert Deane Pharr died during surgery for an aneurysm on
         April 01, 1992 in Syracuse, NY.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>These papers consist chiefly of a draft and galleys for the
         book Giveadamn Brown. The draft is Pharr's original typescript
         and the galleys are printed by the publisher, Doubleday. The
         correspondence and clippings consist of a letter enclosed with
         the draft sent to Virginia Union and two clippings from
         Richmond newspapers regarding the novel.</p>

          <p>The correspondence consists of a letter dated June
               05, 1978, from Pharr to Verdelle V. Bradley, Virginia
               Union Librarian, that he enclosed with the original
               draft and which states "from time to time I will be
               sending you more papers". The two 1978 clippings are
               from Richmond newspapers; one lists Giveadamn Brown as
               one of the year's top fiction choices, and the other
               profiles Pharr's return to Richmond for a Giveadamn
               Brown book signing.</p>

          <p>The approximately 700 page draft is annotated with
               Pharr's changes and comments and includes quite a bit of
               unpublished material. The draft is folded as it was
               found, and seems to be slightly out of chapter order.
               The proof and galleys are also annotated, though
               considerably less so.</p>
