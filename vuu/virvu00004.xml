         <p>The National Theological Institute in Washington, D.C.
         established a campus in Richmond, Virginia in 1867 under the
         auspices of the American Baptist Home Mission Society (ABHMS).
         Headed by Dr. Nathaniel Colver, the school leased the former
         slave pen known as Lumpkins' Jail, located in the Shockoe
         section of Richmond. In September of 1868, the Reverend
         Charles H. Corey took over the school and in January of the
         following year, the school was renamed the Colver Institute.
         In January 1870, the Colver Institute moved to the United
         States Hotel on the corner of Main and 19th Streets (known as
         the Union Hotel until 1853) with financial help from the
         Freedman's Bureau. On 10 February 1876 the school was
         incorporated by the Virginia general assembly as the Richmond
         Institute. The last name change came in 1886 when the school
         was renamed the Richmond Theological Seminary. It remained
         such until it merged with Wayland Seminary (located in
         Washington, D.C.) in 1899 and became Virginia Union University
         at its present site at the corner of Brook Road and Lombardy
         Street.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>Most of the school's early records have not survived. This
         is most likely a result of storage problems such as fires and
         floods on campus. Others were possibly removed by departing
         administrators and faculty who viewed them as personal
         documents. The records described here constitute the extant
         records of the school from its founding in 1867 until its
         merger in 1899.</p>

               <p>These files comprise the bulk of the collection. The
               correspondence consists mainly of letters, both personal
               and business?related, written to Charles H. Corey. There
               are many letters regarding students, especially letters
               of commendation from employers and churches. Corey's
               book, A history of the Richmond Theological Seminary,
               with reminiscences of thirty years' work among the
               colored people of the South, was written as a
               fundraising tool in the New England area. Many letters
               are in response to his pleas, offering both financial
               and material assistance. There are also fascinating
               letters from a missionary in Africa by the name of
               Cosby. He describes the conditions in Lagos and West
               Africa, wars over slaves, and the natives' distrust of
               missionaries.</p>
               <p>The correspondence from the ABHMS, written by Henry
               L. Morehouse, Malcolm MacVicar, and Thomas J. Morgan,
               progresses from Society business to the development of
               Richmond Theological Seminary into a university. The
               lengthy letters of the late 1890's detail the ABHMS's
               struggle to purchase land for the new university and
               raise money for faculty.</p>
               <p>Also notable are the letters from Corey's
               contemporaries in higher education for African
               Americans. He corresponded with the presidents of
               Atlanta Baptist College, Hampton Institute, Shaw
               University, Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute,
               Virginia Seminary, and Wayland Seminary, to name a
               few.</p>

               <p>These records consist mainly of endowment fund
               subscriptions for the Richmond Institute. The ABHMS
               printed out pledges for a donation in five equal
               payments over five years to which the donor signed his
               or her name. There are also a few salary receipts signed
               by the school's professors.</p>

               <p>These two speeches, seemingly kept by Corey, are not
               directly related to the Richmond Theological Seminary.
               The first, 
               <title render="doublequote">Objections to the Doctrine
               of a particular Providence,</title>is signed "C.H.
               Corey, Newton, 07 October 1859." The second, 
               <title render="doublequote">Remarks by Dr.
               Bishop,</title>is neither signed nor dated (ca. 1880)
               and is written on paper embossed "Fairview." It
               addresses Bible?based education for African Americans
               instead of a classic or scientific education.</p>

               educational conference, and summary annual reports of
               ABHMS schools. Also in this file are "Regulations of the
               Richmond Theological Seminary," a list of the school's
               14 rules, and a student's admission application.</p>

               <p>The two volumes found herein are records of the
               Richmond Institute. The first page of the Registrar's
               Book states 
               <title render="doublequote">Information concerning
               Students of Richmond Institute Also Signatures of
               Students to the Rules and Regulations of the Institution
               1877.</title>On page one begins a section, entitled 
               <title render="doublequote">Record of Students</title>,
               where information on new students, including where they
               were born and baptized, is recorded in a brief paragraph
               by the registrar and then signed by the student. On page
               31 begins a 13?page section where information on former
               students is recorded. On page 201 begins a section in
               which students signed their promise to uphold and abide
               by the rules and regulations of the school. There are
               signature lists for classes from 1877 to 1898. The
               volume entitled 
               <title render="doublequote">Orations</title>appears to
               be final essays, on topics for the most part secular,
               handwritten by the students.</p>
