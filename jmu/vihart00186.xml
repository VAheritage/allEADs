      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Jay Garland Rainey (b. 1946) entered Madison College in September 1966 as a member of the
        college’s first fully coeducational class; he was originally from Alexandria, Virginia. He
        married Katherine (Tina) Marie Russell soon after graduating high school and they moved to
        Rockingham County with their son so Rainey could attend Madison. In an effort to prepare for
        his wife’s delivery of the couple’s second child and to save for tuition, Rainey left the
        college after two years of study and returned to Alexandria. Rainey was initially denied
        readmission for the 1968-1969 session due to his alleged unkempt appearance. He brought suit
        against the college in February 1969 and the ruling was subsequently overturned due to a
        lack of due process. Rainey returned to Madison for the 1969-1970 session.</p>
      <p>While attending Madison College, Rainey was active in several “radical” or “left-leaning”
        student organizations. Rainey served as the first editor of <emph render="italic">The
          Fixer</emph>, a student-run underground newspaper at Madison College from 1969 to 1973. It
        was published by the Madison College Free Press and its prime directive was to encourage a
        “meaningful exchange of ideas, a confrontation of minds.” Furthermore, the paper strove to
        reopen various channels of dialogue between students, faculty, and the administration due to
        a perceived lack of communication and overall transparency. Rainey was also active in the
        student group, Harambee. While Rainey described the organization as a “liberal group of
        like-minded people that would mainly get together and give each other support,” Harambee did
        not explicitly identify as a political organization.</p>
      <p>Rainey organized a sit-in at Wilson Hall in April 1970 after the administration announced
        that three professors – Roger Adkins, Assistant Professor of Economics; Houston Rogers,
        Instructor of English; and James McClung, Assistant Professor of English – would not have
        their contracts renewed for 1970-1971 academic term. Many students perceived the
        non-reappointments as being politically motivated rather than a result of poor academic
        performance. Rainey was arrested, convicted of trespassing, and, despite a long series of
        appeals, sentenced to a six-month jail sentence and a $500 fine. Governor Mills E. Godwin
        Jr. eventually pardoned Rainey and commuted his sentence on November 17, 1977. Rainey
        graduated Madison College in June 1971 with a B. S from the School of Social Sciences.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Jay G. Rainey Papers, 1970-1996, bulk 1970-1977, consist of five legal folders (.1
        cubic feet). The collection is comprised of materials relating to Rainey’s role in the April
        1970 protest of three faculty members’ whose contracts were not renewed. Additional
        materials are related to <emph render="italic">The Fixer</emph>, a student-run newspaper of
        which Rainey was an editor, and political brochures and newsletters from the AFL-CIO.</p>
      <p>The collection includes newspaper clippings, court documents, and correspondence
        documenting the April 1970 demonstration organized by Jay Rainey in protest of three faculty
        members’ non-reappointment for the 1970-1971 session. Of particular interest are letters
        written to Governor Mills E. Godwin Jr. by Staunton journalist William H. Reid and Rainey’s
        lawyer John C. Lowe requesting that Rainey and his co-defendants’, James McClung and Stephen
        B. Rochelle, be pardoned. Rainey’s November 17, 1977 signed pardon by Governor Godwin is
        included. A chronology of events related to the April 1970 protest, copied from Teresa
        Geary’s exhibit, is included.</p>
      <p>Materials related to <emph render="italic">The Fixer</emph> include editorial staff
        questionnaires, signed anti-Vietnam petitions, flyers, and a Report of Faculty Grievance
        Committee on the case of Dr. Edward D. Lipton, Associate Professor of Health and Physical
        Education, who was dismissed from the college and subsequently rehired. This report was
        printed in its entirety in the April 30, 1972 issue of <emph render="italic">The
          Fixer</emph>.</p>
      <p>Additional materials include a grouping of approximately 20 pamphlets, brochures, and
        newsletters published by the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education and the Virginia State
        AFL-CIO. Most relate to the 1972 presidential election.</p>
