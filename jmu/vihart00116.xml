<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>With a modest beginning in the early 1980s of approximately twelve inital members, Common Ground stemmed from Harrisonburg's Choose Life Peace Center, an ecumenical group concerned with nuclear proliferation and the U.S. intervention in Central America.  Common Ground:  Network for Peace, Justice, and the Environment, was officially founded in June 1987 by a group of representatives from local peace, justice, and environmental organizations.  As a networking organization to channel the efforts of local groups, associations, and churches through education, research and civic action, Common Ground's primary goals were education, study and research on peace, justice and environmental quality; networking; building strong personal bonds of mutual support; active participation for change; and celebrating spiritual and ethical commitments. By 1996, the network had grown to fifty-three affilliate organizations. Xaverian Brother Pete Mahoney was the network's long term director serving from 1987-1997. Brother Pete was followed by Ms. Dale Diaz in 1997 and Mr. Greg Czyszczon in 2003. 
</p>
<p>Common Ground promoted its core values by recognizing community members and projects at an annual awards banquet. Recipients over the years have included: Blacks Run Restoration; Allies,an organization for advocacy on behalf of the local gay, lesbian, and bi-sexual community; Ron Copeland, for organizing the Little Grill Soup Kitchen; Joe Giarriatano, an inmate who formed the Peace Center at Augusta Correction Center in Craigsville, Va.; the Community Mediation Center; and John Eckman for the Valley Conservation Center among many others. 
</p>
<p>The spirit of Common Ground embodied both "nonpartisan radicalism" and liberal theology with its preferential option for the poor and the marginalized members of society. Common Ground's activities and publications celebrated and gave voice to affiliate members and interests outside Harrisonburg's mainstream media outlets. The results of its alternative voice were political in nature: early members credit their activism for General Dynamics' withdrawal of a proposal to build a munitions plant in the Shenandoah Valley; Common Ground worked with the Peidmont Environmental Council to successfully oppose Walt Disney Inc.'s proposed "Historic America Theme Park" in Haymarket, Virigina; and former Harrisonburg Mayor Carolyn Frank credits Common Ground members with changing "politics as usual" in the community by rallying with the "Taxpayers Against Golf Spending" campaign which placed new faces on Harrisonburg's city council.
</p>
<p>Common Ground's newsletter was known by three different names while in publication-<title render="italic">Network for Peace and Justice</title> (December 1983 - May 1987), <title render="italic">Common Weal</title> (August 1987, November 1987), and <title render="italic">Common Ground</title> (March 1988 - December 1996).  All three titles are present within this collection.  Early newsletters were mimeographed or photocopied. By 1992 the newsletters were published on newsprint. In its heyday in the late 1990s, circulation reached 2,000 copies. A quarter of these copies were paid subscriptions, while the rest were freely distributed at local restaurants, campuses, and churches.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Common Ground Collection, 1984-2003, is comprised of two Hollinger boxes (.8 linear feet) primarily of administrative files and newsletters published or distributed by the now defunct Harrisonburg peace and justice organization, Common Ground.  The collection is arranged in six series:  Newsletters, Legal Documents, Administration, Publicity, Newsclippings, and Images.
</p>
<p>Series I, Newsletters, 1984-1996, consists of the organization's monthy publications on topics relevant to peace, justice, and environmental issues including recycling, government intervention in Central America, homelessness in Harrisonburg, and immigration, as well as a calendar with upcoming events and announcements.  There are minimal gaps in the dates depending on the regularity of published newsletters and missing newsletters.
</p>
<p>Series II, Legal Documents, 1987-1989, includes Articles of Incorporation and IRS forms.
</p>
<p>Series III, Administration, 1986-1997, consists of correspondence to Common Ground and resource material for the newsletter on such topics as: recycling, nuclear disarmament, tax resistance, draft counseling, conscientious objection, the Green Party, Harrisonburg International Festival, sustainability, transportaion, the Ted &amp; Lee performing group, community organizing, death penalty, immigration, Harrisonburg Police Department, Civil Rights, Harrisonburg Free Clinic, equal rights, school reform, Disney Historical America theme park, and social justice. Mailing lists, meeting agendas, and minutes of the board are also included here. 
</p>
<p>Series IV, Publicity, 1990-1997 and undated, contains fliers, brochures, and programs from the Common Ground speaker series, fundraising events, and community events in the spirit of Common Ground. Readings, performances, and activist opportunities may be found in this series.
