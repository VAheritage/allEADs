        <p>The collection as a whole required only limited preservation treatment. Some of the
          correspondence and papers did require Mylar sleeves. The 3D objects are housed together in
          one box with special housings created to protect them long-term. Most of the
          nineteenth-century letters required flattening to make them more accessible and to allow
          for proper digitization as per the donor agreement. Also, many of the diplomas and older
          photographs were removed from their frames for proper storage. Original order of materials
          was maintained wherever possible, taking into account provenance, storage needs, and
          accessibility for researchers.</p>

      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Blackley Family Papers document the related Scott, Bassett, Blackley, Hoge, and Nix
        families of mostly Texas and Staunton, Virginia between 1830 and 2016. James Scott
        (1799-1856) was a Tennessee native and former Mississippi Supreme Court chief justice who
        married Sarah Lane (1803-1880) and settled in Anderson, Texas. James was a prominent Texas
        judge who was friends with Davie Crockett. While in Mississippi and Texas, James and Sarah
        had six children. The eldest, Elizabeth "Lizzie" (1833-1917), was born in Mississippi in
        1833, Sarah "Sallie" (1843-1914), born April 9, 1843 in Texas, and one of their brothers,
        Garrett (1838-1862), born in 1838, contribute the most to this collection of letters.</p>
      <p>Lizzie married William H. Neblett (1826-1871), a farmer and attorney, in 1852. He
        eventually left her to go fight for the Confederacy. Her domestic struggle on the home front
        during the Civil War is the subject of Erika L. Murr's book, A Rebel Wife in Texas: The
        Diary and Letters of Elizabeth Scott Neblett, 1852-1864 (2001).</p>
      <p>In 1862, Sallie married Robert Houston "R.H." Bassett (1836-1870). R.H. went on to enlist
        and serve in the famed Hood's Texas Brigade from 1861 to his wounding in 1864. He worked
        briefly as the adjutant general to Major General John Bell. While leading the regiment, he
        was wounded at the Battle of Chickamauga by an artillery shell fragment that lodged in his
        shoulder. This would effectively end his role in the war. Following the conclusion of the
        conflict and his recovery from the wound, R.H. tried his hand at politics in a bid to
        represent Grimes County, Texas in Congress. Their first child, Robert, died tragically in
        1864 at only eight months old. R.H. died in 1870 because of health complications that appear
        related to edema.</p>
      <p>R.H.'s brother, Noah (1839-1886), also served in the Texas Brigade. The correspondence
        between R.H., Sallie, and Noah provides a lucid account of the Army of Northern Virginia's
        major campaigns and operations, including developments related to the Battles of Antietam,
        Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga.</p>
      <p>Garrett Scott, Sallie Scott's brother, died in action at the Battle of Antietam September
        17, 1862 while serving in the Texas Brigade. His letters from the early years of the war
        offer yet another perspective of campaign and camp life.</p>
      <p>R.H. and Sallie's daughter, Barbara "Belle" Bassett (1865-1958), married William Mason
        Blackley (1863-1898) in 1884 and lived in Staunton, Virginia before moving to Washington,
        D.C. Research suggests they only had one child, Belle Blackley (1890-1967), whom never
        married and lived out her life in Washington, D.C. However, an 1888 letter contained in this
        collection written by Ida Carter, the Blackley's "Black Mamy," is addressed to a Col.
        Bassett Blackley, in care of W. M. Blackley. Carter begins the letter "Dear Little Bassett."
        This letter seems to suggest that the Blackleys did in fact have another child, Bassett
        Blackley, prior to Belle. If that is the case, Bassett Blackley may have died in
        childhood.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the twentieth-century material concerns William's nephew, Charles "Chas"
        Blackley Sr. (1909-1999), his wife Catherine Matthews Blackley (1914-2010), and their son
        and daughter-in-law Charles "Chuck" Phillips (b. 1951) and Patricia Fry Blackley (b.
        1952).</p>
      <p>Charles "Chas" Phillips Blackley Sr. was born in Staunton, Virginia in 1909. His parents
        died from the Spanish Flu when he was 10. Their deaths required Chas and his sister Mary
        Gilkeson Blackley to move in with their aunt, Fannie Blackley Cushing in Staunton. These
        materials cover his travels throughout the Pacific and Asia aboard a "tramp steamer" with
        boyhood friend, George Earman in 1930, his 1927-1929 military training in the little
        discussed Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC), time at the Virginia Military Institute
        (VMI), his 1934 travels in Europe, World War II military service, and ownership and
        operation of WSVA, the first radio station in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Chas sold his share in
        WSVA and moved to Staunton, Virginia where he started the WTON radio station. Beyond his
        official jobs, Chas spent much of the early 1930s as an amateur playwright and author. Chas
        and Catherine Matthews were married in 1938.</p>
      <p>While traveling Europe via train in 1934, Chas met David Kahn, a young Presbyterian judge
        of Indian descent. They would become lifelong friends. Mr. Kahn went on to become a governor
        of an Indian province under British rule and later head the Department of Sanitation for
        Calcutta. He and his wife visited their children, who had moved to the United States, and
        Mr. and Mrs. Blackley often until his health would not allow it. Evidence of their lifelong
        friendship can be found most clearly in this collection's correspondence and
        photographs.</p>
      <p>Chas' WWII experience saw him drafted at age 35 and shipped to Camp Crowder, Missouri for
        training. He would eventually be transferred to Washington, D.C. where he worked as a
        private in the basement of the Pentagon. According this son, his superiors frequently called
        him upstairs to request autographed photos of American Broadcasting Company (ABC)
        celebrities. He was able to oblige them because of WSVA's status as an ABC affiliate.</p>
      <p>Catherine Matthews Blackley was originally from Cambridge, Maryland and came to the
        Shenandoah Valley to attend the State Teacher's College at Harrisonburg (now James Madison
        University). She graduated in 1935 with a degree in home economics. For a short time she
        taught in Norfolk, Virginia before marrying Chas Blackley in 1938 and buying a home on Port
        Republic Road in Harrisonburg. After Chas was drafted and shipped to Camp Crowder, Mrs.
        Blackley traveled to Neosho, Missouri to be with her husband. While in Missouri, she
        volunteered with the Red Cross to help care for wounded soldiers. She continued this service
        after Mr. Blackley was transferred to Washington, D.C. After the war, they returned to the
        Valley and Catherine became a member of the Staunton School Board and was very active in
        volunteer work.</p>
      <p>Charles "Chuck" Phillips Blackley Jr. was a professional engineer and graduate of Virginia
        Tech. He provided services in Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland. Chuck married Patricia
        Fry in 1971. At the time he sold his office it was the largest engineering company in the
        region outside of Richmond, Roanoke, and Northern Virginia.</p>
      <p>Patricia Fry Blackley graduated from James Madison University in 1987 and became a licensed
        real estate appraiser. After Chuck stepped away from his engineering office he teamed up
        with his wife and the couple became full-time photographers and writers. Their work can be
        found in hundreds of magazines, books, and calendars.</p>

          <head>Scope and Content</head>
          <p>Series 1: Correspondence, 1830-2011, is comprised of more than 300 individual letters
            with the majority of the earlier ones involve Sarah "Sallie" Scott Bassett and/or her
            husband R.H. Bassett. Together their combined correspondence comprise eight folders and
            spans the years 1850-1913.</p>
          <p>These letters cover the years of the American Civil War and shed light on how the
            conflict affected their lives. In addition to letters from Captain R.H. Bassett, there
            are dozens of notes written home to Sallie from her brother Garrett Scott,
            brother-in-law Noah Bassett, and her cousin John Nix. All of these men spent time
            serving in the 4th Texas Regiment of the famed Texas Brigade. While their letters
            contain minimal military focused discussions, they do highlight camp life, personal
            struggles of being separated from each other, personal and public incidents, and family
            news. The military discussion is really limited to mention of the dead and wounded from
            battles and engagements. However, R.H. does write a letter to Sallie as he arrives on
            the battlefield at Gettysburg. He expresses excitement to build off the Confederates
            successes that afternoon. Battles and engagements discussed include Antietam (September
            17, 1862), Chancellorsville (April 30 to May 6, 1863), Gettysburg (July 1-3, 1863), and
            Chickamauga (September 18–20, 1863).</p>
          <p>Lizzie Scott Neblett was the older sister of Sallie Bassett and many letters between
            the sisters not previously examined, both before and after the American Civil War, can
            be found within this collection. Their letters shed light on relationship struggles,
            farm life, local news, and family connections.</p>
          <p>While few in number, the surviving letters of Lizzie and Sallie's father, James Scott,
            provide significant insight into Texas prior to its in 1846. In the first, James writes
            his wife, Sarah, from the convention in Austin, Texas, where the debates about joining
            the United States were taking place. He offers few specifics as "Nothing in which you
            would take any interest has occurred here and therefore I will not say anything about
            the proceedings…" In second of these letters, James is writing to a Colonel B. Rush
            Wallace and gets far more political in discussion and tone. He talks at length about
            concern over the merits of becoming Whig or Democrat once they are thrust into the
            existing political climate of their new nation.</p>
          <p>Of particular interest is an 1888 letter written by Ida Carter, presumably William M.
            and Belle Bassett Blackley's "Black Mamy," is addressed to a Col. Bassett Blackley, in
            care of W. M. Blackley. Carter begins the letter "Dear Little Bassett." This letter
            seems to suggest that the Blackleys did in fact have another child, Bassett Blackley,
            prior to Belle. If that is the case, Bassett Blackley may have died in childhood.</p>
          <p>Of the twentieth-century correspondence, most of it was sent or received by Chas
            Blackley. While his letters span most of the century, the bulk are centered between the
            years 1930-1944. The letters that Chas Blackley wrote while visiting Europe in 1934 are
            of particular interest due to the changing political climate with the rise of the Nazis
            in Germany. Through his correspondence, diaries, and photographs there is an opportunity
            to see an American view of this transformative time. In one letter to his sister, Mary,
            dated August 21, Chas Blackley writes of the hanging of Nazis in Vienna, Austria for a
            failed coup that took place mere weeks before his arrival and that it "has retarded
            history making considerably." He also spoke of the <emph render="italic"
            >Heimwehr</emph>, the home guard, patrolling the streets with their rifles and "keeping
            a sharp to windward."</p>

          <head>Scope and Content</head>
          <p>Series 2: Personal Papers, 1857-2015, is comprised of personal papers, diaries, and
            other documents that highlight the careers and interests of the family members. R.H.
            Bassett's papers include Confederate government and military documents pertaining to
            promotions, recruitment, and resignation.</p>
          <p>Another unique piece of this collection from the early period is the Belle Bassett
            Diary, 1873-1879, which offers a glimpse of the post-war years for a child growing up in
            the South.</p>
          <p>Chas Blackley, in addition to his letters from the trip to Europe, also kept a diary of
            his experiences. This diary covers the personal and public incidents of his travels.</p>
          <p>More information about individual members of family is available here in the form of
            detailed histories of specific family lines (Blackley, Bassett, Hoge, etc.), through
            family trees, and biographical information.</p>
          <p>Other items of note from Chas Blackley are the many manuscripts of novels and plays
            that he wrote in the early-to-mid 1930s.</p>

          <head>Scope and Content</head>
          <p>Series 3: Ephemera, 1856-2004, houses many unique items such as hundreds of stamps
            (U.S., Confederate, and international), brochures, certificates, awards, diplomas, and
            pamphlets from events such as the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics and the 1933 World's Fair in
            Chicago, and dance cards. The aforementioned diplomas and certificates document the
            Blackley family's achievements and graduations from various schools and universities,
            including the University of Virginia, the State Teacher's College at Harrisonburg, and
            Virginia Tech. Many of the manuals and booklets used in Chas' various military training
            can be found in this series.</p>
          <p>There are also newspaper clippings that share stories directly related to family
            members or address significant events of the time. These include awards won by the
            family, news about new jobs or graduations, historic events like D-Day, and John F.
            Kennedy's assassination.</p>
          <p>One of the more locally relevant pieces is a pamphlet entitled "Dedication of the
            Shenandoah National Park" (1936). It lists the planned dedication speech from President
            Franklin D. Roosevelt given at Big Meadows as the key event.</p>
          <p>This series also includes one oversize box of 3D ephemeral objects. Objects of interest
            include a Kodak No. 2 Folding Autographic Brownie camera (1917-1926) owned by Chas
            Blackley and inscribed with the names of Blackley and the SS <emph render="italic"
              >Gertrude Kellogg</emph>, Dr. Charles Coatesworth Phillips' small leather medicine
            case with glass bottles that he took on house calls, several pairs of glasses, a glass
            plate photograph of Susie E. Phillips, and assorted World's Fair ephemera.</p>
          <p>Stored separately are multiple flags that are likely from Chas' 1930 voyage in the
            Pacific. There is a large and small Japanese flag, a small Chinese [pre-communist
            revolution] flag, and a small Philippine national flag. An additional flag dates to WWI
            and features the United States flag surrounded by smaller flags of all our allies from
            that conflict.</p>

          <p>Series 4, Photographs, ca. 1861-1989, includes a large number of pictures from both of
            Chas Blackley's trips to Asia and the Pacific in 1930 and his journey through Europe in
            1934. </p>
          <p>There are also a number of rare pictures of the Civilian Military Training Camp (CMTC)
            experience at Ft. Eustis, Virginia, from 1928, and to our knowledge might be the only
            ones publicly available. </p>
          <p>As Catherine Matthews Blackley was a graduate of the State Teacher's College at
            Harrisonburg (now JMU), there many pictures from her time on campus during the early
            1930s in this collection. </p>
          <p>Another rare item housed here is an ambrotype of an unidentified woman which is located
            in Miscellaneous, 1884-1993 (folder 3 of 4). The subject's identity is unknown, but the
            style of production dates the piece to around 1858. Given that date and the apparent age
            of the woman, it is plausible that the subject is Sarah Lane Scott, Sallie Scott
            Bassett's mother. </p>

          <head>Scope and Content</head>
          <p>Series 5: Scrapbooks, 1862-1931, is comprised of four scrapbooks. In the aftermath of
            his wounding and the conclusion of the American Civil War, R. H. Bassett found a calling
            to participate in local and state politics. The majority of the first scrapbook contains
            newspaper clippings of news relating to his exploits and proclamations. </p>
          <p>The CMTC and VMI scrapbook highlights Chas Blackley's time with both of these
            organizations and places. The CMTC material is rare as the military's official website
            for the history of Ft. Eustis fails to even mention the fort's role during in that
            capacity. </p>
          <p>Finally, there are two scrapbooks document the journey that Chas Blackley and childhood
            friend, George Earman, made upon the steamer SS <emph render="italic">Gertrude
              Kellogg</emph> in 1930. Both scrapbooks chronicle Blackley and Earman's travels
            through the Pacific and multiple Asian nations.</p>
