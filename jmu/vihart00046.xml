            <head>Provenance</head>
            <p>The collection of diaries was first presented to George M. Hanger by Smals' grandson,
               Gal Miller, in 1910. The diaries were then given to George P. Furry in 1920, Edwina
               Furry in 1970, and Dorothy Merriefield in 1983.</p>

            <head>Processing Notes</head>
            <p>The diaries appear to have been rebound, perhaps several times, and some volumes have
               sections in them that are not in chronological order. In some places the ink has
               faded to illegibility. In the fall of 2002 and 2003, Peggy Dillard and Ken Hinkle
               respectively created partial indices for the Smals diaries. The entries transcribed
               as part of these partial indices are included under each diary's scope and content
               note. </p>
            <p>In order to streamline the process of applying collection numbers, Special
               Collections staff completed a large-scale renumbering campaign in the spring of 2017.
                  <emph render="bold">This collection was previously cataloged as SC
               2059</emph>.</p>

         <head>Biographical Information</head>
         <p>Henry Smals (1810-1892) is listed in the 1850 Rockingham County Census as a shoemaker
            with real estate value of $1,000 with a wife, Mary, and six children. There is an entry
            for Henry Smalts in the 1860 census and for Henry Smalls in the 1870 census that gives
            additional household details. He may also have been a barber sometime during the 1880s
            (ses Box 3, Folder 4). His surname appears as a variation of Smalz and Smaltz as
            well.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Henry Smals Papers, 1871-1891, consist of three boxes containing eighteen volumes of
            diaries written by Henry Smals of Bridgewater, Virginia. The topics of diary entries are
            brief outlining day-to-day activities. There are mentions of acquaintances that are ill,
            various business transactions conducted in town, the movement of livestock, and hay
            through town, ongoing town projects, church activities, marriages, births, deaths, and
            other details of town life. The activities of "colored people" are occasionally noted.
            Throughout the diaries, Smals made small drawings of people and animals and added
            illustrations clipped from newspapers. A folder, located in Box 3, contains printed
            copies of a partial index and a list of highlights for most volumes as well as an ad for
            "Henry Smals, Fashionable Barber! Main Street, Bridgewater, Va."</p>
