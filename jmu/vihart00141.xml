      <head>Biographical Information </head>
      <p>Davis and Associates, AIA, was founded in 1955 in Harrisonburg, Virginia. At the time, the firm's founder, D'Earcy P. Davis Jr., was working for Nielsen Construction Company. Before Davis retired in 1985, the firm had grown to provide architectural services for over thirty counties and cities in Virginia and West Virginia. They also completed work for a number of educational institutions, including James Madison University, Bridgewater College, Eastern Mennonite University, and Blue Ridge Community College. Throughout the years, the firm completed work for a number of prominent members of the community, including Governor Mark O. Hatfield, Fred Funkhouser, and Irving Ney. Clyde E. McClintock took over the firm in 1985, and remained as its head until 2003, when he also retired. Both Davis and McClintlock were members emeritus of the American Institute of Architecture.</p>
      <p>D'Earcy Davis Jr. was born in 1917 and went on to earn a degree in structural engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1940. He moved to Harrisonburg with his wife Frances to work for Nielsen Construction and architect Clarence Wenger. D'Earcy took his architecture-licensing exam at the University of Virginia in 1943. He continued to work for Nielsen Construction until 1955, at which point he left to found Davis and Associates. He remained as the leader of that firm for thirty years until he retired in 1985. In retirement, Davis served as president of the Rockingham Development Corporation from 1988 until his death in 1990.</p>
      <p>Clyde McClintock was born in 1929 in Maidens, Virginia. He graduated from the University of Virginia's School of Architecture in 1951 and moved to Harrisonburg with his wife Eleanor to join Davis and Associates in 1961. After his retirement in 2003, he served on various community boards until his death in 2012.</p>
