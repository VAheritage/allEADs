            <p>This collection was previously known as the Carrier Library Collection, LI-93-0406. In 2015 this collection was merged and reprocessed with the Carrier Library Vertical File as well as the LET Publications Vertical File along with multiple accessions from 2012, 2014, and 2015. Items from LI-93-0406 were placed in Series 6: Library History. Materials in the accessions included five linear feet from the Office of the Dean in 2012 and five linear feet from the office of Sharon Gasser, Associate Dean of Carrier Library in 2014. In 2015, three accessions were added. These include architectural renderings of Rose Library, ca. 2008, government documents, and files from the office of Reba Leiding, a former librarian at Carrier Library and Jody Hess, a former library staff member. The most recent accession in 2016 came from the filing cabinet in the Special Collections Reading Room and from the files of the departing Special Collections Librarian, Lynn Eaton.</p>

Any duplicate items found within the collection itself have also been discarded. In addition, one acquisition in 2015 had a large amount of general institutional records, such as Self-Studies, or items unrelated to the Libraries and Educational Technologies Records. These materials have been transferred to appropriate collections within Special Collections. Large materials, such as floor plans, that were received folded up have been flatted. All media items in Box 34, Folder 4 of Series 6 are pending reprocessing. In April 2018, the Oversize Series was removed and integrated into appropriate series within the collection.</p>

         <p>James Madison University's first library was housed in Maury Hall and sat 40 students. In 1915, the library was moved to Harrison Hall, increasing its capacity to 98. Fifteen years later, a reading room was added to Harrison Hall, allowing it to seat 165 students and hold 20,000+ volumes. Despite these expansions, students called for a new building with more space and better lighting in October 1937. The following year, President Samuel Duke obtained funds from the Public Works Administration (PWA) and began construction on Madison Memorial Library. The library opened on September 22, 1939, seating 350 students and holding 80,000 volumes. Increased enrollment prompted additions in 1971, 1982, and 1994. Madison Memorial Library was renamed Carrier Library in 1984 after the fourth president of the university, Ronald Carrier. Today Carrier Library contains the humanities related collections. </p>
         <p>In August 2008, the University built a second library on East Campus. East Campus Library (ECL) doubled the staffing and services of the library. ECL was renamed Rose Library in 2012 after the fifth president of the university, Linwood H. Rose. Rose Library holds the science related collections. </p>
         <p>The University also has two subject specific libraries: the Music Library and the Educational Technology Media Center (ETMC). The Music Library is housed in the Music Building and provides scores, sound recordings, software titles, journals, and several special collections in support of the Music department. While not an official part of Libraries and Educational Technologies, the ETMC in Memorial Hall works with the College of Education to provide access, assistance, and maintenance to the library collection. The ETMC houses the juvenile collection, a small reference collection supported by the library materials budget, and the K-12 curriculum materials that support the College of Education. </p>
         <p>In addition, Special Collections, located on the second floor of Carrier Library, was established in 1983 to document the history of JMU and the Central Shenandoah Valley. Today, Special Collections continues its mission of documenting the history of JMU and the Central Shenandoah Valley while also serving as Carrier Library's repository for rare and valuable materials and supporting JMU curriculum and community research through primary source materials. </p>
         <p>The newest member of Library and Educational Technologies is Innovation Services, located in both Carrier and Rose Library. Innovation Services is focused on creative technologies, such as 3D Printing, video production, sound recording, and virtual reality, and making them available to the JMU community. </p>

         <p>The Libraries and Educational Technologies Records span from 1939 to 2016, with the bulk of the records from 1988 to 2009. The records detail the administrative functions of the library and document its position as an academic resource on the JMU campus. Records consist of financial records, committee reports, library policies, various subject files, and library history primarily from the Office of the Dean as well as the Associate Dean. The collection is arranged into six series.</p>

               <p>Arranged in two subseries: Annual Reports, 1975-2012 and Budgets, 1982-2010. Arranged chronologically within each series.</p>
               <p>Series 1: Financial Records, 1975-2012 is the largest series in the largest series within the collection. Most materials from this series are from 1980-2010, though some records are from as early as 1975.  Annual Reports are an evaluative tool required by any program subject to Academic Program Review.  These reports review the library's mission and goals, support the development of priorities, and contribution to strategic planning. The Annual Reports are from various departments within the library such as Periodicals, Serials, Technical Service Division, Educational Media Lab, and Collection Development, as well as a general summary report from JMU Libraries. The Budget subseries relates to collection management and acquisitions and contains many budgets for different areas of the library. Each budget is accompanied by an explanatory note.</p>

               <p>Series 6: Library History, 1939-2016 contains materials documenting significant events in the history of the library. Included in this series are news articles relating to the library, plans for library expansion and development, and ephemera from key library events. Also included in this series are pamphlets and documents outlining library skills and procedures, a timeline of library construction, and photographs of library staff. The Library Scrapbook, 1939-1941 housed within Box 28 is of particular interest. The scrapbook contains newspaper clippings and some copies of photographs documenting the first two years of Madison Memorial Library. Another item of interest, is correspondence from Madison College alumni Mary Wright Thrasher ('41) found in Box 26, Folder 1. In this letter to the former Dean, Ralph Alberico, she briefly mentions her remembrances of the library as a student when the library was housed in Harrison Hall. She also mentions that Carrier Library was not built until a few years after she graduated in 1941, although it opened to students in 1939. Items in Map Case 3:1 include architectural renderings of Rose Library showing placement of furniture on each floor of the library as well as architectural renderings for a new security entrance as well as poster titled New Library for the College of Integrated Science and Technology Campus, October 2004 with images of the CISAT campus with some construction being done. Also included in the map case are old Carrier Library floor plans.</p>
