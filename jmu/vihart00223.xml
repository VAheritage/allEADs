      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Thomas Newton Lindsey (b. 1818) and his wife Sarah Cook Lindsey (b. 1832) were residents of
        Churchville, Virginia in Augusta County at least through 1870. The Lindseys two young
        children, Mollie and Charlie, died in early March 1858 for undisclosed and seemingly
        unexpected reasons. The couple went on to have more children.</p>
      <p>Mr. Lindsey was employed as the postmaster for Churchville and as a merchant with Dinkle
        &amp; Lindsey, a general dealer in dry goods, groceries, and hardware in Churchville.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Thomas N. and Sarah C. Lindsey Letter, 1861, is comprised of one letter written by the
        Lindseys of Churchville, Virginia to a Mr. Wynant. The letter is dated June 24, 1861, just
        two months after the start of the American Civil War. While Mr. and Mrs. Lindsey addressed
        Mr. Wynant separately, resulting in two distinct letters, both letters are contained on one
        leaf. The Lindseys comment on the changes taking place in Churchville and the Shenandoah
        Valley as a result of the Civil War. Additionally, they mention the price and scarcity of
        goods, harvest yields, the evils of liquor, and general community news.</p>
      <p>Mr. Lindsey begins his letter by mentioning that he had recently seen Mr. Wynant's father
        and that all was well. He goes on to write that "Churchville is quite lonesome these times.
        Except on Saturday when the militia muster. The governor has ordered them to muster once
        every week. They are drafting the militia in Rockingham. There is some allready gone to some
        point down the Valley." Mr. Lindsey discusses the price and scarcity of goods - "I bought a
        few goods about the last of May. They were very scarce &amp; high, &amp; I have sold nearly
        out of some goods allready. I sold out of Bro. Cotton a few minutes ago." Mr. Lindsay closes
        his portion of the letter by discussing the recent harvest and requests updates "about the
        expected movements of the armies both north &amp; south, &amp; how the people are divided
        generally, as near as you can ascertain out there."</p>
      <p>Mrs. Lindsey begins her portion of the letter by mentioning that she and other young ladies
        in the community have been packing up clothes and "fixing pockets for the gentleman." She
        herself made several jackets. It seems likely that she is referring to community men going
        off to war. She continues with gossipy news and expresses a similar sentiment as her husband
        by writing that "Churchville is a changed place, it makes one feel sad." Mrs. Lindsey ends
        by mentioning George Hanger. She writes: "I understand [he] is taking two barrels of liquor
        with him. The ladies are all down on him; he had better not let it come this way. I consider
        it his worst enemy. I hope it shall not be used as a beverage; it will I am afraid destroy
        more of our men than the enemy."</p>
