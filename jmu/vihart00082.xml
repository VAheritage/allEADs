</head>
      <p>Samuel Shacklett was born in 1804, probably in Fauquier County, Va. By 1838 he had become a very successful businessman in Harrisonburg and in that year was elected a trustee of the city. He lived upstairs in a
large brick house on a corner of Court Square, with his store below. He also owned a frame building on Main Street, the lower floor of which he used as a wareroom; the upper story was called Shacklett's Hall and
was used for church services by Old School Baptist and Episcopalian congregations. In 1860 Shacklett was named a commissioner of the Harrisonburg Savings Bank by an Act of Assembly. He died in 1886 and his son
Henry continued the business for many more years.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Purchases of food, clothes, shoes, tools, household items, brandy, pills, turpentine, paper, tobacco, candy, books, and other items are documented with price, name of customer, and name of person who came for
the articles. The name, "Shacklett," is penciled in the front of the 1851-1852 daybook; two slips of paper in the 1845 book carry the names John Dougherty and Geo. Bruffy, who may have been business partners. Many
prominent Harrisonburg residents are listed as customers, including the Harrison family.
