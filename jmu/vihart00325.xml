         <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
         <p>Edna Mattie Tutt was born in Everton, Kansas on January 23, 1904. After receiving her bachelor's degree in sociology at Parsons College in Iowa and her doctorate from the University of Kansas in 1931, she moved to Harrisonburg to teach with her husband, Otto Frederikson (1892-1973) at James Madison University. She taught English at JMU from 1931 to 1941. Throughout her time as a teacher and student she was already working on her first manuscript, titled <emph render="italic">Three Parts Earth</emph>, the first in an already planned anthology series she planned to call <emph render="italic">The Idea of Love</emph>. The books that would comprise this would involve the evolution of a young woman as she struggles to get her manuscripts published, while simultaneously exploring and refining her own views on life and relationships. After Otto retired in 1957, the couple traveled extensively until Otto's death in 1973. Long after settling down in Harrisonburg, Edna released a collection of poetry entitled <emph render="italic">Never Tomorrow</emph>, published in 1988. Before she could finish her anthology series, Edna passed away on February 7, 1998.</p>

      <scopecontent id="aspace_48f2889797e738aa725838ea0cb29ed7">
         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Edna Frederikson Papers encompass one bound diary and 3 unpublished manuscripts, all created between 1972 and 1992. The diary focuses primarily on Edna's day-to-day thoughts concerning her manuscripts and her own personal musings. The three typed manuscripts are titled <emph render="italic">The Burning Ice</emph>, <emph render="italic">A Pilgrim of the Heart</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The Idea of Love</emph>, and follows the story of Nancy Western, a fictional character who navigates the trials and tribulations of becoming a published author and realizing her true self in the twentieth century.</p>
         <p>Edna's diary, spanning from 1972 to 1992, follows the day-to-day musings of its author. Within these pages, Edna attaches correspondence from family, friends, book publishers, editors, and other business relations. The diary can be read almost as a story, with personal interjections and context for any article that she decides to put in. Some items of note include a letter from acclaimed poet Katherine Anne Porter regarding one of Edna's works, letters and personal correspondence between herself and close friend Paul Pines as well as Irma Friedrich, scattered letters regarding her manuscripts (both lauding and critical), and assorted poetry.</p>
         <p>The manuscripts are organized as an anthology, following the character of Nancy Western as she struggles with her personal relationships and her work as an author working to get a book published. Although pure speculation, many parallels can be drawn between Nancy's life and Edna's, and can potentially read as Edna's reflection on her own life. The manuscripts were meant to be read as a larger narrative, titled <emph render="italic">The Idea of Love</emph>, but were separated into smaller "books" after unsuccessful attempts to get the entire anthology published.</p>
