         <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
         <p>Sarah McCulloh Lemmon was born in Davidsonville, Maryland on October 24, 1914 to William
            Presstman Lemmon and Anna Stewart Lemmon. By her own account, Lemmon moved frequently
            during her childhood, living in Atlanta, Georgia; Natural Bridge, Virginia; Roanoke,
            Virginia; and Nashville, Tennessee. Lemmon enrolled at the State Teachers College in
            Harrisonburg in the fall of 1930. While enrolled, Lemmon participated in numerous
            extracurricular activities, among them the Art Club, Y.W.C.A, Debate Team, and several
            athletic teams. Additonally, Lemmon served as Editor-in-Chief of <emph render="italic"
               >The Breeze</emph> during her senior year. In recognition of her varied interests and
            talents, Lemmon received the double superlative of "Most Literary/Most Intellectual" of
            the Class of 1934. Lemmon graduated from the State Teachers College in 1934 with a
            degree in high school education.</p>
         <p>After leaving Harrisonburg, Lemmon went on to a distinguished academic career. She
            earned a master's degree in history from Columbia University (1936) and a Ph. D. in
            history from UNC-Chapel Hill (1952). She taught at the high school level from 1934 until
            1947 when she began teaching history at Meredith College in Raleigh, North Carolina. In
            addition to teaching, Lemmon served as the history department head before retiring in
            1984. During her career, Lemmon published extensively on North Carolina history,
            including books on the state's participation in the War of 1812, World War I and World
            War II, and on the Pettigrew family of North Carolina. In 1997, Lemmon was the inaugural
            recipient of the Ronald E. Carrier Alumni Achievement Award which aims to recognize
            alumni who have demonstrated significant achievements of enduring value to society.</p>
         <p>Lemmon's intellectual pursuits were far-reaching and unabated in the face of her
            advancing age. In 1991, at the age of 77, Lemmon became the first person to earn a
            degree in art history from Meredith College. After moving from Raleigh to Southern
            Pines, North Carolina in 1991, Lemmon became very active in the local Episcopal Church,
            and in 1995, at the age of 81, she was ordained an Episcopal minister. Lemmon passed
            away on September 28, 2002 at the age of 87. She is buried in Marietta, Georgia at the
            Saint James Episcopal Cemetery.</p>
