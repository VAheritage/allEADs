      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Jack Allen Gaines (1930-2016) was born in Dayton, Virginia to Edward Walston and Agnes
        Zirkle Gaines. He was a member of Harrisonburg High School's class of 1948 and in the months
        following graduation was placed on the "Approved List of Local Men" at Madison College. As a
        result, he was permitted to make social calls on students. He went on to marry Rosalie
        Ritchie Gaines, who does not appear to have been a Madison College student. Gaines served in
        the U. S. Air Force from 1950 to 1954, was awarded the Korean Service Medal, and was a
        member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.</p>
      <p>Hope Vandever Miller (1904-1985) served as the Dean of Women at Madison College from
        November 1943 to June 1953.</p>
      <p>Local unmarried men who were enrolled in college, graduated from college, or left college
        in good standing had the privilege of dating Madison students without being placed on the
        "Approved List of Local Men." All other unmarried men who resided within the Harrisonburg
        city limits needed to be added to the "Approved List of Local Men" in order to date students
        at Madison College. Placement on the "Approved List" required a recommendation from a member
        of Madison College faculty or administrative staff. Conversely, men deemed ineligible to
        make social calls on students due to questionable behavior or having been expelled from
        their college were blacklisted. Both lists were kept in the office of the secretary in
        alumni.</p>
