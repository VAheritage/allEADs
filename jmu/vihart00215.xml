        <p>Based on an earlier iteration of the collection title (Edna T. Shaeffer Retirement
          Album), this collection of letters was likely bound in an album or scrapbook at some
          point. The current state of the letters is that they are all loose. It is unclear when
          they were removed from their original housing or what became of the album. In order to
          streamline the process of applying collection numbers, Special Collections staff completed
          a large-scale renumbering campaign in the spring of 2017. <emph render="bold">This
            collection was previously cataloged as SU 93-0331.</emph></p>

      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Edna Trout Shaeffer was born near Harrisonburg on January 11, 1886 to Edmund Shaeffer and
        Dora M. Shaeffer. She studied music in Boston and New York and became Glee Club Director at
        the State Normal School for Women at Harrisonburg in 1916, a position she held until her
        retirement in 1956. Shaeffer was also a member of the music faculty and, in addition to the
        Glee Club, she worked with the Madison College Chorus. Perhaps the most significant
        highlight from her tenure at Madison occurred in March 1956 when Shaeffer, along with 29
        Glee Club members, performed for service members in Keflavik, Iceland; Lajes Field, Azores;
        and Kindley Air Force Base, Bermuda. The performances were part of an Easter Concert Tour
        with the Military Air Transport Service Division of the United States Air Force. Other
        highlights include performances in Winchester's Apple Blossom Festival, singing partnerships
        with other colleges, performances with the National Symphony Orchestra, and a 1955 trip to
        Florida to sing with the Federation of Music Clubs.</p>
      <p>Outside of the college, Shaeffer served as Director of Music and organist at Harrisonburg's
        First Presbyterian Church for 52 years. She was a former president of the Virginia
        Federation of Music Clubs and was a member of the American Guild of Organists.</p>
      <p>Shaeffer died September 12, 1959 and is buried at Woodbine Cemetery in Harrisonburg.
        Shaeffer's impact on the JMU community reached well beyond her time at the university and
        beyond her lifetime. The Latimer-Shaeffer Theatre opened in Duke Hall in 1967 and was named
        after Shaeffer and Mary Latimer, former head of the drama department at Madison College. The
        theatre closed in 2010 with a final production of "bobrauschenbergamerica." Additionally,
        the Edna T. Shaeffer Humanist Award is awarded to faculty members in the College of Arts and
        Letters and the College of Visual and Performing Arts for scholarly research projects on
        topics in the humanities.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Edna T. Shaeffer Retirement Letters, 1940, 1956, is a collection of approximately 60
        congratulatory letters presented to Shaeffer upon her retirement as director of the Glee
        Club from Madison College. Correspondents are former students who sang under direction and
        tutelage. The correspondents share fond memories and funny anecdotes of time spent in the
        Glee Club and express their appreciation of Shaeffer's leadership, knowledge, and expertise.
        Of particular interest is a letter from a former student, Helen, who wrote to Shaeffer just
        24 hours after giving birth to congratulate her on her retirement. A May 1, 1956 letter from
        Mrs. Walter E. Hoffman includes two black-and-white photographs of Hoffman. Other
        correspondents include Delphine Hurst Parsons, Mary Spitzer Etter, Inez Graybeal Roop, and
        Julia Smith Martin.</p>
      <p>Two letters not directly related to Shaeffer's retirement include a letter from Albert H.
        Franz of the United States Air Force expressing his appreciation of the Glee Club's
        outstanding entertainment provided to service personnel in Iceland, the Azores, and Bermuda.
        The second is a thank-you letter dated January 14, 1940 from Gray Pifer, music instructor at
        the Pythian Home in New Market.</p>
