<head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
<p>The Walton and Walton Collection, 1859-1900, is representative of the Walton and Walton Law Firm of Woodstock, VA. The Walton and Walton Firm was founded in the 1830s and operated until the 1930s. Various generations of Walton family members have distinguished themselves as lawyers and statesmen, including: George Walton, signer of the Declaration of Independence from Georgia, born in Va.; and Morgan Lauck Walton, member of the firm and state senator responsible for enacting the Walton (ballot) Law of the 1890s.
</p>
<p>Several documents (mainly correspondence) within the collection represent John Edwin Roller, a prominent citizen of Rockingham County. Born near Mt. Crawford, VA, in 1845, Roller was a lawyer, lecturer, and antiquarian in Rockingham County. Roller attended the Virginia Military Institute and graduated in 1863. He served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War and served as a senator from 1869-1873. In January 1872, Roller became major-general of the 3rd division of the Virginia Militia. Roller also served as the president of the Rockingham County Historical Society.
