         <p>Elizabeth Arrena Carroll and her twin sister, Catherine Cornelia Carroll, both of Front
            Royal, Virginia in Warren County graduated from the professional courses at the State
            Teachers College, Harrisonburg in June of 1925. Elizabeth was a member of the Pinquet
            Tennis Club, Choral Club, the Athletic Association, and the YWCA. Her inscription from
            the 1925 <emph render="italic">School Ma'am</emph> reads, "For though on pleasure she
            was bent, She had a frugal mind." Cornelia's reads, "As brimful of mischief and wit and
            glee, As ever a human frame can be." Elizabeth played the mandolin, and it can be
            deduced from photographs and a permission slip from her mother to Dean Varner that the
            fashionable sisters enjoyed upper class privileges of visiting friends on weekends and
            receiving gentleman callers to campus.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Elizabeth Arrena Carroll Scrapbook consists of one 7" x 11 1/2" x 1 1/2" scrapbook,
            1921-1925. The scrapbook is purple felt with orange script lettering "Memories" and an
            "HTC" (Harrisonburg Teacher's College) insignia stitched in the orange felt and bound
            together with purple cotton cord. Contents of the scrapbook are mounted on black paper
            pages and consist of cards and letters from friends and family; multiple black and white
            photographs of the sisters and their friends both on and off campus; ephemera including
            tickets and programs from cultural and athletic events such as a Japanese operetta
            presented by the sophomore class, a May Day Festival Program, and a list of second year
            class priveleges. There is also an amusing though undated entreaty by Dorothy Garber to
            return for commencement (presumably in a year subsequent to 1925). A field day program
            lists six events: hurdles, triple jump, basketball distance, 75 yard dash, high jump,
            and relay followed by baseball at three in the afternoon. Several letters from a James
            in Washington, DC, mention automobile trips and train schedules.</p>
