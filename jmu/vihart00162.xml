			<head>Biographical Information </head>
			<p>James Madison University celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2008. As part of the
				celebration, the university decided to chronicle the happenings of the class of
				2008, often referred to as the Centennial Dukes. Students volunteered to write
				memories of their experiences from the start of their JMU career in 2004, until
				their graduation in 2008.</p>

			<head>Scope and Content </head>
			<p>The Centennial Dukes Scrapbook, 2004-2005, consists of 1.7 linear feet of material.
				Within this collection there are various pictures, newspaper clippings, magazine
				clippings, photographs, quotations, facts, captions, and writings that relate to the
				section that they are placed in. The scrapbook is organized into ten sections and
				each section was put into its own folder. The scrapbook follows a basic
				organizational structure in that each section has a title page followed by pages of
				information that relate to the general topic of the section. The scrapbook was
				created by the Centennial Dukes organization and it was created mostly by students
				with the supervision of a few faculty members. The use of the scrapbook was to
				document the freshman year of the class of 2008 and after they left it was meant to
				tell the story of what occurred in their freshman year in the form of visual and
				written explanation. </p>

		<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
