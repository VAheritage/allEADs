      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Jessie Jackson Stoutamyer was born November 12, 1892 in Lone Fountain, Virginia, a small
        community in Augusta County. She was one of eight children – George Eakle (1874-1911), J. S.
        (1878- before 1900), William E. (1881-1923), Sue Ella (1885-1976), Guy C. (1887-1963), Daisy
        (1890-1960), and Roy Samuel (1897-1969) – born to Andrew J. (1847-1925) and Sarah "Lula"
        Carlton Stoutamyer (1854-1929). Stoutamyer was unmarried and according to the 1940 census
        was living with her brother Roy, also unmarried. She passed away March 2, 1986 and is buried
        at Green Hill Cemetery in Churchville, Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Jessie Stoutamyer Diary, 1905, 1911, consists of one bound, and primitively
        hand-stitched, diary kept by 18-year-old Augusta County native, Jessie Jackson Stoutamyer.
        The pages are irregular and appear to be used paper bags. The presence of an address stamp
        on a few pages indicates that at least some of the bags originated from a business at 20
        West Main St. in Staunton. The diary spans January 1 through August 30, 1911, with a final
        entry mentioning her brother George's death on October 11, 1911. Stoutamyer's entries
        chronicle her daily activities and family news with frequent mentions of her siblings. She
        describes doing chores on the family farm (sawing wood, planting garden, and milking cows),
        keeping house (quilting, washing, cooking), and the comings and goings of her siblings and
        neighbors. Stoutamyer's final entry describes the passing of her eldest brother: "George
        died October 11th 1911 and was buried the 12 on my dead sisters birthday. I would like to be
        a million miles away from here." The sister referenced in this entry is likely "J. S.," the
        two-year-old daughter of Andrew and Lula Stoutamyer who is listed on the 1880 census. She is
        not listed on any further censuses.</p>
      <p>Also included is a separate sheet on which Stoutamyer transcribed "The Yellow Rose of
        Texas." An inscription is located on page two of the transcript. It reads: "Writon [sic] by
        Jessie Stoutamyer, Lone Fountain, Va., June the 12, 1905." While Stoutamyer was clearly
        literate, her frequent misspelling of simple words (stoar instead of store) and incorrect
        use of homophonous words (male instead of mail) indicate limited schooling.</p>
