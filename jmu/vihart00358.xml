               <p>This monograph provides a short history of the Church of the Good Shepherd, located at Folly Mills near Staunton, Va. on U.S. Rt. 11. Beginning as a non-denominational school in the early 1920s, it soon evolved into an Episcopal church with the main building being built in 1924. Although a small rural church, it has remained active. This history includes references to founding members; the construction of the building; factual information about services, clergy, church organizations (Women's Auxiliary, Ladies Society, Girls Friendly Society); prominent families; and relations with a nearby one-room public school (which closed in 1929). Also included is information about church education and social events (Sunday schools; lawn parties; and homecomings). Mention is also made of relief efforts for two Netherlands families following World War II. Accompanies copies of a finding aid to the Church's records and sample documents, including architectural drawings and photographs of church events and Sunday school classes; an advertisement for a lawn party; programs from Children's Day Services and the twenty-fifth homecoming anniversary; and pictures and correspondence with the two Dutch families</p>
