      <head>Historical Information 
</head>
      <p>Harrisonburg, in Rockingham County, Va., was named after Thomas Harrison, who settled in the area in 1737 and acquired several thousand acres of land.  Known as Rocktown for a short time, in 1779, Harrison deeded 2 1/2 acres of his sizeable holdings to the public, on which the first court house was built on present-day Court Square.  Shortly thereafter, Harrison deeded fifty more acres, which prompted the Virginia House of Delegates to recognize "Harrisonburg" as the county seat.  The town was governed by trustees until, as a result of an act by the Virginia General Assembly, in 1849, which outlined provisions for an elected mayor and town council, and established officially recognized boundaries for the "Town of Harrisonburg."
</p>
      <p>During the Civil War, Harrisonburg was used by Confederate and Union forces in their various marches through the nation. The population was divided in its loyalties, evidenced by the fact that the area's delegates to Virginia's assembly were opposed to secession. Cavalry officer Turner Ashby was killed near the town's borders.  By the turn of the century, Harrisonburg had annexed over 1,000 additional acres.  The Town Council Minutes, 1849-1859 thus document specifically the early years of Harrisonburg's official government, and more generally, the issues facing a small Virginia town in the antebellum South.
