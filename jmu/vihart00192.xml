      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Delphine Hurst Parsons was born Ida Delphine Hurst on February 21, 1910 to Bayard T. and
        Ida. L. Hurst of Norfolk, Virginia. Delphine attended Maury High School in Norfolk,
        graduating in 1928. In the same year, Hurst enrolled at the State Teachers College (later
        James Madison University) in Harrisonburg, Virginia. In addition to studying elementary
        education, Hurst participated in numerous extracurricular activities such as the university
        Bluestone Cotillion Club, Glee Club, Student Government, Lee Literary Society, and Debate
        Club. The financial constraints brought about by the Great Depression forced Hurst to return
        to Norfolk during what would have been her junior year at STC. Having already earned her
        two-year "normal degree," Hurst spent the year in Norfolk teaching fourth grade, taking
        courses through the College of William &amp; Mary's extension program in Norfolk, and
        attending summer school at STC. By 1930, Hurst had earned enough money to return to STC and
        complete her bachelor's degree on time in the spring of 1931. Hurst was elected to serve as
        president of her sophomore class and, in spite of her absence, was reelected to the
        presidency of the senior class in 1931. The 1931 STC yearbook, <emph render="italic"
          >Schoolma'am</emph>, lists Hurst as one of the "Most Intellectual" students of her
        graduating class.</p>
      <p> Upon completing her degree in 1931, Hurst returned to Norfolk where she worked as an
        itinerant music teacher, traveling by streetcar between city schools. She married James
        Edward Parsons (January 16, 1912 - December 10, 1986), also of Norfolk, in April of 1941.
        Following the birth of their daughter in 1949, Delphine temporarily left teaching, but she
        made a return in 1958 as a teacher of history and English at Hargrave Military Academy in
        Chatham, Virginia. Hurst continued working at Hargrave until her retirement in 1975. Just as
        it had been at STC, Delphine's spare time was filled with music. She directed the Hargrave
        glee club, several church choirs, and she often played as a piano accompanist in Chatham. </p>
      <p> Delphine passed away on December 14, 2001 and was buried alongside her husband in
        Hillcrest Memorial Park in Chatham, Virginia. She is remembered by her daughter Elizabeth
        Harper as a lover of music as well as travel and history. </p>
      <p> Nellie Morgan Cowan Williams was the closest, lifelong friend of Delphine Hurst Parsons.
        Nellie was born in Norfolk, Virginia on November 2, 1908 to William J. and Mattie M. Cowan.
        Cowan and Hurst attended Maury High School and, later, the State Teachers College in
        Harrisonburg together, both completing their degrees in 1931. The two women shared a love of
        music, and Nellie in particular was known for her extraordinary singing voice. While
        enrolled at STC, Cowan was a member of music organizations such as the Aeolian Club, Choral
        Club, Glee Club, as well as the Y.W.C.A, Lee Literary Society and Cotillion Club. Nellie
        returned to Norfolk, and later Virginia Beach, where she taught upper elementary school.
        Nellie wed Frank Taylor Williams in the 1960s. At the wedding, Delphine stood as Nellie's
        maid of honor just as Nellie had done for her so many years before. The marriage was cut
        short by the untimely death of Frank Williams in June 1966. Nellie passed away on April 10,
        1998 and is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Norfolk. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p> The Delphine Hurst Parsons Papers, 1923-1976, bulk 1923-1931, consist of one legal size
        half-Hollinger box containing folders of loose documents, two Hollinger boxes containing
        seven yearbooks from Maury High School and the State Teachers College, and three oversize
        flat storage boxes housing two scrapbooks and newspapers. Except for three yearbooks
        belonging to Nellie Cowan, this collection contains only papers created and collected by
        Delphine Hurst. The collection contains paper ephemera such as tickets, programs, calling
        cards, and nametags as well as correspondence, newspapers, and memorabilia acquired during
        Hurst's time spent at Maury High School (Norfolk, Virginia) and the State Teachers College
        in Harrisonburg. As such, virtually all of the material contained within covers a time
        period from 1923 to 1931. Two items fall outside of this time period: one vinyl record of
        the Madison College Choir Concert of 1966 and a single photograph from a 1976 reunion of STC
        students featuring Delphine Hurst and Nellie Cowan alongside several other former
        classmates. </p>
      <p> Much of the correspondence contained within pertains directly to club, sorority, and
        academic activities; there is little personal (i.e. non-school related) correspondence. The
        bulk of the papers from Hurst's high school years (1924-1927) are contained in a green
        scrapbook. From her high school years, Hurst collected newspaper clippings covering Maury
        High School athletics, theater productions, debate club, and student academic activities.
        Hurst also collected postcards, brochures, and newspaper clippings pertaining to Camp
        Owaisa, a now-defunct YWCA camp in Virginia Beach. Loose and oversized items found within
        the front cover, back cover, and pages of the high school scrapbook were removed and placed
        within separate folders that are housed alongside the scrapbook in a flat storage box. </p>
      <p> While attending the State Teachers College, Hurst collected dance cards from the Cotillion
        Club, score cards from the Debate Club, newspaper clippings covering the Glee Club, photos
        of campus and of classmates, notes and letters pertaining to student government, numerous
        playbills and programs from student theatrical productions, written feedback on her student
        teaching performance, letters relating to the Kappa Delta Pi honor society, and programs
        from university events such as alumnae banquets and the Wilson Hall dedication on 1931 (an
        event at which Hurst, the sitting senior class president, delivered an address). Most
        STC-related documents are secured within a blue scrapbook, while loose documents are
        organized by topic and housed within a single legal size half-Hollinger box. </p>
      <p> The Hurst Parsons Papers also contains several issues of <emph render="italic">The
          Breeze</emph> from the years 1930 and 1931, as well as issues of the <emph render="italic"
          >Baltimore American</emph> (5/24/1931), <emph render="italic">Norfolk Ledger
          Dispatch</emph> (5/27/1931), <emph render="italic">Daily News-Record</emph> (5/16/1931),
        and a special insert from the <emph render="italic">Alexandria Gazette</emph> (10/1931)
        dedicated to the bicentennial of George Washington's birth. Newspapers are housed within a
        single flat storage box. The vinyl record of the Madison College Choir Concert of 1966 is
        housed with the newspapers. </p>
      <p> Rounding out the Delphine Hurst Parsons Papers are four yearbooks from Maury High School,
        entitled <emph render="italic">The Commodore</emph>, as well as three <emph render="italic"
          >Schoolma'am</emph> yearbooks from STC. As indicated by signatures within the yearbooks,
        Delphine Hurst owned the following: <emph render="italic">The Commodore</emph> 1925, 1926,
        and 1927 as well as <emph render="italic">The Schoolma'am</emph> of 1931. Nellie Cowan owned
          <emph render="italic">The Commodore</emph> of 1927 and <emph render="italic">The
          Schoolma'am</emph> of 1928 and 1929. These yearbooks contain the signatures of their
        owners as well as well-wishes of classmates. Though few loose items were found within the
        pages of these yearbooks, some are of note, including a pamphlet by John W. Wayland entitled
          <emph render="italic">A Bird's-Eye View of the Shenandoah Valley with Map</emph> and a
        program from the State Teachers College commencement exercises of June 7, 1931. </p>
