      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Thelma Dunn Gregory, born Thelma C. Dunn, was born in 1906, and prior to her studies at the
        State Teachers College, resided in Baskerville, Virginia. She matriculated into the State
        Teachers College at Harrisonburg in 1923 and graduated in 1927. She was active in the arts,
        and was a member of the Stratford Dramatic Club, Lee Literary Society, Alpha Literary
        Society, the High School Club, and the YWCA. She appeared to have studied secondary
        education, and photos establish a connection to McLean High School, in McLean, Virginia, in
        1927, possibly the location of her student teaching. She graduated in 1927. Thelma Dunn
        married Carson Wilber Gregory. She died in 1998.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Thelma Dunn Gregory Scrapbook is comprised of one bound scrapbook containing
        memorabilia, correspondence and ephemera from Gregory's time as a student at the State
        Teachers College at Harrisonburg from 1923-1927. The collection also contains a file of
        loose photographs from her time as a student, and a file with ephemera, including a plastic
        spoon, shadowgraph glasses and three issues of the Breeze from 1927. The scrapbook documents
        Gregory's involvement in various clubs and societies, including the Stratford Dramatic Club,
        Lee Literary Society, Alpha Literary Society, the High School Club, and the YWCA. It
        includes notes exchanged between society members, as well as playbills from dramas, dance
        recitals and voice recitals.</p>
      <p>The scrapbook contains Gregory's "program card" and enrollment cards, with her course
        information and schedules during her time as a student. The scrapbook includes a complete
        schedule of all third quarter classes, printed by The Breeze in 1927. </p>
      <p>There is evidence of an active social life, with items from social gatherings at
        Harrisonburg places of business ("Candyland homemade candies and ice cream" and a soda
        fountain menu from the Hemp &amp; Walter Druggists), as well as Valentine cards, invitations
        to dances, poems, drawings, and clippings with fashions of the day. The scrapbook contains
        many letters written to her while at college, notes from her friends, and diary entries
        referring to outings with her boyfriend, "Iky." The scrapbook contains mementos from travel
        to Niagara Falls, Richmond, Staunton, and Baskerville, Virginia, her home town. </p>
      <p>Photographs in the scrapbook document her dramatic roles, and time spent with friends on
        campus. Many of the loose photographs have names and dates on the back.</p>
      <p>The scrapbook is a compiled in a purple bound book with gold script lettering, "Memory
        Book," and measures 17" x 12-1/2." It was published by the College Memory Book Co., of
        Chicago, Illinois. </p>
