         <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
         <p>William Herbert Ingham, a distinguished member of the James Madison University physics faculty for over three decades, was born November 29, 1947 in Rochester, New York. He received his S.B. (Scientiae Baccalaureus) in physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1968 and went on to complete his M.S. in astronomy from California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1969. Ingham returned to MIT and received his Ph.D. in astrophysics in 1976. Dr. Ingham began teaching at JMU in September 1976 and remained a member of the physics faculty until his retirement in July 2010.</p>
         <p>During his tenure at JMU, Dr. Ingham served as head of the Physics Department from 1986 to 1989 and also served in an acting role as Associate Dean/Acting Dean, Letters and Sciences (1989-1990) and Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs (1990-1991). Dr. Ingham's accomplishments related to furthering the science curriculum are numerous. He taught over thirty discrete physics courses as well as courses in many other disciplines such as chemistry and math and championed a new computational science concentration. He also developed and taught four offerings of an introductory fluid mechanics course beginning the 1980-1980 academic year. In partnership with the History Department, Dr. Ingham was instrumental in creating the history of science curriculum first offered in the 1992-1993 academic year. Related material is located in the Teaching &amp; Coursework series of this collection.</p>
         <p>Dr. Ingham was an advocate for the physics department during university restructuring in the mid-1990s and was also an influential and involved faculty member beyond the physics department and beyond JMU. He served on the Faculty Handbook Task Force which was charged with editing the faculty handbook. This included editing and revising the expectations, rights and responsibilities of the faculty, and outlining the relationship between faculty members and the university. He also served on the Faculty Senate. Dr. Ingham was awarded the Distinguished Teaching Award for the College of Sciences and Mathematics for academic year 2002/2003. Recommended by the Council for International Exchange of Students (CIES) for a Lecturing/Research award under the 2004-2005 J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Program. He was awarded a grant and subsequently spent the fall semester 2004 teaching physics and conducting research at Acadia University in Nova Scotia, Canada as a faculty-in-residence.</p>
         <p>Dr. Ingham was professionally active throughout his career, serving as a member of the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT), particularly the Chesapeake Section (CSAAPT), and Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society. He was a grader for Advanced Placement (AP) physics examinations for several years. Between 1994 and 2000, Dr. Ingham served on the AP Physics Development Committee, a six-member national committee that writes the AP physics examinations; he chaired the committee from 1997 to 2000.</p>
         <p>Since retirement in 2010, Dr. Ingham has remained active in the JMU community as a member of the Faculty Emeriti Association and continues to lecture on topics relating to black holes and gravitational waves.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The William Ingham Papers (1945-2013), consisting of 31.36 cubic feet (94 Hollinger boxes and 2 half-Hollinger boxes), contain the professional and academic papers of Dr. William Ingham, professor emeritus of physics at James Madison University. The materials chiefly relate to Dr. Ingham's tenure as a physics professor at JMU between 1976 and 2010, including lecture notes and PowerPoint presentations, homework assignments, syllabi, examinations and keys, and related course documents. Other materials relate to Ingham's scholarly pursuits both related and unrelated to physics including Dr. Ingham's research on James Madison and the sciences. Materials documenting Dr. Ingham's involvement in professional organizations and his commitment to professional development comprise a sizable portion of the collection. Much of the correspondence throughout the collection was generated using the VAX email system.</p>

               <p>Arranged in two subseries. Series 2.1: Courses is arranged alphabetically by course number (beginning with physics) then numerically by course number. Series 2.2: General Teaching is arranged alphabetically.</p>
               <p>This series, comprising the bulk of the collection, contains Dr. Ingham's teaching materials and coursework when he was a professor at James Madison University. Dr. Ingham taught throughout multiple departments. As such, his course material spans the subjects of physics, math, chemistry, computer science, history, liberal studies, and honors. Dr. Ingham was instrumental in creating courses on the history of science taught in the history department and taught many other liberal studies courses, including freshman seminar, women in science, and seminars in nuclear war. Included in these files are syllabi, tests, lectures, notes, handouts, homework assignments, and course evaluations for various classes throughout his career at JMU. This series also contains handouts and lecture materials not associated with specific courses. This series is organized into two subseries –2.1. Courses and 2.2. General Teaching – which separates the material related to specific courses from miscellaneous teaching materials not necessarily associated with one particular course. </p>

               <p>Arranged alphabetically.</p>
               <p>This series consists mostly of scholarly articles and handwritten notes by Dr. Ingham pertaining to his scholarly pursuits, some of which are not directly related to physics. Many of these scholarly articles have dates handwritten in the top left corner of the page, which indicate when he actually printed or used these articles. If no date was written on them, then the date of publication is used for description purposes. This series also contains correspondence between Ingham and various scholars about their work, such as edits for textbooks and book reviews. Dr. Ingham conducted much research on James Madison and the sciences; related documentation is included. Large collections of Wikipedia and other web page printouts were removed and given back to the donor.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Arranged in three subseries: 4.1. JMU Materials is arranged alphabetically, 4.2. Physics Department Materials is arranged alphabetically, and 4.3. Canadian Faculty Residency is arranged alphabetically.</p>
               <p>This series contains information pertaining Dr. Ingham's role in the JMU community and the physics department specifically. Dr. Ingham's time spent as a faculty-in-residence at Acadia University in Nova Scotia, Canada is also well-documented. The JMU materials include papers from JMU sponsored events and Dr. Ingham's role in JMU task forces and committees. For example, Dr. Ingham played a pivotal role in editing the faculty handbook as a member of the Faculty Handbook Task Force; related materials are included. Also included in this series are annual departmental evaluations, Dr. Ingham's personal faculty evaluations and performance reviews, and information pertaining to Ingham's tenure application. Of particular interest are the materials (including photographs) related to Physics Teaching Resource Agents (PTRA) – a summer institute at JMU to train rural high school physics teachers. Documents related to visiting scholars, lecturers, including Isaac Asimov who spoke at the 1979 Arts and Sciences Symposium, and various grant proposals are contained within this series. Dr. Ingham was awarded a major grant funded by the Appalachia Education Laboratory entitled "Interdisciplinary Science: Transforming Educational Experiences" (ISTEE) "to develop a college-level interdisciplinary physical science course that will satisfy JMU's general-education requirements and will be particularly appropriate for prospective middle school teachers." This series is organized into three subseries – 4.1. JMU Materials, 4.2. Physics Department Materials, and 4.3. Canadian Faculty Residency. </p>
