      <head>Bio/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Charles H. Shuler was born December 16, 1871 to Daniel Preston Shuler and Sarah Long Shuler
        of Port Republic, Virginia. Shuler was a farmer and taught public school in Georgia and
        Rockingham County, Virginia. Shuler was a member of the Port Republic Methodist Church and,
        according to his obituary, "was a man of many friends." He married Janie C. Martin (b.
        1887), daughter of Samuel Smith Martin and Betty Ames Martin of Accomack County, Virginia,
        in February 1910. Per their marriage announcement, Charles Shuler was the principal of Port
        Republic High School at the time of their nuptials.</p>
      <p>The Shulers, according to the 1920 census, were residents of Westchester County, New York
        where Charles Shuler taught and Janie Shuler was matron at the New York Juvenile Asylum.
        They returned to Rockingham County, Virginia by 1921 when Janie Shuler matriculated into the
        State Normal School for Women at Harrisonburg. She was involved in the High School Club,
        Athletic Association, French Circle, and the Y. W. C. A. Janie was known as "Mrs. Shuler" by
        her fellow classmates and was described as being quiet, calm, dignified, and always on time.
        She earned a professional diploma in 1923. By 1930, both Shulers were employed as public
        school teachers.</p>
      <p>Charles Shuler died May 6, 1936 and is buried at Port Republic Cemetery. After her
        husband's death, Janie returned to school and earned her Bachelor of Science degree in
        Elementary Education from Madison College in 1939. Sometime after graduation, Janie Shuler
        moved to Shenandoah County to teach public schools. She is listed in the 1940 census as a
        boarder in the home of Ray Rinker. Janie Shuler died November 21, 1976 in Durham, North
        Carolina. She is buried at Saint Georges Episcopal Church Cemetery in Pungoteague,
        Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Shuler Family Papers, 1893-1930, are comprised of one scrapbook of recipes and home
        remedies, three ledgers, and one State Normal School course notebook created by the Shuler
        family of Port Republic, Virginia.</p>
      <p>The scrapbook is a bound ledger comprised of newspaper clippings and handwritten notes of
        recipes and home remedies. It is indexed alphabetically by food category and home remedy
        type (e.g. bedbugs, breads, cakes, headache cures, etc.). Originally serving as an account
        book, the ledger was repurposed into a scrapbook, presumably by Janie Shuler. Based on pages
        that are not covered by newspaper clippings, the account book dates from approximately 1893
        to 1901. Little can be gleaned about the account book other than it was likely a ledger for
        a store operated by the Shuler family. Items purchased and recorded in the account book are
        of the household goods variety and include foodstuffs, clothing, and other basic
        necessities. The account book was repurposed into a scrapbook by at least the mid to late
        1920s, based on the dates present on newspaper clippings. The scrapbook exhibits significant
        acid burn from the many newspaper clippings laid in and pasted to the pages.</p>
      <p>Loose items, including newspaper clippings, handwritten recipes, ephemera, and
        correspondence, were removed from the scrapbook and foldered separately. They are arranged
        in the order they were removed from the scrapbook. Included is an owner's manual for the
        Wonder Can Sealer distributed by Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. and various materials related to
        raising chickens. Included in the correspondence is one letter to Janie Shuler from her
        mother dated April 16, 1927 and one letter, postmarked July 1, 1915, to a Mary J. Nicholas
        from her sister Nora. The letter was addressed care of Daniel Preston Shuler, Charles
        Shuler's father.</p>
      <p>The collection also includes a multi-use ledger dated 1906-1929. "The Electric Light Co.
        1010-12 Quebec St. Allentown, Pa." is handwritten on the front flyleaf. However, the content
        within, while of a disparate sort, does not appear to have any relation to this company. The
        first seven pages date to the fall of 1906 and are comprised of a member list and meeting
        minutes for the Sumter County, Georgia teachers. This was likely kept by Charles Shuler
        while he was a public school teacher in Georgia. The remainder of the ledger is comprised of
        daily expense and income accounts, presumably for the Shuler family.</p>
      <p>A second ledger, dated 1921-1923, with accounting information related to Daniel Preston
        Shuler is included. The ledger also contains daily time accounts for a worker by the name of
        McKenley.</p>
      <p>Also contained within the collection is a course notebook belonging to Janie Shuler while
        she was a student at the State Normal School for Women at Harrisonburg. The two-ring binder
        was separated from the course notes within and retained due to internal annotations. Janie
        kept notes on Shakespeare, sociology, poetry, eighteenth century literature, The Pilgrim's
        Progress, classical music, and mythology. She also lists the books required for History of
        Social Education. Programs from school productions are interleaved in the notes.</p>
      <p>Lastly, the collection includes an undated ledger book with a sketch of a schoolgirl on the
        front flyleaf. The ledger is otherwise blank.</p>
