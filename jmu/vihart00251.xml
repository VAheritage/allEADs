      <head>Bio/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The Virginia Central Railroad operated between 1850 and 1868, and eventually extended 206
        miles from Richmond, Virginia to Covington, Ohio. The Virginia Central Railroad originated
        as the much smaller Louisa Railroad, with the eastern terminus at Hanover Junction (about 20
        miles north of Richmond) and the western terminus in Charlottesville. Construction extended
        the railroad westward, and by 1859, it reached Covington, Ohio, 10 miles from the Covington
        and Ohio Railroad, which extended further westward. In 1968 the Virginia Central Railroad
        merged with the Covington and Ohio Railroad to form the new Chesapeake and Ohio (C&amp;O)
        Railroad.</p>
      <p>By 1860, the railroad went through the northern tip of Rockbridge County, with a single
        stop in in the town of Goshen, between stops in Craigsville in Bath County and Millboro
        Depot in Augusta County.</p>
      <p>The Virginia Central played an important role during the Civil War, transporting supplies,
        troops and mail for the Confederacy.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>

        on the Virginia Central Railroad. The property was owned by Joseph S. Ruff and was valued at
        $8. The document was signed by Leander Wright of the Virginia Central Railroad, and by
