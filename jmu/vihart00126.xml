			<head>Biographical Information </head>
			<p>The Warden family traces its history back to the earliest days of European settlement
				in the Shenandoah Valley. Records indicate a direct genealogical line to Jost Hite,
				believed to be one of the first European settlers. The family initially settled
				along the Lost River in Hardy County in the early 18th century when that county was
				still part of the commonwealth of Virginia. The family grew and prospered as farmers
				and merchants, as indicated by the 1806 ledger, which records regular trade
				transactions with ships bound for France, London, Dublin, Spain and the West Indies.
				Among the commodities purchased were French wines, sugar and rum from Barbados and
				Irish linens. Export items included finished leather, ox hides and tallow for making
				candles.</p>

			<p>The Nimrod Warden ledger accounts for business activities in Hardy County near
				Winchester, Virginia. This ledgers' historical significance directly correlates to
				the Shenandoah Valley and to the large industries that the Valley is known for
				today. The ledger describes the inventory for a business which appears to be that of
				a substantial wholesaler. The contents of this ledger illuminate national and
				international trade activities preceding the War of 1812, specifically the trade
				embargo. Even though the business accounted for in the Nimrod Warden ledger operated
				in harsh conditions of trade and was not located at a major port such as Boston it
				still thrived in commerce using the backdrop of the Shenandoah Valley. The monetary
				amounts in the ledger are in pounds sterling, demonstrating that even thirty years
				after the start of the revolutionary war the American trade industry still used
				pounds.</p>

			<head>Scope and Content </head>
			<p>The Warden Ledger Collection consists of three digital documents compiling 174
				images. The main ledger (Nimrod Warden) is 13.5 inches long and 8.5 inches wide. The
				name Nimrod Warden appears on the cover page of the ledger, it does not indicate if
				he was the owner or the bookkeeper. The words "Hardy County" appear at the top of
				almost every page and the dates covered are January 24 through December 24, 1806.
				This ledger gives a detailed accounting of the state of international trade between
				Jeffersonian America and Napoleonic Europe at the dawn of the 19th century.</p>



			<p>Included in the collection is an appraisal of the estate of Samuel Harnsberger of
				Augusta County, dated December 26, 1857. Handwritten notes (added in the 20th
				century) identify Samuel Harnsberger as the grandfather of Warden C. Parkins, Sr.,
				who was directly descended from the Warden family. The ledger is an accounting of
				Mr. Harnsberger's estate, which included livestock, furniture, farm equipment, and
				several pages of promissory notes for personal loans made by Mr. Harnsberger. One
				page of the ledger lists the names of twenty-five slaves of various ages. The 1850
				US census lists seventeen slaves owned by Samuel Harnsberger of Augusta County.
				Noted Shenandoah Valley historian John Wayland identifies a Samuel Harnsberger as a
				director of the Valley Turnpike Company, a public/private venture that developed a
				commercial route from Staunton to Winchester in the late 1830s which is still in
				service today as Virginia Route 11. The Harnsberger ledger includes a heading for
				"55 shares of Turnpike stock".</p>



			<p>The final ledger, dated November 5, 1880, also appears to be an accounting of an
				estate sale for the household goods of an unnamed woman. At the top of the first
				page is written "Mother's sale bill," and in a later note, possibly written with a
				felt-tipped pen, is the name "Susan Clagett Warden?" which has been crossed out.
				Genealogical records show that Susan Clagett Warden was a great-grandmother to
				Warden Parkins, mentioned in the Harnsberger ledger. Several of the items were
				purchased by Jacob and J.M. Warden, who are possibly Susan Warden's husband and
				brother-in-law, James McCoy Warden, respectively. Their mother, Lucinda Van Nort
				Warden passed away in April, 1880, and is very likely the "Mother" noted on the
				ledger. This accounting, like the Harnsberger sale, give a detailed look into the
				lives of Shenandoah Valley residents in the mid- to late-19th century.</p>
