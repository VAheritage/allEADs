         <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
         <p>Kathleen Chevallie Harless was born July 24, 1895 in Virginia. She attended the State Normal and Industrial School for Women at Harrisonburg for three years, from 1911-1914, and graduated with a Full Normal diploma, in 1914. Kathleen, sometimes called "Kittie" by her friends, was treasurer of the senior class, vice-president of the Stratford Society, a member of the Massanutten Camp Fire Girls, the Racket Tennis Club, Senior volley ball team, and voted "Best dressed" by her classmates. On June 12, 1920, Harless married James Alfred Beasley, son of William Beasley and Mary Rivers, in Christiansburg, Montgomery County, Virginia. They had two children: James Alfred Beasley, Jr. (b. 1921) and Robert Rivers Beasley (b. 1927). She died on October 5, 1988.</p>

         <p>The collection originally included copies of the Schoolma'am, from 1912, 1913, and 1914 and a diploma issued by the State Normal and Industrial School for Women to Kathleen Harless. The yearbooks were removed from the collection due to poor condition and duplication. The diplomas had been added to UA 0036, Diplomas.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Kathleen Harless Scrapbook contains photographs, invitations and programs that document Harless' experiences at the State Normal and Industrial School for Women at Harrisonburg, from 1911-1914, as well as entries in 1916, after she graduated. Also included are four postcards depicting campus grounds and buildings, dated 1911-1913, and a promotional flyer from 1982.</p>
         <p>The scrapbook contains many candid photographs of Harless' classmates and professors. Photographs depict faculty members such as Elizabeth Cleveland, Annie Cleveland, Rachel Gregg, Mary Bell, Natalie Lancaster, Mrs. R.B. Brooke, John W. Wayland, as well as candid photographs of President Julian Burruss and his wife, Rachel Cleveland Burruss. Other photographs depict students engaged in a "snow battle" on campus, May Day festivities, a photograph of "the day the work began on the new building" (likely Harrison Hall), images of the Coburn Players performing the Merry Wives of Windsor in the outdoor theater, and photographs of Harless dressed as "Phillippe," replete with a sword and cape, acting in the theater performance. Harless includes several pages of photographs dedicated to her friend, Lillian McGruder Chalkley, who graduated in 1915. The scrapbook also contains invitations and programs to Stratford Society events, and joint programs with the Lee and Lanier Society. Entries in 1916 contain calling cards and lists of gifts given to Harless for Christmas.</p>
         <p>The book, covered with blue fabric with an image of a young woman festooned in blue ribbon on the cover, is called "The Girl Graduate, Her Owned Book," and was published by the Railly and Britton Co. of Chicago.</p>
         <p>A folder of loose inserts contains postcards with views of campus, addressed to Anna Harless of Christiansburg, Virginia. They include a "View from State Normal School, Harrisonburg Va." (1913), which shows Jackson, Ashby and Zirkle house; "I heard the Shenandoah roll along the blow below…" (1911) which depicts Maury (Science), Jackson, and Ashby; "Dormitory No. 1, State Normal School, Harrisonburg, VA" (undated); and "The old Board walk that Leads to Town, State Normal School, Harrisonburg, Va" (1911). The folder also includes a James Madison University promotional flyer from 1982.</p>
