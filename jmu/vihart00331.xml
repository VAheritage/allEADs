         <head>Administrative History</head>
         <p>Harrisonburg's P. Bradley &amp; Sons was established in 1856 by Philo Bradley
            (1829-1908) as an iron foundry specializing in manufacturing plowshares and other iron
            tools. The foundry was originally located on the east side of High Street, but relocated
            to South High Street after flooding issues at the original location. With its
            manufacture of iron farming implements, the foundry supported the local and state
            agricultural community, as well as farming communities along the eastern seaboard. Philo
            sold the business to his son, Schuyler (1860-1939), in 1886 for $7,500. Schuyler's
            brother, John S. Bradley (1857-1936), also helped to operate the foundry at this time.
            At some point, Schuyler's sons, Burns (1887-1966) and Bennett (1893-1962), and John's
            son, Richard (1900-1978), took over the business from their parents. Schuyler Bradley II
            (1913-1988) and Curtis Bradley, both great-grandsons of Philo Bradley, oversaw the
            foundry's operations beginning in the 1940s through its closure in 1962.</p>
         <p>Over time, the foundry diversified its product line (stamped with a "PBS" maker's mark)
            to include reapers, kettles, polished wagon boxes, andirons, circular saw mills, road
            scrapers, municipal hardware, drain covers, and manhole lids. By the 1930s, P. Bradley
            &amp; Sons began losing its market share to the more durable and mass-produced, steel
            plowshares. The foundry ceased operations in 1962. The five buildings that made up P.
            Bradley &amp; Sons, located at 245 Old South High Street, were added to Harrisonburg's
            Historical District in 2017.</p>

         <p>The P. Bradley &amp; Sons Ledger, 1901-1903, documents the business activities of P.
            Bradley &amp; Sons, an iron foundry in Harrisonburg, Virginia.</p>
         <p>The ledger comprises an unpaginated alphabetic index of patrons (designated as both
            debtors and creditors) and 448 pages recording accounting information, sales, and prices
            for a variety of iron work including kettles, kettle stoves, plows, plowshares, grates,
            fire backs, etc. The ledger dates from May 13, 1901 to November 4, 1903.</p>
         <p>Corporate patrons include Harrisonburg Harness Company, Branner Brothers (Broadway),
            Chesapeake Western Railway, J[oshua] Wilton &amp; Sons, Franklin Tanning Company, First
            National Bank, Marshall &amp; Downs Milling Company (Bridgewater), Orange Mills
            (Orange), Rockingham Milling Company (McGaheysville), Sugar Grove Bargain Store,
            Shenandoah Institute (Dayton), Spirit of the Valley, Vesuvius Plow Works, Walton &amp;
            Walton, etc. Individual patrons include David Burkholder, Jacob Blosser, A.S. Hammack

            Customers from Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania patronized the
            foundry. There is accounting information within the ledger for patrons not listed in the
            index and, as such, the index should not be considered exhaustive.</p>
         <p>Five incomplete memoranda of agreement document an arrangement with P. Bradley &amp;
            Sons to provide a second party with one portable circular saw mill, one tooth circular
            saw, two cant hooks, belt punch, saw hammer, and saw file. These agreements are blank in
            that the specific details relating to the identity of the second party and the financial
            particulars of the agreement are not provided.</p>
