      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>John Frederick Pierson was born February 25, 1839 in New York, New York. He enlisted in the
        Union Army on May 27, 1861 in Washington, DC and was commissioned the same day into Company
        H, New York 1st Infantry division as a captain. Pierson earned a promotion to a major on
        July 20, 1861 and to a lieutenant colonel on September 10, 1861. He became a prisoner of war
        in Chantilly and was held at Libby Prison in 1862, being exchanged on September 21, 1862 in
        Aiken’s Landing, Virginia. Pierson would later be promoted a final time to a brigadier
        general on March 13, 1865, just two months before the end of the Civil War. Pierson
        continued an active involvement in veterans’ affairs in various ways in the post-war period,
        attending reunions of fellow soldiers and being involved in veterans’ societies, often
        holding positions of administration. He continued this active involvement until his death on
        December 20, 1932 in New York, New York.</p>
