      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Brocks Gap is an area of approximately 200 square miles in northwestern Rockingham County
        formed by the North Fork of the Shenandoah River. Due to primitive infrastructure that
        required fording the North Fork three times in order to exit Brocks Gap, Elder John Kline
        (1797-1864), Brethren Church leader and resident of nearby Broadway, proposed making
        improvements to Brocks Gap. These plans included cutting down the Gap rocks, making a road
        in the place of the cut, and erecting a bridge across one of the three fords. By 1880, the
        remaining two fords were replaced with a new road and bridge.</p>
      <p>Both photographs are attributed to B. B. O’Roark (likely Benjamin Branson O’Roark Jr.), a
        photographer in New Market.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Brocks Gap Photographs are comprised of two 4½ x 7½ inch black and white photographs on
        7 x 10 inch mounted board. Each mounted board is stamped with “B. B. O’ROARK, PHOTOGRAPHER,
        NEW MARKET VA.” The first photograph features a group of eight people, including four women
        and one man on a horse, standing by a piece of equipment, likely a steam tractor used for
        grading the roadway. The North Fork of the Shenandoah River is in the foreground. The verso
        of the photograph reads: “Brocks Gap Between the Two Cuts No. 2 Spring of 1905 W. J.
        Gochenour.” The second photograph features the same group of people and the same machinery.
        The verso reads: “No. 3 Brocks Gap road at the last big cut in the rocks Spring of 1905 W.
        J. Gochenour.” The top left corner of the mounted board has been broken off. It is unclear
        if Gochenour is one of the persons in the photographs or how he relates to the photographs.
        Cursory searches of the internet suggest that a W. J. Gochenour lived in Penn Laird,
        Virginia and was a miller by trade. Additionally, there was a different W. J. Gochenour
        practicing drilling in the Shenandoah Valley in the early to mid-twentieth century.</p>

      <p>Based on the numbers assigned to each photograph ("No. 2" and "No. 3" written on the
        versos), it seems likely that there must have been a “No. 1” in the series originally. A
        similar photo to the two in this collection was published in Lena Albrite Turner and Pat
        Turner Ritchie’s photographic history of the area entitled Brocks Gap. This photo, on page
        14 of the monograph, also features eight people standing by the same type of machinery.
        Therefore, it is possible that this photo, held in a private collection, is part of the same
        series of B. B. O’Roark photographs of Brocks Gap.</p>
