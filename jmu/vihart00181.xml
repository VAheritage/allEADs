      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Brothers Adam and Wayman Collins were from Wytheville, Virginia and served as Confederate
        soldiers during the American Civil War.</p> <p>Wayman (b. 1832) served in the Virginia Wythe
        Militia prior to the Civil War. He joined the Confederate Army on May 5, 1862. He was
        mustered into Company H of the Virginia 63rd Infantry. On April 11, 1864, the Wythe County
        Treasurer paid Wayman’s family $40.00 (Confederate), via voucher, for his service. On July
        20, 1864 he was listed as a POW in Atlanta, Georgia and then confined on July 31, 1864 in
        Camp Chase, Ohio. He was later transferred to City Point, Virginia on March 4, 1865 for a
        prisoner transfer. He lived the remainder of his life in Wythe County, Virginia.</p> <p>Adam joined
        the Confederate Army on April 9, 1862. He was mustered into Company B of the Virginia 51st
        Infantry. His family was paid $10.00 (Confederate), via voucher, for his service.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Adam and Wayman Collins Confederate Vouchers, ca. 1862-1864, consist of three partly
        printed Confederate vouchers issued by Wythe County, Virginia for resident Confederate
        soldiers.</p> <p>Two vouchers are filled out in payment to the family of Wayman Collins, one in the
        amount of $10.00 (Confederate) and the other in the amount of $30.00 (Confederate). Both are
        dated April 11, 1864. The third voucher is filled out in payment to the family of Adam
        Collins for the amount of $10.00 (Confederate). Each voucher is filled out to be issued as
        payment. The handwritten text is faded and nearly illegible.</p>
