         <head>Administrative History</head>
         <p>The Stratford Literary Society was formed in 1914, when members of the Lanier and Lee Literary Societies at the State Normal and Industrial School for Women at Harrisonburg joined to form an organization dedicated to the dramatic arts. The organization's primary emphasis was on reading theatrical works. In 1919 the Stratford Literary Society was reconstituted to form the Stratford Dramatic Club, or Sigma Delta Chi, and held yearly performances at the New Virginia Theater in downtown Harrisonburg. On April 4, 1950, the group changed its name to Stratford Players.</p>
         <p>The Stratford Players have had many faculty advisors over the years, including: James C. Johnston (1919-1921), Ruth Hudson (1921-1965), Argus Tressider (1935-1939), Leland Shubert (1939-1943), Ainslee Harris (1944-1945), Dr. Mary E. Lattimer (1946-1960), James O. Link (1960-1964), Nancy O'Hare (1964), and Horace Burr (1965-1973). In 1973, Stratford Players leadership changed from having a single advisor to a team of faculty, which in the early 1970s included Allen Lyndrup, Thomas L. King, Pam Johnson, Phil S. Grayson and Roger Hall.</p>
