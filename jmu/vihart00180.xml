         <p>Philip Henshaw Scott (1873-1962), was a native Virginian and a seventh generation
            descendant of James Madison. He was a member of the National Society of James Madison
            Family descendants and was in possession of several family heirlooms relating to
            Madison. Scott married Martha Moore Leitch on April 29, 1903. They went on to have five
            children: Philip Henshaw (1904-1914), William Wallace (1906-1931), Martha Moore
            (1908-1979), Meredith Leitch (1915-2002), and Johnny (1918-2009). He served as a career
            United States Coast Guard officer and commanded the USS <emph render="italic"
               >Seminole</emph>.</p>
         <p>In 1951-53, while living in Gordonsville, Virginia, Scott was asked to visit Madison
            College to tour the campus and its facilities for certain days honoring James Madison.
            Scott approved of the state of the college and believed it held up it its namesake.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Philip H. Scott Letters, 1951-1953, consist of four letters, three of which are
            addressed to Philip H. Scott, a seventh generation descendant of James Madison, from the
            Office of the Dean at Madison College. The fourth is a handwritten draft letter from
            Scott to Percy H. Warren, Chairman of the Madison Day Celebration.</p>
         <p>The first letter, by W. J. Gifford, Dean of Madison College, is dated March 21, 1951 and
            includes the envelope addressed to Scott. Gifford writes to Scott to thank him and his
            wife, Martha Moore Leitch Scott, for visiting Madison College for the celebration of
            James Madison's birthday.</p>
         <p>The second letter, by Percy H. Warren, Dean of the Summer Session at Madison College and
            Chairman of the Madison Day Celebration, is dated March 22, 1951. Similar to the first
            letter, Warren thanks Scott and his wife for making the visit to Madison College for the
            200th anniversary of Madison's birth. The envelope addressed to Scott is included.</p>
         <p>The third letter, handwritten by Philip H. Scott, is undated, but is in response to
            Warren's letter of March 22, 1951. In it, Scott thanks Percy H. Warren for the
            hospitality of Madison College and conveys that he greatly enjoyed the festivities of
            Madison Day. There are several edit marks on the back half of the letter, indicating
            this was likely a draft copy.</p>
         <p>The fourth letter, by W. J. Gifford, is dated November 16, 1953 and includes the
            envelope addressed to Scott. Gifford writes to thank Scott for donating a copy of John
            Adams' eulogy given at James Madison's funeral to the Madison College Library (possibly
            the eulogy contained in SC 2099). He goes on to express his condolences on the death of
            Scott's wife who died June 21, 1953.</p>
