         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>This oral history series studies the immigration of various ethnic groups into the Shenandoah Valley, starting with a review of past history (see background paper). Records interviews of individuals who provide services to refugees; also interviews of individuals representative of groups new to the area. Shows how these people are maintaining their cultural identities and how they are adapting to mainstream Valley culture. Studies reasons why they left their homeland; why they settled in the Valley; how their cultures differ; what troubles they have had maintaining their cultures; and how they perceive their reception by local residents. Interviews conducted with seven individuals providing services for immigrants include: Rev. Joseph S. Roberson, Alex Flores, Marlene Webb, Marta F. de Meza, Laura Draim, Sam Ritchie, and Sheryl K. Wyse. Interviews of new immigrants include: Willie Chavez, Ana Sanchez and Efraim Sanchez-Garcia, Tanya and Sasha Reut, and Thu Huynh. Series of five articles from Daily news-record (Harrisonburg, Va.), Dec. 28-29, 1995 include: Valley Hispanics fare well at orchards, poultry plants / Bettina Tilson; Mexican natives find good, bad in America / Bettina Tilson; Few Hispanics appear on welfare rolls / Chris Edwards; Tax laws require immigrants to pay / News-record staff; Hispanics working to adapt to life as Valley residents / Chris Edwards. Article from July 27, 1996: Hispanic census: Service group places count below estimates, refutes job/tax stereotype / Julie Collins.</p>

               <p>This interview records the viewpoints of Mrs. Ana Sanchez and Mr. Efraim Sanchez-Garcia about life as immigrants/Mexican-Americans in the U.S. Ana talks about her first experience in this country at the age of thirteen, about going back and forth between the two countries, separation from family, attempts to stay in school, and about various jobs she has had across the country (Utah, Wisconsin, Virginia), among them as a migrant worker. Efraim mentions his job at the local Wampler poultry plant. Ana talks about the language barrier, the value of and attempts to learn English (through classes and general association with others); also mentions her experiences as a translator for others. She and her husband Efraim compare and contrast life in California and Virginia and why they prefer the latter (because of crime in Cal. and the fact that they want to develop English skills, which they are better able to do because there are fewer Spanish-speaking people in Va.). They mention the amnesty program which Efraim took part in; illegal alien status, and attempts to get a visa/resident alien card; also about Mexican passports and the border between Juarez, Mexico and El Paso, Texas. They also talk about the value of the traditional Mexican family and mention the cultural and educational assimilation of Mexican American children. Recorded at the trailer home of Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez and their two children, south of Harrisonburg, Va., Feb. 23, 1993.</p>
