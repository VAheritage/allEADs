      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Mary Catherine Lyne was born on December 10, 1916 in Charles Town, West Virginia to John Julian and Sue
        Legge Lyne. Lyne enrolled at the State Teachers College in 1936 and
        graduated in 1940 with a degree in high school education. She participated in many
        extracurricular activities as a member of the Cotillion Club, the Lee Literary Society, Y.
        W. C. A., the Lost Chords musical organization, and <emph render="italic">The Breeze</emph>
        editorial staff as feature editor and editor-in-chief. She served as president of Kappa
        Delta Pi, an education honor society, and was her freshman class treasurer and sophomore
        class president.</p>
      <p>Rather than enter teaching, Lyne instead worked as an editorial assistant for a monthly
        trade magazine. Lyne joined the military in 1943 as a member of the first class of SPARS –
        the Women's Reserve of the Coast Guard created during World War II. SPARS was an acronym of
        the first letters of the Coast Guard motto and its English translation, Semper Paratus
        Always Ready. SPARS was deactivated in 1947, at which point Lyne was discharged as a
        Lieutenant of the United States Coast Guard Reserve. Lyne continued her writing career,
        working for the U.S. Public Health Service, the United States Information Agency, and the
        Inter Press Service. Lyne also coauthored <emph render="italic">Three Years Behind the
          Mast</emph>, a history of SPARS.</p>
      <p>Lyne spent most of her adult life in Silver Spring, Maryland before moving to
        Charlottesville in 1993. She died on August 20, 2001 in Charlottesville and was interred at
        Elmwood Cemetery in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Mary Catherine Lyne Papers, 1942-2001, contain photographs, newspaper and magazine
        clippings, memos, programs, and other personal papers relating to Lyne's time spent in SPARS
        during World War II. The collection also contains papers compiled by Lyne's niece, Kitty
        Landess, concerning the Lyne's death in 2001.</p>
      <p>Materials related to SPARS events include a program from a 1945 event called "Mlle Muster
        for Spars," which was likely an event co-sponsored by <emph render="italic"
          >Mademoiselle</emph> magazine and focused on re-acclimating SPARS women to their post-war
        lives. Accompanying the "Mlle Muster for Spars" program is a two-page essay recounting the
        event. Additional event materials include a program for the play "Wet Behind the Ears" by
        the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School, a memo from the District Coast Guard Office of New
        York City regarding uniform regulations, program from SPAR reunion of 1947, a series of ink
        drawings by Kay Stuurman, and a copy of the "Spar Song Book" containing sheet music.</p>
      <p>Rounding out the collection of SPARS-related items are 13 black-and-white photographs of
        SPARS women, including Mary Catherine Lyne, SPARS Director Captain Dorothy C. Stratton, and
        Henrietta Baker. Of particular interest is a photograph of Lyne sitting at the desk of L.
        Spencer (presumably Lyndon Spencer) reading a brochure with cigarette in hand. The
        inscription on the verso reads: "Mary Catherine Lyne (This is a doctored photo!) Mary is NOT
        L. Spencer rear admiral."</p>
      <p>Items compiled by Lyne's niece, Kitty Landess, include a death notice written by Landess
        and a copy of Lyne's obituary.</p>
