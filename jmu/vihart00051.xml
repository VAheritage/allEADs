<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Nancy Bondurant Jones began working for JMU in 1989 after retiring from teaching English at Turner Ashby High School.  She set out as social events coordinator for then-president Ronald E. Carrier and his wife, Edith, and later started writing Dr. Carrier's speeches and other documents as requested.  In the early 1990s, Dr. Carrier commissioned her to write a book on JMU history that would appeal to a general audience.  <title render="italic">Rooted on Blue Stone Hill</title> was published by the Center for American Places in July 2004.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Nancy B. Jones Collection consists of six folders within 1/2 Hollinger box, 1909-2000.  The collection primarily contains responses to forms Mrs. Jones sent to faculty emeriti and graduates soliciting personal experiences and memories for her book on JMU history.  In addition to providing Mrs. Jones with reminiscences, respondents also sent original documents and images.  Among these are several letters by Dr. Julian Burruss, first president of the college, to (Eleanor) Beatrice Marable, the first student applicant at the new school in 1909, and the text of a speech Ms. Marable gave in 1945.  Also included are interviews concerning the conflicts between Dr. Carrier and the faculty over the curriculum in the 1990s, a short memoir by Dr. Carrier, and an interview with Dr. Carrier's son, Michael.  The majority of form responses, letters, and interviews range from 1993 to 2000.
</p>
<p> The photographs in the Nancy B. Jones Collection, the greater part of which date from the 1920s and 1930s, portray Madison College students outdoors and indoors, as well as on special occasions such as Easter, graduation and at the Turkey Festival.  Photographs of the incoming class during freshmen week and of students participating in President Duke's annual trek to Massanutten Mountain are included.  A sub-collection of photographs relating to Eleanor Beatrice Marable is also present.  Furthermore, the collection contains photographs of Samuel P. Duke (second president of Madison College), John A. Sawhill's classes, a panorama shot of participants of the Shakespeare Pageant, as well as more recent photographs from the 1990s.
