      <p>The collection was reprocessed in 2016 and contains all documents from the original
        accession (PR 99-1122) except for the Faculty Minutes, 1908-1998, which were removed to form
        a separate collection (UA 0011). A copy of the original finding aid is located in the
        collection control file. Old collection folders were reused during reprocessing and folder
        titles were retained when possible. Inserts found in the Board of Trustees Minute Book were
        removed and foldered separately. The inserts were subsequently photocopied and those copies
        are also foldered separately. The Board of Visitors meeting minutes and President's Reports
        were originally bound, but were disbound in 2016 during reprocessing.</p>

      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>James Madison University's Board of Visitors was created in 1964 with the prime directive
        of overseeing the effective government of the university, then Madison College. When the
        institution opened in 1908 as the State Normal and Industrial School for Women at
        Harrisonburg, the governing body was its own Board of Trustees. The school changed its name
        to the State Normal School for Women at Harrisonburg in 1914 and governance was shifted to
        the Virginia Normal School Board, a state agency. The institution was renamed once again in
        1924 to the State Teachers College at Harrisonburg. The governance also experienced change
        as control was transferred to the State Board of Education. In 1964, the final change
        occurred when the Virginia General Assembly established independent boards of visitors for
        each of the state's former teacher colleges.</p>
      <p>The Governor of Virginia holds the power of appointing each member of the Board of
        Visitors. The first Board of Visitors was comprised of 11 members; its first rector was Burr
        P. Harrison. The Virginia General Assembly acted to have the board size increased to 15
        members in 1989. Of the selected members, no more than two can be non-Virginians and board
        members include both JMU alumni and non-alumni. In addition to appointed members, a student
        representative and the speaker of the JMU Faculty Senate serve on the board. Terms of
        service do apply as board members are not eligible to serve more than two consecutive
        four-year terms. Officers of the board (rector, vice rector, and secretary) are elected
        annually by the board for one-year terms.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Office of the President: Board of Visitors Records, 1908-2001, document the activities
        of the James Madison University Board of Visitors and its predecessor, the Board of
        Trustees. The collection is comprised primarily of meeting minutes and correspondence.
        Minutes from the Board of Visitors' first meeting on July 16, 1964 are included. Researchers
        should note that meeting minutes from the various iterations of university governing bodies
        between 1914 and 1963 are not included. The correspondence is chiefly official memoranda,
        letters concerning business and new board members, and contractual agreements granting
        faculty members temporary leaves of absence. The collection also includes annual reports and
        reports to the Board of Visitors, financial materials documenting lease agreements involving
        James Madison University, athletic program expenditure statements, and audit reports.
        Miscellaneous items include documents explaining the origins of buildings' names, a Board of
        Visitors manual, and a document of Board of Visitors Resolutions.</p>

            College," agreed upon making the meetings of the Visitors closed to the public, approved
            of the revised faculty salary, and approved the continuation of degrees being offered to
            students. Also included is the original Board of Trustees minute book dating from 1908
            to 1914. A full transcript is also contained within this series.</p>

          </head>
          <p><emph render="bold">Subseries 5.1: Leases/Legal Documents, 1922-1981</emph>, is comprised primarily of lease
            agreements between James Madison University, both as the lessor and lessee, and persons
            or companies. Of particular interest are the fire insurance documents which include a
            Schedule of Buildings at the State Teachers College at Harrisonburg (June 2, 1924) and a
            Fire Insurance Report (February 1932) prepared by the Philadelphia Fire &amp; Marine
            Insurance Company. The Schedule of Buildings lists all campus buildings, their
            architectural type, date of erection, and total cost. The Fire Insurance Report provides
            a detailed description of all campus buildings including date of erection, occupancy,
            recommendations, and estimated insurable value. Photographs are included with each
            building description.</p>
          <p><emph render="bold">Subseries 5.2: Budget Reports, 1961-1989</emph>, contains annual reports, financial reports
            detailing the university's business and financial operations, reports on audits prepared
            by the auditor of public accounts for the Commonwealth of Virginia, and a limited amount
            of material related to athletic program expenses. Researchers should note that the 1966
            expenditure statement for athletics is not included in this collection.</p>
