        <p>In February 2004, Louise Fontaine Baker sent a letter of her reminiscences of her life
          and of being a student at the State Teachers College at Harrisonburg to James Katzman,
          president of the JMU Alumni Association. It came by way of a <emph render="italic"
            >Montpelier</emph> magazine reply envelope and was intercepted by Michelle Hite,
          Assistant Editor of Montpelier magazine. Hite sent a facsimile of Baker's letter to Chris

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Louise Fontaine Baker Letter, 2004, is comprised of a five-page facsimiled account of
        Baker's life including her time as a student during the 1920s at the State Teachers College
        at Harrisonburg. In her account, Baker describes coming to campus to register: "My father
        accompanied me on the train to register for college. We passed a campus with stark grey
        stones ("Grey Stone hill" – in college song). I thought I was passing the Mental Institution
        in Staunton!" Of particular interest is Baker's description of her roommates: "My first
        roommates proved to be disasters! One became pregnant and had to leave school and the next
        one developed TB – which required me to be fully examined." Baker goes on to describe her
        teaching career, other universities she attended, and traveling.</p>
