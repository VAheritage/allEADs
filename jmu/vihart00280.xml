         <head>Administrative History</head>
         <p>Diplomas and certificates awarded by the State Normal and Industrial School reflected
            the various courses of study designed to prepare white women for teaching in rural
            Virginia schools. The first graduating class was June, 1911, in which twenty students
            received diplomas. </p>
         <p>The Regular Normal Course was a program designed to prepare women to teach in public
            schools. At the school's founding in 1909, the Regular Normal Course consisted of one to
            six years of study, and was open to students with little to no high school education. In
            1910, entrance requirements were raised, and women had to have completed at least two
            years of high school or hold a teaching certificate as a result of a state examination
            in order to attend, which meant that the Regular Normal Course went from a six-year to a
            four-year course of study. By 1914, the first two years of the Regular Normal Course
            (the equivalent of the last two years of high school) was reformed as the two-year
            Preparatory Course, and upon completion, students received a First Grade High School
            Certificate. Completion of the third year of the Regular Normal Course entitled a
            student to receive the Professional Certificate, so long as certain teaching
            requirements were met. Those who completed the fourth year of the Regular Normal Course
            received the Full Normal diploma, which amounted to a lifetime teaching certificate
            requiring no ongoing maintenance.</p>
         <p>The Professional Course was a two-year course designed for women who already had four
            years of high school, those who had completed the Preparatory Course, or who had already
            received a professional certificate. By 1915, students enrolled in the Professional
            Course had the option of pursuing specialized certification in Kindergarten and Primary
            grades, Intermediate and Grammar grades, or High School. A student that completed one
            year of the Professional Course received a Junior State Normal Certificate, or the
            Professional Certificate. Those who completed the two-year Professional Course received
            a Full Normal diploma.</p>
         <p>Various other programs, namely Household Arts Program (later named Home Economics
            Course), Manual Arts, Industrial Arts Course, Kindergarten Training, among others, were
            offered in the early years, though enrollment was quite small relative to the Regular
            and Professional Courses. </p>
         <p>The Harrisonburg Summer Session, which started in 1910, was designed to appeal to those
            already in teaching positions. In 1911, the State Board of Education authorized the
            Normal School to issue a Summer School Professional Certificate â one for primary school
            and one for grammar grades â awarded to students who completed courses in the two
            six-week summer terms in two separate years. The Summer Professional Certificate was
            considered more advanced than the First Grade Certificate. By 1916, the certificate
            requirements increased to three six-week terms over three separate summers, and in 1918
            it was replaced by the Elementary Professional Certificate, which required still more
            study. A unique feature of the Harrisonburg Summer Sessions was that enrollment was also
            open to men. </p>
         <p>In 1918, the State Normal School began to offer four year Bachelor programs in Home
            Economics and Elementary teaching. In 1934 the school officially became a liberal arts
            institution, able to issue Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in
            Education.</p>
