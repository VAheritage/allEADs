      <head>Biographical Information </head>
      <p>The Shenandoah Valley, located between the Blue Ridge and Appalachian Mountains, has
                had a rich history. While the Civil War is the most nationally prominent event to
                occur in the Valley, the Shenandoah Local History Collection provides insight into
                daily life within this area during the nineteenth century. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>The Shenandoah Local History Collection, 1791-1900, consists of a canvas bag, a loan
                from the Confederate States of America, one unissued stock for the Newmarket and
                Sperryville Turnpike Company, two floral albums, four land grants, five photographs
                of Bridgewater, VA, Minutes of Quarterly Conferences for Rockingham Circuit Begun at
                a Camp Meeting of the United Methodist Church, Harrisonburg, the account book and
                accompanying papers of Robert Grattan, and the Chew Collection. </p>
      <p>Series I contains a canvas bag circa, perhaps a printer's bag or an educational tool.
                This bag has 22 pouches sewn onto a rectangular piece of fabric. Each pouch has one
                or more letters printed on it. There is some ink staining on the bag.</p>
      <p>Series II contains a loan from the Confederate States of America valued at $1000
                issued on February 20, 1865. It was printed in Richmond, Virginia by Archer and Daly
                and has seven coupons, each worth $35 for six months interest, attached to the
                bottom of the bond. </p>
      <p> Series III contains an unissued stock for the Newmarket and Sperryville Turnpike
                Company. This company was incorporated by the Virginia Legislature in 1848. Its
                modern alignment is U.S. Route 11 and is also known as Lee Highway. The stock itself
                was engraved by the firm Rawdon, Wright, Hatch and Edison from New-York which was
                one of the most prominent engraving firms in nineteenth century America.</p>
      <p> Series IV consists of two floral albums. Such albums became popular in America
                during the nineteenth century and were designed so that friends and family members
                could inscribe blank pages with drawings, poems, prayers, or letters dedicated to
                the albums owner. The first album is dedicated to Miss Sarah Ann Cornelia Maupin
                spanning a period of time from 1850 through 1860. In 1852 she married David Gwin
                McClung and the dedications of each entry change from “To Miss Sarah A.C. Maupin” to
                “Miss Sarah A.C. McClung.” The second album was dedicated to Miss Mary Jane O’Brian
                on Feb. 3, 1856 and runs through 1880. Her last name is sometimes spelled as
                “O’Bryan” and she is sometimes referred to as Mollie.</p>
      <p> Series V is a collection of four land grants that confer land within Rockingham
                county to four separate individuals. The oldest deed lists Frederick Fraley as the
                recipient of land and it is dated 1791. The next deeds are for John Hite in 1798,
                Henry Bolton in 1835, and James Bolton in 1846.</p>
      <p> Series VI holds five black and white photographs of Bridgewater, Virginia. These
                images show an old woolen mill, fields with the town behind them, two men in a
                carriage by the river, the river with fields and the town on either side, and one
                unidentified photo of a street in winter. They were identified in 1985 by local
                historian C. E. May.</p>
      <p>Series VII is made up of xeroxed copies of the “Minutes of Quarterly Conferences for
                Rockingham Circuit Begun at a Camp Meeting” of the United Methodist Church in
                Harrisonburg. It is dated 1815 August 25-29 although the minutes run through 1822
                September 30. Some of the recurring names in this document are Peachey Harrison,
                Reuben Harrison, Joseph Thornton, and William Cravens. Their business deals with
                establishing locations for more camp meetings and they spend a good deal of time
                talking about slavery and emancipation. There is a treatise on slavery on beginning
                on page 35-37. Pages 51-52, 55-56 are missing. </p>
      <p>Series VIII contains xeroxed copies of a letter dated February 16, 1857 from Lizzie
                to Willie, several receipts of work and sale, as well as some newspaper clippings.
                The largest portion of this series is a xeroxed copy of Robert Grattan’s account
                book which was begun in April 1798 and has entries through 1817. </p>
      <p> Series IX encompasses xeroxed copies of the Chew Collection from Waynesboro, VA. All
                of the papers relate to William Morgan Chew who was a prominent grocer in
                Waynesboro, VA. The collection contains many business letters, bills and receipts.
                It also has many documents referring to his membership in the Knights of Honor.
                There are also several letters from a Presbyterian minister Rev. Fleming to William
                Chew repeatedly declining a pastoral position. </p>
