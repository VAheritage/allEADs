        <head>Processing Information</head>
        <p>The maps, blueprints and paperwork did not arrive at Special Collections in any specific order.  For the purpose of organization the maps have been placed in chronological order based on the year that is listed on the maps.  Paperwork is also organized chronologically where dates are found.  Some maps and paperwork do not have dates listed and have been categorized as "Unknown Date."  These items are not placed in any particular order.  Some minimal preservation has been conducted on some of the maps to insure the content of the maps is maintained.  Many of the maps were received rolled up and for the purpose of storage have been flattened with humidification and weight</p>

      <head>Biographical Information </head>
      <p>Harrisonburg became a city in 1779 after Thomas Harrison deeded two and a half acres of his property to Rockingham County for the purpose of building a courthouse.  In 1780 the Harrison family gave another 50 acres to the City of Harrisonburg which became Rockingham County's county seat.  In 1780 the city limits spanned from Federal Street in the East to West High Street in the West and Bruce Street in the South to Wolfe Street in the North.</p>
      <p>In 1849 a new charter for the City of Harrisonburg established a mayor and council government whereas before a group of trustees had run the city.  In 1892 1,082 acres were annexed to the City of Harrisonburg which caused the city's population to increase three times the amount it had been prior to the addition. In 1893 a public school system was formed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction and a group of trustees elected by the town.</p>
      <p>Harrisonburg became an incorporated independent city in 1916.  Growth to the city came in the form of new land annexations in the years 1937, 1938, and 1950 which added around 320 acres of land to the city limits.  A few smaller annexations of land in the years 1965 and 1970 increased the City of Harrisonburg's acreage to 3,828 acres.  The most recent annexation to the City of Harrisonburg occurred in 1982 making the city limits total around 11,132 acres.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>The City of Harrisonburg Historic Maps Collection, 1867 - 1973, consists of 381 items stored in twenty-two map folders and one Rolled Storage box.  Most of the maps and corresponding documents fit within the years of 1903 to 1959 but there is one map from 1867 and one map from 1973.  The collection consists of mostly blueprints created by the city regarding street expansions, sewer lines and treatment plans, plans for bridge construction, street grades, sub-division additions to the city and property exchanges.  Half of the property exchanges are between private citizens and the City of Harrisonburg while the other half of the property exchanges are between private citizens only.  These items are duplicates of maps found at the Department of Community and Development for the City of Harrisonburg, Virginia.</p>
