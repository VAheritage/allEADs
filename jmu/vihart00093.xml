            <p>The scrapbook was cleaned and remains intact. Preservation recommends that
               dismantling and contents migration be considered for long-term storage due to the
               inherent instability of the materials. The scrapbook exhibits some losses from light
               and insect activity, most likely moth damage to the wool felts.</p>
            <p>In order to streamline the process of applying collection numbers, Special
               Collections staff completed a large-scale renumbering campaign in 2017-2018. <emph

         <p>Alice Virginia "Ginnie" Kellam from Cheriton, Virginia in Northampton County is listed
            as a sophomore in the 1924 <emph render="italic">Schoolma'am</emph> and in the junior
            class roll in the 1925 <emph render="italic">Schoolma'am</emph>. The June 1925
            Commencement program lists her as graduating from the "Professional Courses." Miss
            Kellam was a member of the Alpha Literary Society, the Choral Club, the Racquet Tennis
            Club, the Athletic Association, and the YWCA. Her inscription in the yearbook reads, "Of
            softest manner, unaffected mind, Lover of peace, and friend of humankind." Miss Kellam
            was the daughter of Mr. Clyde Kellam, also of Cheriton, Virginia.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Alice Virginia Kellam Scrapbook, 1923-1925, consists of one 8 3/4" x 15" x 2 1/2"
            scrapbook requiring 2.63 linear inches of storage space. The scrapbook is purple felt
            with orange script lettering "Memories" and an "HTC" (Harrisonburg Teacher's College)
            insignia stitched in orange felt and bound together with purple cotton cord. Contents of
            the scrapbook are mounted on black paper pages and consist of cards and letters from
            friends and family, newspaper clippings, class schedules, Constitution and By-laws of
            the Student Association, and the Student Handbook from 1923-1924.</p>
         <p>Of particular interest to education students might be Miss Kellam's Training School
            Criticism Book with numerous entries from her professors critiquing her student teaching
            abilities. Also unique to the collection is a small address book which served multiple
            purposes as address book and daily log with such entries as "Fun at large." The small
            booklet also features a code deciphering section presumably for passing notes during
            class of which there are examples in the scrapbook. Ephemera within the scrapbook are
            flora, party favors and ribbons, candy wrappers and cigarettes, locks of hair presumably
            from the "bob" craze, as well as tickets and programs to campus and local events. A
            substantial program entitled "Trail Riders of the Rockies" by Colonel Philip A. Moore is
            also present. Also of local historical interest are several postcards of downtown
            Harrisonburg including the Kavanaugh Hotel, the B&amp;O Railroad Station, and general
            views of the city.</p>
