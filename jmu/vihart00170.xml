      <p>Barbara White was a resident and socialite of Salem, Massachusetts. She was the daughter of
        a local judge and according to a telegram within this collection, was known personally by
        Vice President Calvin Coolidge. Barbara White attended Smith College in Northampton,
        Massachusetts. She is pictured with the Class of 1920 in the Smith College yearbook from
        that year.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Barbara White Tour Diary, 1921-1922, is comprised of a 6¾ x 8¼ manuscript diary with
        approximately 72 written pages. A stationer’s label on the front cover reads “ Bob’s Journal
        Volume I.” Barbara White kept this diary while traveling aboard the Cunard Liner RMS <emph
          render="italic">Albania</emph> to Europe. The diary begins with a November 3, 1921 entry
        (“First night out. Nice clean boat.”) and continues through at least January 3, 1922.
        White’s entries are observant and lighthearted, containing humorous accounts (with pen and
        pencil drawings throughout) of her fellow passengers and ship captain. White encounters a
        gentleman by the name of Chadwick whom she describes as an “old dumbbell” who “talked all
        the time about his travels in America, where he had been for a whole two weeks.” She also
        details activities aboard the ship and writes at length about her travels, arrivals, and
        departures throughout England, France, Switzerland, and Italy. White mounted souvenirs and
        keepsakes throughout the pages, including a card game scorecard, a “Programme of
        Entertainment” folder from Armistice Day, a telegram sent to her the day before she sailed,
        her handwritten itinerary while in England, two ship-to-shore telegrams from Radio <emph
          render="italic">Albania</emph>, one telephone calling card, a ticket from the London
        General Omnibus Co., bills and receipts, including one restaurant bill, one bakery bill, and
        one hotel bill with five Italian stamps. Also mounted are European postcards, original
        photographs, one theatrical photograph card, and other small souvenirs. </p>
      <p>Also in the collection are two telegrams dated prior to Barbara White’s departure,
        addressing the issuance of her passport. One telegram, dated August 7, 1921, is a copy from
        Vice President Calvin Coolidge to Secretary of State Charles E. Hughes requesting White’s
        passport be issued at once. White was “personally well known” to Coolidge and considered her
        “in every way entitled to passport.” The second, dated September 8, 1921, is a reply Hughes
        to Coolidge stating that the passport would be issued and mailed on September 8, 1921. </p>
      <p>Two pages in the diary have exposed adhesive from where once mounted keepsakes were either
        removed or have fallen from the diary. Several loose souvenirs have been removed from the
        pages and placed within envelopes in a separate folder including a telegram addressed to
        White from Sylvia, presumably a friend. This telegram is dated November 2, 1921 – the day
        before White’s departure. Additional loose items include three photographs and a Banca
        Commerciale Italiana ticket souvenir. </p>
