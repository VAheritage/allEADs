         <head>Admin History</head>
         <p>Theatre at James Madison University was initially an extracurricular activity, with the Stratford Players serving as the most popular student drama club. In 1966, the Department of Speech and Drama was established and in the following year, 1967, the Latimer-Shaeffer Theatre opened in the Duke Fine Arts Center (now Duke Hall). The theatre was named after former theatre director and Stratford Players advisor, Mary Latimer Cordner and former music faculty Edna T. Shaeffer. In 1973, Thomas H. Arthur was hired at Madison College to transform the theatre program from an extracurricular activity into a college department. Arthur soon hired Allen Lyndrup, Thomas L. King, Pam Johnson, Phil S. Grayson and Roger Hall as faculty members. Arthur and King worked together to construct and establish the Wampler Experimental Theatre, also known as Theatre II, in 1974, which gave a home to productions written and directed by students.</p>
         <p>In 1977 King, Arthur, and Grayson requested permission to develop a new theatre program in addition to Theatre II. Through a partnership with Food Service, the Dinner Theatre was established in Gibbons Hall to provide summer patrons with a buffet followed by a play featuring students and professional performers. The Dinner Theatre soon became a popular summer activity in Harrisonburg, drawing theatre-goers from around Virginia. The Dinner Theatre also provided prospective students and families, along with summer session students, with summer entertainment. In 1978 the Dinner Theatre sent a troupe to Italy and Germany to perform for the USO and by its second season the program became fully professional, welcoming JMU faculty, staff, students, and non-JMU personnel to contribute to the Dinner Theatre. According to Arthur, "[The Dinner Theatre] was very important to the growth of theater and dance [at JMU] because it gave us greater visibility." The Dinner Theatre ultimately ran for 17 years, ending in 1993.</p>
         <p>In 1986, the Department of Theatre and Dance was formed in the College of Fine Arts, now the College of Arts and Letters. It remained in the College until 2015 when the establishment of the College of Visual and Performing Arts was approved. Today, the School of Theatre and Dance focuses on training and educating artists, scholars, and teachers in the traditions and current practices of dance, theatre, and musical theatre. The School puts on around thirty performances a year, including four theatre and three dance productions during their main stage season.</p>
