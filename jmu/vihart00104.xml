<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Hedrick Family Collection, 1870-1959, consists of 1/2 Hollinger Box (.209 linear ft.) of items separated into four different series:  Legal Documents, Financial Documents, Miscellaneous, and Digitized Material.</p>
<p>Legal Documents, 1870-1933, consists of two folders.  The majority of material in the first folder includes a large number of summonses addressed to George W. Hedrick to appear before Rockingham County Court.  The second folder includes documents pertaining to tax and tax collection.  Some examples include receipts for paid taxes from both Rockingham County and the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Of particular interest is a signed letter from former governor Harry Flood Byrd to Mr. Hedrick discussing new tax policy in 1927.</p>
<p>Financial Documents, 1874-1959, also consists of two folders.  Personal financial documents include bank notes from Rockingham Bank and the First National Bank of Harrisonburg, promissory notes involving the harvesting of wheat crops,  and a document regarding the Stonewall Road Board in 1900 that itemizes equipment and labor costs to be reimbursed to James C. Hedrick.  Receipts from locations such as the Wetzel Seed Company, the United Wool Grower's Association, Shenandoah Valley Livestock Sales, and the Rockingham Petroleum Cooperative are also represented.  </p>
<p>Correspondence, 1856-1943, consists of letters and envelopes, several of which contain unique stamps and cancellations.  Most of the correspondence in this series is personal and usually between cousins, brothers, sisters, and friends.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous, 1892-1922, consists of three publications and handwritten documents describing the establishment of a Reform Church of McGaheysville, campaign business cards for the office of Commissioner of the Revenue for Plains District, and a certificate of promotion for James Hedrick from "B" class to "A" class of second grade from 1905.  One of the church publications is an abstract of acts and proceedings of the Reformed Church in the United States published by the Quenzel Printing House in Martinsburg, W.Va. in 1892.  The other two items are 1919 and 1922 annual reports of the Reformed Church of the U.S., representing St. Michael's Frieden's, Brown Memorial, and Island Ford Churches.</p>
<p>Digitized Material, 1857-1932, consists of a variety of items of which the originals were returned to the donor.  Two accounting books belonging to C.L. Hedrick and George W. Hedrick, as well as a list of wedding gifts for Mr. and Mrs. John H. Sipe were scanned and returned to the donor.  The "Miscellaneous" digitized items in this collection also have been photocopied and these copies are in the collection, including 19th Century letters and envelopes, a 1889 promissory note from George W. Hedrick to Abner Shacklett for $210.00, and a 1932 "Get Well Soon" card from Maud R. Lemley to Mrs. Annie Hedrick.  Newspaper clippings from the Twin City Sentinel in Winston-Salem, NC regarding Pastor Dr. W. H. Causey are also included.</p>
