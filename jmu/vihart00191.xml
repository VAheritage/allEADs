      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Nathan Leigh Jones (1907-1989), a native of Smithfield, Virginia, served the Commonwealth
        of Virginia for more than five decades with the Department of Highways and Transportation.
        Jones began his career in 1923 as a member of a road construction crew in the Suffolk
        District. In 1928, he was promoted to a mechanic in the Suffolk shop. After marrying Della
        Marion Stidley in 1937, Jones was assigned to the Staunton District where he dedicated the
        remainder of his professional career. The only interruption to Jones' service with the
        Department of Highways and Transportation came in 1942 when he joined the Army; he served
        for three years. Jones retired in 1974, after 51 years of service, as district highway
        equipment superintendent.</p>
