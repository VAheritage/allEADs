<head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
<p>The award, which later became the Cross of Military Service, originated on October 13, 1862 as an act of the Confederate Congress to recognize the courage, valor, and good conduct of officers, non- commissioned
officers and privates of the Confederate Army. However, due to wartime shortages the medals were unable to be made, but the recipients' names were recorded in an Honor Roll for future reference. The design of the
cross used by the UDC was created by Mrs. Alexander S. Erwin in July 1898. It featured a cross with a Confederate battle flag on the face surrounded by a laurel wreath with the inscription "The Southern Cross of
Honor." The motto of the Confederate States of America, DEO VINDICE (God Our Vindicator) 1861-1865, and the inscription "From the U.D.C. to the U.C.V." appear on the reverse side. The Southern Cross of Honor and
the Cross of Military Service are the two most prestigious honors awarded by the U.D.C.
