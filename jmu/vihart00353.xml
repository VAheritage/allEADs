         <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
         <p>Dorothy McKinley Spooner Garber, daughter of George Hansford Spooner and Prudence Sangstone Allen Spooner, was born March 4, 1897. Garber graduated from the State Normal School for Women (now James Madison University) in 1920 with her post-graduate degree. While at the State Normal School, Garber was an active member of the student body, serving as president of Student Government, her Degree and Post-Graduate Classes, Stratford Literary Society, and Junior Red Cross. Additionally, Garber was a member of YWCA, the Ministers' Daughters Club, Basketball Team, Home Economics Club, Tidewater Club, Glee Club, and Racket Tennis Club. She married Harry Emerson Garber (1898-1939) on September 1, 1925. Her father George officiated the ceremony.</p>
         <p>Garber began her career in education in 1920 as a science teacher at Woodrow Wilson High School in Portsmouth, Virginia. In 1922, she became science supervisor for the Junior High School in Harrisonburg and also taught chemistry at Harrisonburg High School. Garber returned to the State Teachers College at Harrisonburg in a professional capacity in 1925 as Instructor and Assistant Professor of science. In 1930, she became a field representative and in that capacity visited Virginia high schools to promote the State Teachers College. Between 1939 and 1941, Garber worked as a commissioned agent for the Continental Oil Company of Harrisonburg. She returned to Madison College in 1941 and became Dean of Freshman Women. Garber was promoted to Dean of Women in 1960. In addition to these positions, Garber served as Alumnae Secretary from 1922 to 1952. Beyond her myriad roles at Madison College, Garber was a member of Asbury United Methodist Church, where she sang in the choir and taught Sunday School, and the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She retired from Madison College in 1967. Garber Hall, a dormitory located in the Village Area of JMU's campus, was completed in 1969 and named after Dorothy Garber. Garber died May 21, 1978 and is buried at Woodbine Cemetery in Harrisonburg.</p>
