<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>John Edwin Roller (1844-1918), born near Mt. Crawford, was a prominent lawyer, lecturer, and antiquarian in the Shenandoah Valley.  He served in the Confederate Army, and in 1872 became major-general of the 3rd Division of the Virginia Militia.  A graduate of Virginia Military Institute and University of Virginia Law School, Roller was the first non-Pennsylvanian president of the Pennsylvania German Society (1909-1910).  Roller also served four sessions in the Virginia State Senate and was the first president of the Harrisonburg-Rockingham Historical Society.  He pursued interests in local and religious history, ammassing a considerable collection of books and papers.  Most of these items were dispersed, however, during the course of the twentieth century.
</p>
<p>The donor, Margaret Grattan Weaver (1905-2001), was a member of two of the most distinguished families in Rockingham County, the Rollers and the Grattans.  She was known throughout the Shenandoah Valley for her involvement in civic, historic, and religious organizations including the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Harrisonburg-Rockingham Historical Society, and the Margaret Grattan Weaver Foundation, which she founded in 1997.  The foundation supports and promotes preservation and appreciation of the history and religious heritage of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County.  She was also dedicated to writing poetry and essays on suffering and death, some of which are included in this collection.
