      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The New Virginia Theatre was owned by Warner Bros. Circuit Management Corporation, and
        opened sometime around the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. It was originally
        built as an old opera house and was complete with a performance stage, balcony, and private
        box seats. During the early twentieth century, the New Virginia Theater hosted many
        different stage plays and musical acts. By the year 1950, the name was changed to the
        Virginia Theater and it was converted into a movie theater. The theater eventually fell into
        disrepair, and was closed around 1986 and later torn down. During its lifetime, the theater
        was one of the many favorite Harrisonburg attractions, and was enjoyed by both Harrisonburg
        residents and Madison College students alike.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Virginia Theatre &amp; New Virginia Theatre Playbills, 1914-1924, are comprised of nine
        playbills (one folder) of the Virginia Theatre and New Virginia Theatre in Harrisonburg, VA,
        1914-24 and undated. The largest size is 15" x 6". Each gives the title of the program
        (several specify vaudeville and minstrels), actors, and producers. Many of the playbills
        also include advertising by local establishments, especially W.E. Friddle's Restaurant. Most
        of the playbills are for plays that were performed by the theater. Two of the playbills are
        for concerts given by musical acts: The Lasses White All-Star Minstrels and John W. Vogel's
        Big City Minstrels.</p>
