After becoming assistant professor of chemistry at Fort Hays State College in Kansas, where he taught from 1935-1943, Dr. Chappell joined the faculty at Madison College where he served as chair of the chemistry department until 1971.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The J. Wilbert and Ellen A. Chappell Collection, 1946-1978, consists of three folders of congratulatory letters, Faculty Wives Sewing Circle programs, photographs, and miscellany.
</p>
<p>The collection is comprised primarily of congratulatory letters addressed to Dr. Chappell in celebration of his retirement in 1975.  The letters, originally compiled in a scrapbook, were written by various members of the JMU community including faculty members and Dr. Chappell's former students.  Also present are other materials relating to Dr. Chappell's retirement such as luncheon invitations and a guest list.  Nine programs from the Faculty Wives Sewing Circle, dating from 1946 to 1958, are also included.  A folder of miscellany contains a black and white photograph of a groundbreaking ceremony with corresponding negative and enlarged print as well as other ephemera.  The identity of the photographed persons, with the exception of Dr. Chappell, is unknown.
