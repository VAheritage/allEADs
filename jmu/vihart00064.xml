            <p>The 1862-1864 diary was part of the private collection of Maxine and E.R. Grymes
               Heneberger of Harrisonburg, Virginia. Grymes Heneberger found the diary in 1960 and
               had it transcribed. He self-published a small run of copies which he offered for sale
               and distributed to local libraries.</p>
            <p>The 1879-1883 diary was part of the Harrison family estate of Harrisonburg,
               Virginia.</p>

            <head>Processing Information</head>
            <p>While the 1862-1864 diary does not include any explicit identifying information about
               the creator, contextual information confirms it was written by Mary Jordan of
               Harrisonburg, Virginia. Both December 5 entries in the diary (1862 and 1863) record
               Jordan's exact birthday and year. This corresponds to the birth year recorded in the
               1879-1883 diary. Additionally, the handwriting in present in both diaries matches as
               does the scribbling used to separate diary entries.</p>
            <p>In order to streamline the process of applying collection numbers, Special
               Collections staff completed a large-scale renumbering campaign in 2017-2018. <emph

         <p>Mary Jordan (1798-1883) lived in Harrisonburg, Virginia, with her daughter, Julia Ann
            Jordan Sprinkel, and Julia's husband, Arthur St. Clair in Harrisonburg. The Sprinkel
            family homestead was located on the corner of Main and Rock streets. The local
            African-American church and school were located in this the same section of town,
            suggesting why Jordan mentions the deaths of several local African Americans in her 1879
            diary. The 1879 diary also contains mentions of her grandaughters, "Mag" (Margaret) and
            Mary. Jordan is buried at Woodbine Cemetary in Harrisonburg.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The collection is comprised of two bound diaries kept by Mary Jordan of Harrisonburg. </p>
         <p>The first diary dates from May 9, 1862 through August 22, 1864. Jordan's entries
            describe the death of Turner Ashby ("Col. Ashby was killed this evening. Poor Ashby poor
            fellow"), the Battle of New Market and other battles of note, troop and prisoner
            movements through Harrisonburg, death and burials of local soldiers, and Union soldiers
            movements. Additional entries of note include May 7, 1863: "The Yankee's advanceing
            great excitement in Town and Country people moveing cattle and negroes and all the
            commisary stores there was never so much confusion in this place before."</p>
         <p>Names of Charles Frank Echard (1870-1941) family members are penciled in the diary and
            post-date Mary Jordan's entries. Echard was married to Maude Jordan Dillard, Mary
            Jordan's great granddaughter.</p>
         <p>The second diary dates from January 1, 1879 until October 1879, and also includes
            scattered entries through 1883. The diary entries are brief and record the weather,
            daily activities such as church attendance, visits from relatives and friends, travel of
            relatives to Baltimore, and getting loads of wood and barrels of flour. Occasional items
            of local news are also mentioned, such as court dates, trials, births, marriages, and
            deaths, including the deaths of several African Americans living in Harrisonburg in 1879
            ("Sunday January the 26th 1879 A coulered woman buried this evening").</p>
         <p>On the first page is written: "Mary Jordan born in 17 hundred and 98 and this is 1879 I
            am still here." Family names mentioned in the diary include Sprinkel, Dillard, Bowman,
            Rohr, Wilton, and Dwyer, among others.</p>
