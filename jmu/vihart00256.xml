      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Superintendent of the hotel, P.H. (Peter Hanger) Woodward was born in 1823 near Willow
        Spout, and spent most of his life in Augusta County, Virginia. During his employment at the
        hotel, he also served as a Captain and Quartermaster for the Confederate cause, eventually
        rising to the rank of Major. On December 6, 1861 the <emph render="italic">Rockingham
          Register</emph> refers to complaints made by area farmers of the Woodward's demands for
        teams of horses to carry supplies to the armies in the mountains in the northwestern
        Virginia: "We assure our readers that we have taken some pains to enquire into the subject,
        and are satisfied that Cap. Woodward is only doing what the most urgent necessities of the
        case require."</p>
      <p> The Exchange Hotel was found on "Bank Row" in Harrisonburg, and a Medical Notice in the
          <emph render="italic">Rockingham Register</emph> states it was located "immediately on the
        right [of the Exchange Bank], in the house recently occupied by B.F. Marz, dec'd." It is
        inferred by this document that it opened some time in 1860.</p>
      <p>The proprietor of the Exchange Hotel, Dr. William Williams (1820-1888), maintained a
        general practice at the rooms in the hotel. According to several Medical Notices in the
          <emph render="italic">Rockingham Register and Advertiser</emph>, Dr. Williams practiced
        with Dr. Gordon, and P.H. Woodward, in that in addition to his hotel duties, Woodward took
        messages for their office. </p>
      <p>According to the Rockingham Register, on April 19, 1861, a large secession flag was raised
        "by an enthusiastic crowd" at the Exchange Hotel in honor of the surrender of Fort Sumpter.
        Valley Guards were on parade and "fired 100 guns." Later that year, on December 6, 1861,
        Brig. General Arnold Elzey put a notice in the <emph render="italic">Rockingham
          Register</emph>, ordering absentees from the 10th Regiment, Va. Volunteers to report to
        their regiment at the Exchange Hotel, on penalty of arrest and charge of treason. That same
        day, the <emph render="italic">Rockingham Register</emph> stated that the Exchange Hotel
        "table supplied, even in these times of scarcity and dearness of provisions, with a
        superabundance of the very best living the country can afford."</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>In this letter, written by P.H. Woodward to Mr. Lary on Exchange Hotel of Harrisonburg
        stationery, Woodward apologizes for the fact that he is unable to pick Lary up in Staunton.
        Woodward writes that he has been "as busy as a bee the last 25 days and nights," "confined
        to the house day and night," and "run all most [sic] to death."</p>
      <p>The letter contains an advertisement for the newly opened Exchange Hotel, describing a
        table, "provided with every comfort and delicacy that can be procured" a bar with "superior
        liquors and segars [sic]" and stables for horses. The advertisement is dated December 21,
        1860.</p>
