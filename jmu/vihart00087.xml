        <p>This collection was minimally reprocessed in April 2017 and renamed Manley Family Papers,
          a change from the George W. Manley Collection. In order to streamline the process of
          applying collection numbers, Special Collections staff completed a large-scale renumbering
          campaign in the spring of 2017. <emph render="bold">This collection was previously
            cataloged as SC 2010.</emph></p>

      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>George W. Manley was descended from a prominent family which owned property near George
        Washington's Mount Vernon and intermarried with the Washington and Harrison families. The
        collection also contains letters to Hugh W. Sheffey, who was the Augusta County
        representative to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850 and to the Virginia General
        Assembly in 1850s and 1860s.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>George W. Manley Collection, 1707-1953, contains about 300 items housed in one legal-sized
        Hollinger box and one oversized box. The collection is composed largely of two kinds of
        materials: personal, business, and genealogical papers relating to the Manley family of
        Augusta County, Virginia and Marion County, formerly of Virginia and later West Virginia;
        and miscellaneous business and legal papers not directly related to the Manleys that
        document the functioning of law and government in what is now Franklin County, West
        Virginia, and Augusta County, Virginia, with scattered references to other Virginia counties
        and Marion County, West Virginia. The collection is arranged topically and then
        chronologically into seven series: Correspondence, 1774-1953; Business &amp; Legal
        Documents, 1707-1909; Family Memorobilia and Genealogical Notes, 1870-c. 1940s; Civil War
        Papers, 1861-1867; Native American Data, c.1932 and n.d., and Miscellaneous Virginia
        History, c.1900s, n.d.</p>
      <p>Series 1, Correspondence, 1774-1953, includes general correspondence, 1774-1953, comprised
        of Manley family letters, which are genealogical in nature and discuss family connections
        with the Righter family of West Virginia, the Bigler family, and family land transactions.
        Eight photographs of family members from Percy Manley's Aunt Jessie in DuPont, Washington,
        c.1950s, are also included. Also notable in the collection is a 1933 letter from Percy C.
        Manley (George's father) to Lauretta K. Muir, an official in the Civil Works Administration,
        concerning a self-sufficiency homestead project for the poor of Mineral County, West
        Virginia. Also interesting are a 1774 character reference for a member of Cedar Creek
        Congregation, a 1777 letter from John Lowning (likely a Revolutionary War soldier), and
        other letters that offer glimpses of 19th Century life, mostly in Virginia.</p>
      <p>Additionally, ten letters written to Hugh W. Sheffey, Augusta County representative to the
        Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850 and to the Virginia General Assembly in 1850s and
        1860s are included. The relationship between Sheffey and Manley is unclear, but the
        correspondence is foldered separately due to Sheffey's political position. The transcript of
        a letter written to Sheffey by Kenton Harper, dated December 16, 1846, is also available in
        the collection. It is available <extref xlink:type="simple" xlink:actuate="onRequest"

      <p>Series 2, Business and Legal Documents, 1707-1909, compromises the bulk of the collection
        and includes general documents, court case documents, deeds and indentures, and tax papers.
        Many of the documents originated in Franklin County, in the late 18th and early 19th
        centuries; some materials are from other Virginia counties, particularly Marion County. The
        dominant concerns are land and debt.</p>
      <p>Series 2, Business and Legal Documents, 1707-1909, compromises the bulk of the collection

        Many of the documents originated in Franklin County, in the late 18th and early 19th
        centuries; some materials are from other Virginia counties, particularly Marion County. The
        dominant concerns are land and debt.</p>
      <p>Court case documents contain judgements, summonses, depositions, complaints, lawsuits,
        etc., pertaining to Franklin, Augusta, and Marion Counties, 1707-1855. Several summonses
        carry the note: "kept off by force of arms." Materials include two statements by unwed
        mothers naming the fathers and declaring need for financial assistance from them (1804,
        1805); one summons for illegal slavery (1805); two orders to pay court witnesses (1840); a
        1786 Augusta County seal; and several complaints of assault.</p>
      <p>The deeds and indentures consist of numerous deeds from Marion County relevant to the
        Manley and Righter family. Other deeds pertain to Franklin County, with a few from Augusta,
        Shenandoah, and Hardy Counties. An 1834 land plat dividing Henry Gochenour's land in Hardy
        County is also present. Materials that are oversized and housed seperatly include materials
        such as a 1774 indenture of John Haynes of Bedford County for sale of slaves to William
        McDonald, deeds and indentures relating to the Saunders family of Franklin County, deeds
        granting land in Augusta County to John Archer, signed by Lord Dinwiddie (1759), to Gabriel
        Fox of Hampshire County, England, signed by Lord Fairfax (1780), an 1847 indenture
        documenting the sale of land in Illinois from Carlos Enos to William Tams, as well as deeds
        relevant to the Manley Family.</p>
      <p>Tax papers include an 1812 list of lands not found in Franklin County after division of the
        county in 1786, and 1856-1862 Manley family receipts for personal and property taxes in
        Marion County.</p>
      <p>Series 3, Family Memorabilia and Genealogical Notes, 1870-1940, consists of three folders
        relating to the Manley family, including poetry of P.C. Manley and typed excerpts ostensibly
        from George Washington's diary mentioning Harrison Manley; family memorabilia such as
        documents and certificates and two small publications, entitled "The Naval Career of Captain
        John Manley of Marblehead" (1909) and "Hand Book of Pohick Church" (undated. with postcard;
        Fairfax County); and twelve photographs, seven of which are identified as various Manley
        family members and taken by various photographers from Fairmont, West Virginia.</p>
      <p>Series 4, Civil War Papers, 1861-1867, consists of a small number of materials related to
        the Civil War. Documents include an 1863 C.S.A. mail contract, two reports of deserters,
        documents relating to Peter Righter, including documentation regarding his Presidential
        pardon (the pardon, which is signed by Andrew Johnson is housed with the oversized
        materials). Also included are two unsigned, undated notes that may have been from
        Confederate spies. When the collection was originally recieved in Special Collections, it
        included an envelope labled "Trial and hanging of John Righter, Confederate Spy," the
        envelope was empty, and nothing concerning John Righter was found in the collection.</p>
      <p>Series 5, Native American Data, c.1932 and n.d., documents a 1932 excavation of an Indian
        Mound near Lewis Creek in Augusta County, Virginia, including an anonymous typescript
        describing the excavation, photocopied newspaper clippings, photocopied drawings of relics,
        and transcript from Augusta County Deed Book No. 22. Six photopraphs of the excavation are
        housed here also. A undated oversized map entititled "Indian Tribes of North America," and
        compiled by Driver, Cooper, Kirchhoff, Libby, Massey, and Spier is housed seperately.</p>
      <p>Series 6, Miscellaneous Virginia History, c. 1900s and n.d., consists of two folders of
        material: documents and images. Documents include anonymous notes regarding the Beverley
        Patent, copies of newspaper clippings regarding stage coaches, and notes regarding stage
        lines and businesses along stage line routes in Virginia in the 1800s. (An 1870 broadside
        advertising the sale of stage coach horses in Bath County is housed with oversized
        materials.) The Images folder includes one poor-quality engraving of the Hotel Altemonte in
        Staunton, Virginia likely removed from a publication. Also included are eleven postcards of
        various scenes and structures in Harpers Ferry and Charles Town, West Virginia, particularly
        of sites relating to the execution of John Brown, the abolitionist who led an unsuccesful
        slave rebellion at Harpers Ferry in 1859.</p>
      <p>Series 7, Oversize Materials, 1723-1870 and n.d., contains oversize materials from series
        listed above.</p>
