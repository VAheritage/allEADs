         <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
         <p>On 10 March 1916, the General Assembly of Virginia passed
         Chapter 146, an act foreshadowing the Eighteenth Amendment of
         1920. In this act, the General Assembly defined ardent spirits
         and went on to prohibit their manufacture, sale,
         transportation for sale, and general distribution. Further, it
         regulated the sale of alcohol for medicinal purposes by
         requiring those businesses who were allowed, by court license,
         to sell alcohol to file a monthly report, or inventory, of
         their alcohol on hand. This act was not written to prevent
         personal manufacture for consumption; it was designed to start
         Virginia on the road to temperance.</p>
         <p>Chapter 146 was strengthened on 19 March 1918 with the
         passage of Chapter 388, which required that common carriers of
         ardent spirits be required to keep their records of quantities
         transported in an alphabetical file box, which was to include
         affidavits attesting to whom the alcohol was shipped, the
         amount and kind received, the date of delivery, and the
         consignee. These records mostly comprise this collection.</p>
         <p>Both of these acts were repealed, however, with the passage
         of Chapter 403, section 54 (20 March 1920), which required
         that the clerk of the circuit court of each county keep these
         affidavits in an alphabetically arranged book and took all the
         paperwork off the hands of the transportation companies.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection is comprised almost exclusively of
         affidavits of monthly alcohol inventories in places of
         business in Rockingham County, Virginia.</p>
      </scopecontent>
      <arrangement>
         <head>Organization</head>
         <p>This collection is in one flat box, and covers the dates of
         December 1916 to July 1917. The collection was received in
         rough chronological order (by month) and alphabetically by
         consignee within each monthly record. Affidavits were
         reorganized into a series of twenty-two packets by company
         (Southern Express, Adams Express, or Wells Fargo), then by
         locale and date, and packaged in nine envelopes. There is one
         folder of notarized letters.</p>
