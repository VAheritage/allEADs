      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>On June 4th, 1919 Congress passed the 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote.
        This ledger was utilized mostly in 1922, with a few entries back-dated to 1920. This means
        that the ledger was created very shortly after the success of the women's suffrage
        movement.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This Bridgewater Women Voters Roll, 1920-1951, consists of one bound and handwritten
        ledger, 15-1/2"x10-1/2". This ledger dates from 1922-1948 with a few entries back-dated to
        1920, and one other listing 1951 as a date of transfer. The pre-printed label with
        handwritten blanks (indicated by italics) on the front of the ledger reads:</p>
      <p>Roll of Women (White) Voters Registered at Bridgewater Corp Precinct Ashby Magestrial
        District Rockingham County, Virginia, 1948 White or Colored</p>
      <p> The headings for the roll include: date of registration; number; name; date of birth; age
        in years; occupation; residence; length of residence in state, county and precinct; "Is he
        exempt from payment of poll tax as a prerequisite to voting?"; If naturalized, date of
        papers and by what court issued; if transferred, when and to what precinct. The earliest
        registrants listed are Frances Arey and Jessie Beydler in January 1922. The earliest birth
        date listed is Martha Diehl, who was born 1861. Occupations are varied from predominantly
        house-wives and house-keepers, to teachers, book keepers, secretaries, stenographers,
        nurses, students, clerks and seamstresses. The more unusual occupations listed are: Dean of
        Women, Assistant Post Master, dietician, and dental assistant. Almost all of the registrants
        are local, or were transferred from a neighboring precinct. All entries are handwritten in
        blue ink. </p>
