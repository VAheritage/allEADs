      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>John Alonzo Frenger (1847-1922) lived in Greenville in Augusta County, Virginia. Frenger
        married Severine Bell Muse (1849-1904) and together they had three children, Robert Muse
        (1872-1948), Mary, and Odessa. He was a farmer by trade who recorded daily diary entries as
        well as financial accounts in this account book.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The John A. Frenger Diary and Account Book, 1880-1892, bulk 1881-1884, consists of one ledger of
        180 pages and two loose newspaper clippings. The ledger documents household and farm
        expenses and also includes periodic diary entries (generally written on a semiweekly basis).
        Various newspaper clippings are pasted to the front inside cover and flyleaf. Topics include
        home remedies and political news. Also included are two loose newspapers clippings
        concerning a death of Juette Larett and a new fencing regulation put into place in Virginia.
        These clippings have been removed from the ledger and foldered separately.</p>
      <p>The accounting portion of the ledger concerns Frenger’s household and farm expenses
        (payment of fire insurance policy, tobacco, medicine, and axle grease) and receipts for
        goods sold (produce sold at store, bacon sold, and beef sold to butcher). </p>
      <p>Frenger’s periodic entries primarily document the weather and general farm activities
        including planting, harvesting, and the overall condition of the farm. He records his church
        attendance, social visits, and travels to surrounding communities. Frenger also comments on
        local deaths and general town gossip. Many entries conclude with “No News.”</p>
      <p>Of particular interest are Frenger’s extensive accounts of the assassination attempt and
        eventual death of President James A. Garfield. He writes on July 3, 1881 of the
        assassination (attempt) of Garfield: “Special Sad News: President Garfield was Assassinated
        yesterday in Washington yesterday just as he was boarding the cars by a man by the name of
        Grottoe [sic]. Mr. Garfield is my special friend and his sad end I can hardly bear. Tears do
        Flow when I think of the Great and Good man. May God Take care of him is my Hearts desire.”
        Frenger writes on July 10, 1881, presumably after the news had reached August County, that
        President Garfield had been shot and only wounded: “I am Truly Happy to Record the fact that
        President Garfield is Improving and is likely to Recover.” However, Frenger’s August 21,
        1881 entry describes the inevitable: “President Garfield is growing Worse I fear he will
        Die.” He continues to write about President Garfield throughout September 1881 and concludes
        with a heartfelt entry on September 25: “I am Sorry beyond Expression to note the Death of
        our venerable President James Abram Garfield which occurred at Long Branch on last Monday
        night at 10:35 P.M.” Finally, Frenger mentions on July 2, 1882 that Guiteau, Garfield’s
        assassin, was hung the week prior.</p>
