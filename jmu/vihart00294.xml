         <head>Administrative History</head>
         <p>The Office of Affirmative Action at James Madison University was established in 1985. As an office, some of their responsibilities and goals included, but were not limited to:</p>
         <p>- Developing and overseeing the University's <emph render="italic">Affirmative Action Plan</emph></p>
         <p>- Publishing the <emph render="italic">Affirmative Action Newsletter</emph> sent to administrators, faculty, and black students,</p>
         <p>- Publicizing programs sponsored by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV) for minority and white juniors, black graduate students, and minority faculty.</p>
         <p>Before the Office of Affirmative Action was officially established, JMU had an Affirmative Action Officer in place to oversee minority student and faculty recruitment and make sure JMU was meeting intended targets as laid out in their <emph render="italic">Affirmative Action Plan</emph>, a plan required by Virginia state law to increase integration in schools of higher education. The idea of an Affirmative Action Officer came from the Faculty Women's Caucus.</p>
         <p>In response to the unequal balance in male and female faculty at Madison College, the Caucus established their own affirmative action committee in 1974. The committee was also created as a response to the overall lack of female faculty being appointed to higher administration positions. The committee was the Caucus' way to fully address their concerns with administration and then president, Dr. Ronald E. Carrier. In 1979, the committee recommended that the University appoint an Affirmative Action Officer that would be committed to solving problems faced by minority groups at JMU and that the Caucus' committee should serve as a resource to the appointed officer. Throughout the 1980s, the committee also recommend that it should advise the University administration and faculty concerning minority policies. Between the 1982-1984 school years, the committee recommended that a full-time Affirmative Action Officer be hired, even though Dr. John P. Mundy was serving as Affirmative Action Officer at this time. On March 15, 1984, Dr. Mundy was quoted in the University newspaper <emph render="italic">The Breeze</emph> as stating "We don't want to keep them [women] in the lower levels [of administration and job positions], but they're just not qualified to fill the higher paying positions" The article, titled "Administrator says women less qualified," discussed the pay gap between female and male faculty members. Two weeks after the article was published, the Caucus sent a letter to President Carrier expressing their anger and disappointment about Dr. Mundy's quote. This letter expressed the Caucus' belief that JMU had the potential to be a great University but had a significant amount of work to do in order to become a model for other universities. The letter highlighted these points:</p>
               <p>- The impact that Dr. Mundy's quote in the article had on student views of female faculty and the damage it caused to student-faculty relationships.</p>
               <p>- The need for a plan to sensitize all staff at JMU concerning women and minorities.</p>
         <p>In addition to highlighting certain points, the letter also ends with recommendations to Dr. Carrier about the next steps to take, including:</p>
               <p>- Officially clarifying JMU's position regarding the qualifications of female faculty.</p>
               <p>- Increasing female input concerning policies made regarding women and minorities.</p>
               <p>- Ensuring that the Affirmative Action Officer actively listened to female faculty to find creative solutions to problems rather than stereotypical excuses.</p>
               <p>- Establishing an Affirmative Action Office within the University that could pursue programs related to affirmative action for all student and faculty minorities.</p>
         <p>The most important of these recommendations was the formation of an Affirmative Action Office at JMU. As another consequence of <emph render="italic">The Breeze</emph> article, Dr. Carrier replaced Dr. Mundy as Affirmative Action Officer with Dr. Elizabeth Ihle from the College of Education. As the new officer, Dr. Ihle oversaw the establishment of the Office of Affirmative Action in 1985. Dr. Ihle is briefly mentioned as the Affirmative Action Officer in the meeting minutes of the Board of Visitors on April 11, 1987 and was promoted from an associate professor to a professor in 1987.</p>
         <p>The idea to develop an Office of Equal Opportunity was first discussed during the 1985-1986 school year. As one of their goals in 1985, the Office of Affirmative Action wanted to combine their services with those of Disability Services in order to create a streamlined office to deal with all the needs and challenges that students and faculty might come across at JMU. In 2005, the Office of Affirmative Action became the Office of Equal Opportunity.</p>
