            <p>Bill and Nora Haagenson, Daisy's neighbors in Port Washington, New York, donated the collection in December 2019. The collection was in the physical custody of Laurie Powers, Daisy Bacon's biographer and Staunton, Virginia resident, while she was writing <emph render="italic">Queen of the Pulps: The Reign of Daisy Bacon and Love Story Magazine</emph>. Powers delivered the collection to Special Collections after the Haagensons signed a deed of gift transferring ownership to JMU.</p>

            <head>Processing Information</head>
            <p>Laurie Powers, Daisy Bacon biographer, was actively referencing and using the materials in this collection prior to its transfer to Special Collections. Powers provided descriptions and date ranges for much of the material in this collection including diaries and journals. Powers also removed loose newspaper clippings, notes, and printed ephemera from diaries and arranged them according to date or subject in plastic sleeves. Said clippings and assorted ephemera have been foldered according to Powers' groupings. Any associated labels were retained and transferred to folders and sub-folders. Exceptions have been made for papers with more discrete research potential than newspaper clippings (e.g. correspondence, Daisy Bacon's cat's pedigree chart). </p>
            <p>Plastic covers were removed from three scrapbooks contaiining <emph render="italic">Love Story</emph> covers.</p>
            <p>Non-archival plastic sleeves were removed from personal papers and correspondence.</p>
            <p>The groupings of newspaper clippings are foldered and subfoldered according to their groupings when donated.</p>
            <p>The three lacquer (acetate) phonodiscs containing the June 13, 1941 radio program "The Writer and Your Life" were reformatted in-house by Kirsten Mlodynia, Digital Projects Specialist. </p>
            <p>The photograph groupings as arranged by Laurie Powers were largely retained. Exceptions include photographs used for Powers' biography that were separated based solely on their inclusion in <emph render="italic">Queen of the Pulps</emph>. Most of these photographs were interfiled with other groupings. </p>
            <p>A portion of the photo negatives are cellulose nitrate, in deteriorating condition, and/or do not have photograph copies. As such, they are likely candidates for future reformatting. The negatives were removed from their paper envelopes and housed in acid-free sleeves in those same groupings. The envelopes are retained as examples of marketing and advertisement for photo development companies.</p>

         <p>The collection is arranged into five series.</p> 

         <p>Series 1: Diaries and Journals, 1899-1982, is arranged by creator (Daisy Bacon, Jessie Bacon Ford, etc.) and item type (diaries, dream journals, etc.) which generally also follows a chronological arrangement.</p>

         <p>Series 2: Scrapbooks and Ephemera, 1903-1976, is arranged chronologically. The scrapbooks of <emph render="italic">Love Story</emph> covers are grouped together which only slightly disrupts the chronological arrangement.</p>

         <p>Series 3: Manuscripts and Publishing, 1929-1975, is arranged alphabetically according to manuscript title/folder title.</p>

         <p>Series 4: Personal Papers and Correspondence, 1857-1975, is arranged chronologically.</p>

         <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
         <p>Daisy Sarah Bacon (1898-1986) was a writer and editor of Street &amp; Smith's popular <emph render="italic">Love Story Magazine</emph> from 1928 to 1947. She was born in Union City, Pennsylvania to Jessie Holbrook Bacon (1870-1936) and Elmer Bacon (1864-1900). After her father's death on January 1, 1900, Daisy's mother married George Ford (1858-1907). Their daughter Esther Joa Ford (d. 1989) was born in 1906. Esther was Daisy's lifelong friend, confidante, associate, and colleague. The two frequently referred to each other by their respective surnames – Bacon and Ford. In July 1943, Esther married Clarke Robinson, an opera singer, WWI officer, and writer. For a time, Daisy was involved romantically with Henry Wise Miller, a stockbroker who was married to writer Alice Duer Miller. During much of her adulthood, Daisy battled depression, alcoholism, and made multiple suicide attempts.</p>
         <p>Daisy began her career at Street &amp; Smith in 1926 as the reader for the <emph render="italic">Love Story</emph> advice column. Just a few months later, she started writing short stories for the magazine. Daisy became the magazine's editor in 1928 and worked closely with her half-sister and editorial assistant Esther. At the height of its popularity, <emph render="italic">Love Story</emph>'s yearly circulation reached 600,000. In addition to <emph render="italic">Love Story</emph> and other publications, Daisy edited <emph render="italic">Real Love</emph>, <emph render="italic">Pocket Love</emph>, <emph render="italic">Detective Story Magazine</emph>, <emph render="italic">Romantic Range</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Doc Savage</emph>. The publication of <emph render="italic">Love Story</emph> ceased with its February 1947 issue though Daisy continued to work at Street &amp; Smith on other pulp titles. Daisy was fired from Street &amp; Smith in April 1949 when the company ended its publication of all pulp fiction magazines except <emph render="italic">Astounding Stories</emph>. </p>
         <p>After leaving Street &amp; Smith, Daisy moved from Manhattan to Port Washington, New York where she continued to write. In 1954, she published <emph render="italic">Love Story Writer</emph>, an instruction manual on how to write romance stories. After regaining the copyright to <emph render="italic">Love Story Writer</emph> in 1963, Bacon established Gemini Books and republished the book as a paperback under the title <emph render="italic">Love Story Editor</emph>. Her manuscript for "Love Story Diary," a Street &amp; Smith tell-all was never published and is not extant. Bacon also kept diaries and dream journals, and their contents often alluded to her personal struggles and complicated relationships.</p>
         <p>Esther and Daisy's relationship was strained after they were let go from Street &amp; Smith, but Esther moved in with Daisy after her husband Clarke's death in 1962 and the two became close again. Both Daisy and Esther were cat lovers and were frequently photographed with their feline companions. Daisy Bacon died March 25, 1986 in Port Washington.</p>
         <p>Researchers are highly encouraged to review Laurie Powers's biography of Daisy Bacon titled <emph render="italic">Queen of the Pulps: The Reign of Daisy Bacon and Love Story Magazine</emph> (2019) as this biographical note is not intended to serve as a comprehensive account of Daisy Bacon's life and career.</p>

               <p>Series 1: Diaries and Journals, 1899-1982, includes diaries kept by Jessie Holbrook Bacon Ford, Esther Joa Ford Robinson, and Daisy Bacon. Overall, the diary entries are typical in that they document weather, daily activities, visiting, and  illnesses. Jessie Bacon Ford's 1899 diary is unbound and comprises more than forty pages. In it Jessie writes about daily activities with frequent mentions of Daisy, who was an infant at the time. Jessie's diaries also include periodic mentions of having "lonely days." Daisy chronicles her work on <emph render="italic">Love Story Writier</emph> and also frequently mentions dreams. Evidence of Daisy's alleged suicide attempts and overall mental health can be found in both Esther and Daisy's diary entries. A more detailed analysis of Daisy's mental health is discussed in Laurie Powers's <emph render="italic">Queen of the Pulps</emph>. Apart from her diaries, Daisy also frequently chronicled her dreams and kept several journals in which she summarized them.</p>

               <p>Series 2: Scrapbooks and Ephemera, 1903-1976, comprises miscellaneous newspaper clippings, printed ephemera, published articles, and scrapbooks created and collected by Daisy Bacon, her sister Esther, and their mother Jessie. Some of the materials  document <emph render="italic">Love Story</emph> and Daisy's career as editor at Street &amp; Smith. Many of the clippings were removed from diaries and organized by date and/or subject by Laurie Powers while writing <emph render="italic">Queen of the Pulps</emph>. These groupings were retained and are organized within sub-folders in the larger folders of newspaper clippings. Scrapbooks of a more personal nature include poetry and astrological clippings.</p>
               <p>Of interest are four scrapbooks containing <emph render="italic">Love Story</emph> covers between 1939 and 1947. Three lacquer (acetate) phonodiscs contain a radio interview conducted by George Atmond with Daisy Bacon and Clarke Robinson on June 13, 1941 on WNYC, a public radio station in New York City. The scripted interview was part of a series titled "The Writer and Your Life" which proclaimed to create a better understanding between the audience and writers. An aluminum phonodisc is also included. It has not been reformatted and there is no corresponding label to indicate the nature of its contents.</p>

               <head>Scope and Content</head>
               <p>Series 5: Photographs and Negatives, 1883-before March 25, 1986, primarily include Daisy Bacon, Henry Wise Miller, Esther Joa Ford Robinson, Clarke Robinson, Jessie Holbrook Bacon Ford, Elmer Bacon (post-mortem), and George Ford. Photographs include professional portraits, baby pictures, casual shots, and vacation destinations. Of interest is a photograph of Henry Wise Miller with Eleanor Roosevelt at a June 1940 dinner honoring those who worked for the Finnish Relief Fund. Daisy Bacon and Henry Wise Miller would freqently take photos of each other at the same location in a style described by Laurie Powers as "twin photographs." Several examples of these pairs of photogaphs are included. Additonally, this series includes a group of photographs taken of Daisy Bacon by American photojournalist William Eugene Smith for an October 1942 article for Parade's Weekly. That issue and article can be found in Series 2: Scrapbooks and Ephemera. Daisy Bacon and Esther Joa Ford Robinson were both cat enthusiasts. Many photographs feature the sisters with cats or cats on their own. The photographs are largely undated so in many cases folder date ranges are approximate.</p>
               <p>The box of photo negatives have only been minimally reviewed and have not been digitized. A portion of the negatives are represented as photographs within this series. A date range was applied that corresponds to the earliest known photograph of Daisy Bacon (ca. 1899) and Daisy's death date (March 25, 1986).</p>
