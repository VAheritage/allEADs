      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>A.S. Lara (Aaron S. Lara) was born in 1824 and died in 1941. He was a merchant, dealing in
        basic sundries such as coffee, flour and butter, as well as tobacco, liquor and wagons. A
        letter addressed to him in "Goshenbridge, Rockbridge, VA" suggests that he did business in
        Goshen between the dates of 1857-1861. His correspondence indicate he dealt with suppliers
        and buyers in Leesburg, Craigsville, Walkers Creek, and Staunton.</p>
      <p>Goshen is located in the northwest of Rockbridge County, Virginia, at the confluence of
        Mill Creek and the Great Calfpasture River. Goshen was a stop on the Virginia Central
        Railroad, which stretched about 200 miles across the state and connecting Richmond, Virginia
        in the east and Covington, Ohio at its westernmost point. Records indicate that the Virginia
        Central Railroad transported goods for Lara to such places as Fishersville, Staunton, and
        Richmond. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection consists of letters, receipts and documents related to the business dealings
        of merchant, Aaron S. Lara, between the dates of 1856-1861. Letters reveal dealings with
        suppliers and clients in Craigsville, Walkers Creek, Leesburg and Staunton, Virginia. Of
        note is a letter from G. S. Catlett, of the Office of the Bank of the Valley in Virginia in
        Staunton, requesting "a nice lot of fresh butter…I am so confined in Bank that I have not
        time to attend the little market of this big town." A letter from James A. Walker at
        Walker's Creek, on December 12, 1858, discusses the sale of "two waggons [sic] – say some 25
        or 30 barrels" of superfine flour. A letter from J.A. Craig of Craigsville, Virginia
        discusses the sale of two carts, also includes a 1 cent Franklin stamp.</p>
      <p>The Lara papers include an 1858 bill for $10.02 from the Virginia Central Railroad
        regarding the transport of tobacco, lime, and sundries to such locations as Staunton,
        Fishersville, and Richmond. </p>
      <p>A court summons of A.S. Lara, C.M King, and John Brown reveals a debt of $159.59, with
        damages of $20. The summons is signed by Clerk of the Court, J.D. Imboden, and addressed to
        the sheriff of Augusta County. </p>
      <p>The Lara Papers contain two letters that reference enslaved people. A letter from December
        4, 1860, discusses the sale of slaves owned by a Mr. O'Dell. A letter from L.P. Catlett,
        from the Office of the Bank of the Valley in Virginia, requests to buy enslaved person,
        Petunia, from A.S. Lara "as a nurse from my little girl aged 13 months old."</p>
