      <p>Martha Elizabeth "Mattie" Fretwell Mowry (September 30, 1852 - July 16, 1924) was born to
        Franklin and Ann Catherine Fretwell in Augusta County, Virginia. Mattie married into an
        established family in Augusta County. She lived in New Hope in Augusta County with her
        husband, George Alexander Mowry, where they ran the Solitude farm. They had seven children,
        one of which died prior to 1900. George died in November 1900, leaving Martha a widow until
        her own death. According to George's obituary, he was connected with one of the large
        agricultural machine manufactories.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Mattie E. Mowry Farm Ledger, 1896-1926, that documents the Mowry farm "Solitude,"
        includes 342 pages, of which, 213 pages are blank. Ledger begins with inventory following
        expense and sales trackers including grain, livestock, animal products, labor, bills, and
        miscellaneous. Many of the items record typical farm items such as eggs and butter but also
        included are records of hired labor and miscellaneous household expenses such as a bill for
        a hotel stay in Virginia.</p>
      <p>Inside the ledger were a large number of laid in papers. They include calculations,
        personal notes, and tax statements. The papers comprise of the following companies and
        agencies: the Commonwealth of Virginia, Arm &amp; Hammer, The International Tailoring Co.,
        Augusta Farmers' Co-Operative Union, Humbert &amp; Borden, Balers and Threshers,
        Harrisonburg City Produce Exchange, W.F Fretwell, Crawford and Wilberger, Knightly Milling
        Company, and Laurel Roller Mills. There is one loose paper that pertains to Alexander Mowry.
        Some of the papers are older than the official start of the ledger in 1896.</p>
      <p>The back of the ledger includes multiple templates, tables, how-tos, rules, and remedies,
        such as facts for housekeepers and how to clean feathers. The majority of the dates used in
        the ledger are from 1896 till Mowry's death in 1924 although there are a couple of entries
        from 1925 and 1926. The creator of these entries is unknown.</p>
