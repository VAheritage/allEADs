      <head>Biographical Information </head>
      <p>The store was owned and operated by the Wittig family. Ulrich Wittig and his wife, Catherine Baughman, came to the New Market area after Siram Henkel paid for their passage in return for the Wittigs' labor. Eventually, Ulrich Wittig earned enough money to buy what is considered the Wittig Store District - a vast amount of land in Dovesville which happened to contain a store and mill. On top of owning the store, he was the first postmaster of the area until the post office was discontinued in 1866. The Wittig general store was run with the help of his seven children. It was not until 1872 that the postmaster position was reinstated due to the post office being a part of the general store. One of Ulrich’s sons, Henry Wittig, then became the postmaster. The name of Dovesville was actually changed two times before gaining the permanent name of today: Bergton, Virginia located in Rockingham County. A great deal of information is written about the family members themselves by Lewis H. Yankey - a distant relative. However, there is not much written about the store itself or what happened to it. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>The Wittig Store Ledger is comprised of a single ledger that contains the store transactions from 1886 to 1889. It provides an alphabetized client list and from there, the rest of the ledger is filled with the transactions of each individual client. The list of transactions is not alphabetized, but rather follows a chronological timeline. There is no previous or follow up ledger. It is the only series in its collection.</p>

    <arrangement encodinganalog="351">
      <head>Arrangement </head>
      <p>Within the folder, there is the ledger itself and a few loose papers. These papers contain photocopied parts of the binding that were removed and slightly damaged pages in the beginning of the ledger. </p>
      <p>The collection is arranged in 1 series:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>I: Wittig and Sons</p>
      </blockquote>
