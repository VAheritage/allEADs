      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Carrie Bishop, from Proffitt, Virginia, in Albermarle County, was a student at the State
        Normal School for Women (now James Madison University), from 1914-1918. The 1918 edition of
        the year book, Schoolma'am, describes Carrie Bishop as, "well worth listening to, whether it
        be on Burns, woman's suffrage, or law and order as not preserved in Burress Hall. No
        Discipline Troubles for Carrie B." Following graduation, she taught in Churchland,
        Virginia.</p>

    <scopecontent id="aspace_41788501c5e4188204ef5d2dcd0ad336">
      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The scrapbook, arranged by year, documents Bishop's membership in various clubs and
        societies, participation in social outings, and attendance at cultural events during her
        time as a student at the State Normal School for Women at Harrisonburg. She was a member of
        the YWCA, Lee Literary Stratford Society, Glee Club, Racket Tennis Club, and was a forward
        on the freshman and sophomore basketball teams. The scrapbook contains personal notes,
        commencement address, playbills and programs from theater and musical productions, ribbons,
        pressed flowers, paper napkins, and other ephemera.</p>
      <p>Bishop attended many music and theater events. The scrapbook includes programs from student
        recitals and theater productions at the Normal School for Women, as well as programs from
        visiting performers, including the Weber Male Quartet, violinist Jules Falk, the Chicago
        Orchestral Choir, the Elsie Herndon Kearns Theater Company, and Redpath Bureau shows by
        Montraville M. Wood and the Adelphia Concert Artists. Bishop also attended many productions
        at the local New Virginia Theatre, in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Of particular note are
        playbills from D. W. Griffith's "The Birth of a Nation" (1916) and "Intolerance" (1917), and
        the "Elks' Minstrels" put on the by Staunton Lodge No. 351 (1916). She attended the
        "Lee-Jackson Day Celebration," put on by the Turner Ashby Chapter of the United Daughters of
        the Confederacy (1917), "A Woman and her Worth: a Great Message to Women and Girls Only," by
        Charles W. Brewbaker, and the music and dance group, "Bells Famous Hawaiians" (1918). A note
        on a napkin documents a car ride and picnic lunch on the "side of Massanutten Mountain,"
        with faculty member, Dr. Wayland and his children.</p>
      <p>The scrapbook also includes a photograph, dated 1939, with a handwritten note to Stella
        from Sonya, and an accompanying Alumnae Home-coming program from 1939. These items appear to
        be unrelated to the scrapbook, but because there is no acquisition documentation and they
        were boxed together at the time of processing, they are included with the scrapbook.</p>
