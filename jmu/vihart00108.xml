      </p>
      <p>Elizabeth "Libby" Wampler Custer was born on March 27, 1913 in Dayton, Virginia to Charles
        Wampler Sr. and Sadie Zigler Wampler. The Wampler family has been one of the most
        influential families in the Rockingham County, Virginia area. Libby's father was a pioneer
        in poultry raising and was considered the founder of the modern turkey industry. In 1927 he
        and two brothers established the Wampler Feed and Seed Company. One of nine children, Libby
        worked in the family business from a young age. She later attended Juniata College, a Church
        of the Brethren liberal arts college in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. She married Harry Lawson
        Custer (November 17, 1909 to February 22, 1981), a Fulks Run native, on October 12, 1934,
        and continued working with him in their poultry processing business, Virginia Valley
        Processors, Inc. They had three children, Kay, Stephen and Judy.</p>
      <p>Throughout her life Libby also expressed herself through painting. Between 1935 and 1959
        Libby occasionally took classes taught by Olive Delp Graham at Bridgewater College. In 1964,
        at the age of 41, Libby participated in the first adult education class offered by
        Harrisonburg Public Schools under Mrs. Carrie K. Showalter. Over the years, Libby has
        painted various properties, homesteads, and scenic vistas at the request of friends and
        family, often on unconventional materials such as planks of wood, reflecting her pragmatism:
          <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote"
          xlink:href="">You can paint on anything.</title> An exhibit of her work and a reception in
        her honor was hosted in 2007 by the Harrisonburg-Rockingham Historical Society, where she
        continues to volunteer.</p>

          xlink:href="">Harry Custer and Virginia Valley Processors, Inc.</title>
      </p>
      <p>The history of Virginia Valley Processors is part of a larger <title
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote"
          xlink:href="">family tree</title> of poultry and other business ventures. After starting a
        small business in 1928, Custer made a name for himself as a distributor of poultry and eggs
        in the Washington, D.C. area in the 1930s. In 1942, Custer bought property in Hinton,
        Virginia, where he had decided to settle. After serving in the Navy during World War II,
        Harry made a living hauling live poultry and established H.L. Custer Poultry in 1947,
        originally operating from a barn on the property. The business flourished, with Custer
        distributing poultry to markets in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Philadelphia, as well as
        entering into business ventures in West Virginia. In 1956, he and two associates, Homer and
        Jim Long, organized as Virginia Valley Processors, Inc., which operated from a plant on the
        property in Hinton through the 1960s. By 1970 the company merged with his father-in-law's
        company, Wampler Feed and Seed, Inc., and other Wampler family operations which were
        reorganized as Wampler Foods, Inc. The Hinton plant thus became the processing division,
        with Custer serving as vice president and a member of the board of directors.</p>
      <p>A 1984 merger with poultry processor Horace W. Longacre resulted in the formation of
        Wampler-Longacre, Inc. Shortly after another acquisition in 1988, the company reorganized as
        WLR Foods, Inc., and continued to acquire several other businesses in the decades that
        followed. In 2001, Pilgrim's Pride, Inc., acquired WLR Foods, Inc. In 2004, after a reported
        three year loss, Pilgrim's Pride, Inc., announced the pending closure of the Hinton plant.
        This prompted swift action by the newly formed Virginia Poultry Grower's Cooperative, Inc.,
        in its successful efforts to purchase the plant. The Hinton plant continues to operate today
        under the Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative, Inc.</p>

          render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Libby</title> Custer Papers, ca. 1930s-1997,
        consist of one 1/2 Hollinger box (.209 linear feet) of business and personal records relating
        to the Custer family business, Virginia Valley Processors, Inc., of Hinton, Virginia. The
        collection is arranged in three series: Account Books, Publications and Clippings, and
        Digitized Material. </p>
      <p><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold"
          xlink:href="">Account Books, 1951-1955,</title> includes payroll accounts, live poultry
        purchases, and refrigeration expenses during transport. The original covers were removed and
        the pages retained. One payroll account book records the names, hours worked, and rates of
        pay of female employees from February 18, 1955 until December 21, 1955, while a second
        account book documents the names, hours worked, and rates of pay of male employees from
        April 29, 1955 until December 30, 1955. Information regarding a possible temporary closing
        of the plant is also present. An account book regarding a possible temporary closure of the
        plant is also present. An account book regarding live poultry purchases between May 17, 1954
        and December 21, 1955, documents the seller, type of poultry (i.e. toms, hens, culls,
        chicks) and amount paid. Pages from the account book of Cassco Ice consists of twenty pages
        that document expenses for transporting refrigerated dressed poultry to various named
        vendors, including dates, lot numbers, number of boxes, and cost. The last three pages
        contain entries from 1951-1952 recording stock purchases, listing stocks, shares purchased,
        cost, and dividends.</p>

          xlink:href="">Publications and Clippings, 1939-1997,</title> consists of photocopies of
        articles and brochures relating to the local poultry industry and its history. One folder
        contains seven issues of the Wampler Foods, Inc., publication <title
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote"
          xlink:href="">Turkey Talk.</title> Another folder of material pertains to the takeover of
        one of the Virginia Valley Processors' New York customers, Murray Packing Company, in 1963
        allegedly by an organized crime family under the auspices of Berkshire Foods. As a result,
        Virginia Valley Processors suffered an unrecoverable loss of $200,000. Also notable in this
        series are biographical information relating to Harry Custer's 1973 Virginia Poultry
        Federation awards and a typed memorial after his death in 1981, a news clipping regarding
        Charles W. Wampler Jr.'s 1997 Lifetime Achievement Award in Industry from the Science Museum
        of Virginia, and an undated article about a longtime employee of the Hinton plant, Sissy
        Obaugh.</p>
