      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>According to notes from the donor the ledger was given to Benjamin Garber in 1870 and the
        original leather bound ledger had the name and date of Benjamin Garber, 1870 inscribed on
        the front cover along with the letters "LD." The back of the ledger contained the letters
        "IXO" along with the date 1848. Notes from the donor also suggest that the ledger may
        originated from the Pine Forge iron foundry once located along Smith Creek near New Market,
        Virginia and operated by the Pennybacker family. The ledger contains accounts for D.
        Pennybacker and also Pine Forge, and the handwriting within the ledger is identical to that
        of an earlier Pine Forge Ledger, contained in the Don C. Miller Collection. According to
        donor notes, the ledger was given to Benjamin Garber in 1870.</p>
      <p>The account for D. Pennybacker is most likely Dirck Pennyback, 1737 - 1799, who came to the
        Shenandoah Valley in 1781 and built Redwell Furnace along Hawksbill Creek near Luray,
        Virginia. Around 1785 he also established an iron-working business called Pine Forge along
        Smith Creek near New Market, Virginia. Dirck Pennybacker operated Pine Forge with his son
        Benjamin--also represented in the ledger--until Dirck died in 1799, at which point Benjamin
        continued operations until the early 19th century when ownership changed. Pine Forge was an
        extensive and successful operation and was well known throughout the county.</p>
