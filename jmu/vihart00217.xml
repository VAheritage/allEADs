        <p>At some point during initial processing and for unknown reasons, the envelopes that

          The letters were dated based on the postmark on the envelopes and based on information
          provided by the donor. In order to streamline the process of applying collection numbers,
          Special Collections staff completed a large-scale renumbering campaign in the spring of

      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Bertha Couchman Hess was born April 20, 1884 to David Calvin Couchman and Lucy Gordon
        Couchman of West Virginia. She married Robert Newton Hess (1880-1854) on June 20 1917 in
        Martinsburg, West Virginia. She died in April 1980 and is buried at Darkesville Cemetery in
        Berkelely County, West Virginia.</p>
      <p>Ethel Virginia Dunn, Hess' niece, was born September 29, 1903 to William Nelson Dunn and
        Mary Catherine Couchman Dunn of Martinsburg, West Virginia. Dunn matriculated into the State
        Normal School for Women at Harrisonburg in 1923 and attended for two years. She was a member
        of the Choral Club, Racquet Tennis Club, Athletic Association, and Y. W. C. A. She went on
        to attend Rutgers University where she received a Bachelor of Science degree in education.
        Dunn was a school teacher Morgantown, West Virginia for four years before continuing her
        career in New Brunswick, New Jersey where she taught for 44 years. Dunn died February 9,
        2002 and is buried at Rosedale Cemetery in Martinsburg, West Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Bertha Couchman Hess and Ethel Virginia Dunn Correspondence, 1918-1927, is comprised of
        four postcards and seven letters written by Hess and her niece Dunn to their family in
        Martinsburg, West Virginia. Couchman authored three postcards while visiting Harrisonburg in
        August 1918 and the remainder of the correspondence was written by Dunn while she was a
        student at the State Teachers College at Harrisonburg and while she was a teacher in
        Morgantown, West Virginia.</p>
      <p>In Hess' three postcards to family she mentions that she is having a nice time (she
        attended the fair) and that Harrisonburg is a "beautiful little town" of about 6,000 people.
        The postcards feature scenic views of Harrisonburg and the State Normal School for
        Women.</p>
      <p>Dunn's correspondence dates primarily from her time as a student at the State Normal School
        for Women. In a postcard written to her grandmother, postmarked October 19, 1923, Dunn
        describes how she plans to spend her free time: "I am going on a hike Saturday. We are going
        up to the mountains for chestnuts. This certainly is a pretty little town and I like it real
        well." The postcard features a view of the court house. An additional five letters are
        included from Dunn's time as a student and are dated 1924-1925. She wrote to her
        grandmother, Lucy Gordon Couchman, and her Aunt Bert, presumably the aforementioned Bertha
        Couchman Hess. Dunn's letters include descriptions of Harrisonburg and campus: "This is a
        very pretty town and the view of the mountains are lovely. I never saw such lovely sunsets
        before. We have a beautiful school. There are eight large stone buildings with red tile
        roofs." She also provides detailed accounts of life as a student including descriptions of
        classes, roommates, social events, meals, weather, and receiving care packages. She makes
        frequent mention of her cousin Sadie and Aunt Laura who live in town. Dunn also describes a
        trip to Clifton Forge, Virginia in March 1925, during the holiday between quarters.</p>
      <p>Dunn's last letter is dated November 29, 1927 at which point she is teaching school in
        Morgantown, West Virginia. She describes the Thanksgiving holiday during which she threw a
        party for her students. Her class also put together a box of groceries for a needy
        family.</p>
