            <p>At the point that the first oral histories were accessioned, the audio was converted from .wav files to .mp3s to create an access copy.

            <p>A second accession comprised of 82 cds, included the original recordings submitted by students, as well as preservation copies of the interview material, prepared by Dr. Kerr. Most of the cds included the audio recording (.mp3 and WAVE file), and a transcript, background journal, and an interview guide (.pdf and .doc). All media is labelled with the collection number, interview number, and a unique id, and is housed in the Special Collections media cabinet.</p>
