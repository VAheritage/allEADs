      <p>The Staunton Academy in Staunton, Virginia, was incorporated in 1792, but a formal
        schoolhouse was not completed until after 1810. The Academy was founded from funds raised
        through bond sales, and also from state funds raised through the sale of glebe lands. The
        administration of the Academy was first entrusted to James G. Waddell and Bartholomew
        Fuller, who were the Academy's first principals and faculty, the former teaching classics
        and the latter teaching mathematics. In 1833, Lyttleton Waddell became joint principal with
        William Cooke, and Waddell continued as principal for more than twenty years. During that
        time, the school was very prosperous, attracting many pupils from abroad. The final
        principals to be appointed by the Board of Trustees were Pike Powers and Charles E. Young.
        In the 1872-1873 school year, the Staunton public schools were crowded with 375 children.
        The Staunton Academy, who had 25 day students in 1873, was asked for the use of their
        building by the public schools. As of 1873, the Staunton Academy became a public school.

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>The Staunton Academy Records, 1808-1828, consist of ten items housed in a single
        legal-size folder within a half sized legal Hollinger box. The collection is comprised
        almost exclusively of minutes from the board of trustees' meetings of the Staunton Academy
        as well as correspondence and issues addressed at said meetings. Of particular interest is
        an 1818 document that lists the original members of the board when the Staunton Academy was
        established in 1792. </p>
