         <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
         <p>John W. Crist was born on February 27, 1841 in Virginia. He married Mary E. (1844-1903)
            and had a son named Edwin Geary Crist (1866-1922) and a daughter named Hattie Belle
            Crist (1874-1959), later Hattie Belle Myers. After serving with the Confederate Army as
            a Lieutenant, he served as postmaster of Sangerville, Virginia until as late as 1890.
            During his time as postmaster he also managed a store until his death on October 2,
            1913.</p>
         <p>The telephone company mentioned in the Kiracofe account booklet is potentially the
            Farmers Mutual Telephone Company, created February 16, 1903, with the principal office
            being located in Sangerville, Virginia to serve Augusta County. At the time of creation,
            the executive office was as follows: A. Senger, President; S. L. Hess, Vice-President;
            L. V. Miller, Secretary; and A. J. Miller, Treasurer. In 1960, the company service was
            re-named the Shenandoah Telephone Company, and became a subsidiary of the Shenandoah
            Telecommunications Company (Shentel), which still is in operation today.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Account Booklets with John W. Crist, 1895-1909, comprise two receipt booklets that
            document purchases made at John W. Crist's store in Sangerville, Virginia. One booklet
            was kept by Rebecca Jane Michael Kiracofe (written as Mrs. William Kiracofe on the
            booklet) and the other was kept by an unidentified person. Both follow the same basic
            format, with the month and the year at the top of the page, and all the items they
            bought from John W. Crist with corresponding prices. Both accounts take up no more than
            half the pages in the booklet. </p>
         <p>In the booklet owned by Mrs. Kiracofe, there are multiple pages with the constitution
            and written by-laws of the Telephone Company Line No. 26 and 2. There are twelve
            articles in all. They cover the duties of the company's executive board, the duties of
            the shareholders, and the duties of all employed by the company (as noted in Article 10,
            Section 3: "Business must always have preference to mere pleasure or amusement). There
            are three names listed at the end of the articles: A. J. Kiracofe, Dr. George S. Fultz,
            and T. J. Argenbright (1860-1937), a teacher. It is speculated that these three were put
            in charge of Lines 26 and 2 of the then-developing Farmers Mutual Telephone Company.
