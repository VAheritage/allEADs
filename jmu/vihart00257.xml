            <p>The collection was donated with basic groupings applied to materials (e.g. Trumbo
               family photographs were grouped together, Ella Heatwole Jacobson materials were
               grouped together, all postcards were grouped together regardless of recipient). The
               collection included several full newspaper issues that were collected for family
               obituaries. Those obituaries were photocopied and the original newspapers discarded.
               Other miscellaneous non-local newspapers were discarded.</p>

         <p>The Virginia Heatwoles represented in this collection descended from David Heatwole
            (1767-1845) who was the eldest son of Johann Mathias Heatwole (1711-1776). David
            Heatwole, with his wife Magdalene and young family in tow, left Pennsylvania in the
            late-eighteenth century and settled near Harrisonburg, Virginia.</p>
         <p>Heatwole family members documented in this collection are fourth and fifth generation
            descendants of David Heatwole and include Daniel Franklin "D. F." Heatwole (1854-1922)
            and Sarah "Sallie" Margaret Lineweaver Heatwole (1857-1939) and their children Leonard
            Charles Heatwole (1891-1969), Daniel Rufus Heatwole (1894-1957), Alvin Bruer Heatwole
            (1888-1983), Elmer David Heatwole (1885-1964), and Ella Catherine Heatwole Jacobson
            (1883-1918).</p>
         <p>Daniel F. Heatwole was an older brother of Cornelius Jacob Heatwole (1868-1939), who was
            appointed the Head of the Department of Education at the State Normal and Industrial
            School for Women at Harrisonburg. In 1893, Daniel F. Heatwole was appointed postmaster
            to Sparkling Springs in Rockingham County and in 1899, he was appointed by Judge Grattan
            to land assessor of the Linville District. He otherwise occupied himself with
            agricultural pursuits as a farmer.</p>
         <p>Ella Heatwole Jacobson graduated from the State Normal and Industrial School for Women
            at Harrisonburg in 1912 with a professional degree. While a student, Ella was a member
            of the Lee Literary Society and also served as chairwoman of the YWCA's bible study
            committee. Prior to marrying Anton Nikolai Jacobson on February 7, 1917 and moving to
            Cutbank, Montana, where her brother Elmer was also a resident, Ella taught school in
            Rockingham County, Virginia and was a member of the Singers Glen Baptist Church. She
            died August 21, 1918 in Montana from a complication of diseases. Her body was returned
            to Virginia in the company of her parents and her brother Elmer. She is buried at Cooks
            Creek Presbyterian Church Cemetery.</p>
         <p>David F. Lineweaver, Sallie Heatwole's father, is also well-documented in this
            collection. Daniel F. Heatwole, Sallie's husband, acted as the administrator of
            Lineweaver's estate.</p>
         <p>Leonard Heatwole married Nora Ellen Trumbo Heatwole (1894-1987) on June 18, 1925.
            Leonard served with the American Expeditionary Forces in France during WWI and was the
            registrar of the Mt. Clinton precinct for 35 years prior to retiring in 1967. Nora was
            born January 29, 1894 to John Riddle Trumbo and Sarah Fulk Trumbo of Fulks Run,
            Virginia. The collection descended through this line of the Heatwole family via Leonard
            and Nora's daughter Madeline Ann Heatwole Stewart (1926-2012) and her husband Donald
            William Stewart (b. 1920).</p>

               <head>Scope and Content</head>
               <p>Series 1: Correspondence, 1891-1939, is comprised primarily of postcards,
                  Christmas cards, and general correspondence sent to and between Heatwole family
                  members. The correspondence is arranged primarily by recipient, but in cases where
                  the recipient is unknown (e.g. non-specific salutations and greetings or lack of
                  return address), the correspondence is filed by author.</p>
               <p>Given that the bulk of this series is comprised of postcards and Christmas cards,
                  the correspondence is generally chatty and newsy in tone. The contents often
                  relates to family and community news and also includes sentiments of longing for
                  correspondence in return. The postcards themselves portray local and national
                  places of interest (and in some cases international places) as well as holiday
                  imagery. General correspondence is more substantive and includes letters written
                  by Leonard Heatwole to family members while he was serving in WWI.</p>
               <p>Daniel F. Heatwole correspondence includes a draft letter to the Honorable Charles
                  Triplett O'Ferrall regarding O'Ferrall's petition to change mail arrangements and
                  an October 5, 1908 letter from Cornelius Heatwole in which "Corney" alerts Daniel
                  that "I made my will before leaving Virginia, and in it, named you as my executor
                  without consulting you about it." A letter from an unknown correspondent is
                  included in which the author furnishes Daniel Heatwole with "some traditional
                  history of our beautiful valley not generally known to the present
                  generation."</p>

                  individuals. Names of customers include D. B. Armentrout, B. B. Miller, William
                  Henkle, Tomas H. Showalter, and Jonathan Wampler. David Heatwole (1767-1842), who
                  was the first-born son of Johann Mathias Heatwole (ancestor of the Virginia
                  Heatwole line), learned the shoemaking trade from his uncle Christian Hess of
                  Cootes Store. He went on to construct his own shoemaker's shop near Harrisonburg.
                  While the aforementioned shoemaker's account book post-dates David Heatwole, it is
                  not unlikely that one of his descendants would have also picked up the trade.</p>
               <p>Of particular interest are three folders of Transfers of Real Estate for the
                  Central District of Rockingham County, 1884-1909. These transfers do not document
                  the Heatwole family explicitly so it seems likely that a member of the family,
                  perhaps D. F. Heatwole, was acting in some official capacity to facilitate the
                  real estate transfers. These documents describe the two parties involved in the
                  real estate transfer and a brief description of the tract of land with a monetary
                  valuation. D. H. Lee Martz served as the Rockingham County Clerk during this time
                  period. Additionally, materials related to the sale of Heatwole family land
                  adjacent to the Mt. Clinton School to the Rockingham County School Board is
                  included.</p>

               <p>Series 3: Personal Papers, 1838-1969, contains legal documents, ephemera, recipes,
                  a diary, school materials related to the State Normal and Industrial School for
                  Women at Harrisonburg, and military records primarily created and collected by
                  select Heatwole family members.</p>
               <p>Ella Heatwole Jacobson's papers include a large selection of play bills for
                  dramatic on-campus productions and other ephemera from her time as a student at
                  the State Normal and Industrial School for Women at Harrisonburg. Event
                  invitations and a membership invitation to join the Lee Literary Society is also
                  included. A daily schedule, program card, report card, diploma, and 1914 diary are
                  also included. Ella's papers also contain a map and other material related to her
                  time living in Montana.</p>
               <p>Daniel F. Heatwole's papers are comprised of his 1893 appointment to postmaster at
                  Sparkling Springs in Rockingham County and a published pamphlet of instructions to
                  land assessors dated 1914.</p>
               <p>Leonard Heatwole's papers include documents, blank postcards, and ephemera from
                  his military service abroad during WWI. Some material is in French and German.
                  Published material includes a <emph render="italic">Carte Taride, No. 2</emph> of
                  France, <emph render="italic">Speake French: A Book for the Soldiers</emph>, <emph
                     render="italic">The Dauphiné Leave Area: A Historical and Geographical

               <p>Series 4: Photographs, 1877-1965, primarily documents the Heatwole family of Mt.
                  Clinton and the Trumbo and Fawley families of Fulks Run. The photographs are
                  largely black-and-white with many of the subjects' identities inscribed on the
                  backs of the photos. A selection of real photo postcards are also contained in
                  this series.</p>
               <p>The Trumbo family photographs comprise the bulk of the series. They are more
                  candid in nature and depict groups of people and landscape. Brocks Gap and Chimney
                  Rock are prominently featured as is the John Riddle Trumbo homestead. In addition
                  to the Trumbos and Fawleys, the Byrd, Bliss, and Ritchie families are represented
                  in these photographs. Persons depicted include Leonard and Nora Trumbo Heatwole
                  (with her horse Queen), Sarah Ann Fulk Trumbo, Rebecca Fawley, Wayne Fawley,
                  Madeline Heatwole, and John Riddle Trumbo.</p>
               <p>The Heatwole family photographs are almost exclusively portraits with a few group
                  and candid photographs. Persons depicted include Ella Heatwole Jacobson (including
                  a copper plate on a wood block), A. B. Heatwole Jr., and Beverly Heatwole
                  Smith.</p>
               <p>A small selection of photographs and photocopied photographs is contained within
                  Series 5.</p>
