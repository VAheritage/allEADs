         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Bluegrass Music in the Shenandoah Valley Oral History, 1991 is comprised of an audio recording and transcript associated with an interview conducted with JMU English professor, Cameron C. Nickels, who discusses bluegrass and country music in general, and his experiences as a bluegrass musician. Describes training, both by others and self-taught, on various instruments including classical and folk, with guitar as his primary instrument. Reminisces about the Hippie Movement and the influence that music had on his life during the late 1960s and early 70s. Recalls learning how to finger pick and experiences teaching at the Mill City School of Folk Music in Minneapolis, St. Paul. Describes his first exposure to bluegrass music. Compares and contrasts Western and Eastern bluegrass (influence of the Grand Ole Opry and Appalachian music), and East Coast bluegrass. Talks about various musicians in the Shenandoah Valley who have influenced him (Ben May and Bugsy Frank, banjo); and various groups he has played with including "Two-Gun Terry and Friends" and "Dominion Express" (Eddy Michael, fiddle; Frank Evans, guitar; and Two-Gun Terry, bass, mandolin, fiddle; Spike Stroop, fiddle; and others). Mentions cutting a recording; types of music they have played and sung, from bluegrass to country to gospel; their playing schedule; and types of places they have played. Discusses the definition of a folk musician and the concept of learning songs through an oral tradition. Mentions favorite bluegrass songs and other professional groups. In general provides a perspective on how performing music has played an important role in his life.</p>
         <p>Recorded at Dr. Cameron Nickels' office at Keezell Hall, Rm. 409, James Madison University, Harrisonburg, Va. on November 21, 1991.</p>
