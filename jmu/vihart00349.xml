         <p>The Harrisonburg Court Square Oral History Collection, 1990, is comprised of audio interviews, transcripts, and background papers, documenting the impact of the construction of the Valley Mall in 1978 on downtown Harrisonburg. This oral history series shows how the Valley Mall changed the face and atmosphere of downtown Harrisonburg by comparing and contrasting the present Court Square area with the same area prior to the completion of the Mall. Interviews were conducted with three Harrisonburg citizens who reflected varying viewpoints on this subject. They were: Ronn Short, former owner of a local business; Terri Denton, manager of a family-owned local business, Denton's Furniture; and Bob Sullivan, Harrisonburg City Planner.</p>

               <p>This monograph gives a brief chronological history of the downtown Court Square area of Harrisonburg, Virginia, beginning with its founding in 1780 by Thomas Harrison and ending with an assessment of the area's status in 1990, twelve years following the completion of the regional Valley Mall in 1978. Traces the Square's development and later demise as a shopping district, and various attempts at revitalization.  Describes the Court Square area, the spring/creek and courthouse, and other surrounding buildings and their uses over the years. Shows how the downtown area became a gathering place for social, economic/business and legal activities during the 19th and 20th centuries. Describes the court days of the early 1800's through the 1930's, and records the development of local downtown businesses including banks (ex. Virginia National, Rockingham National Bank), and family-owned/other shopping business (ex. Joseph Ney's, J.C. Penny's, Leggett's, McCrory's, Woolworth's, and the A&amp;N store). Traces the building of the Valley Mall with consequent competition for downtown businesses, resulting in the relocation and/or closing of some. Describes concurrent/consequent attempts at revitalization by the Harrisonburg Downtown Development Corporation, and actions by the Rockingham Board of Supervisors. Compares/contrasts Harrisonburg situation with that of Staunton.</p>

                  <p>This interview records the reflections and viewpoints of Mr. Ronn Short, former owner of Colonial Touch Bake Shop/Cafe (now out of business), on the atmosphere and condition of Court Square, Harrisonburg, Va. before and after the completion of the Valley Mall in 1978. His opinions reflect those of a long-time resident and shopper of the area; also as a former businessman. Reminisces about the small-town atmosphere of a busy centrally-locally downtown area ten to twenty years ago (ex. the feeling of community/comaraderie which existed). Describes the area as being the location for shopping (department, five-and-dimes such as McCrory's, clothing, other small retail stores) and professional offices (attorneys, accountants, doctors, etc.). Mentions customer relations and the use of traditional merchandising techniques (compared and contrasted to today's advertising methods); Christmas shopping. Compares and contrasts regional shopping areas; notes impact of highway systems on shopping developments and shoppers' habits. Believes downtown has changed from a retail/shopping center, drawing people from all over the region (incl. W. Va.), to a professional office-type area. Opinions that the Mall was responsible for the demise of downtown shopping, with the relocation of the two main department stores (Penney's and Leggett's) to the Mall. Believes strongly that parking and access/convenience to businesses are the main reasons why people do not frequent the Square today. Mentions traffic patterns; revitalization attempts; shopping patterns of today; relations between the town and James Madison University; and proposed new County jail. Regrets the sense of loss of community in the downtown area. Refers to the following stores: McCrory's, Leggett's, Penney's, Alfred and Joseph Neys', Woolworth's, Bride's House, A&amp;N, Image Boutique, Cato's, Valley Books, Jewelry Box, Colonial Optical, Whitesel Music, Schewel Furniture. Mentions sandwich shops/restaurants such as: Jess' Quick Lunch, The Palmer House Restaurants, Calhoun's, Joshua Wilton House; entertainment spots such as the Elbow Room, and movie theaters such as the Virginia and State Theaters. Refers to the big fire which destroyed a city block [1968]. Mentions the following banks: Virginia National Bank, Black Diamond; also Harrison Plaza (professional complex). Recorded at the home of Amy Accles, Harrisonburg, Va. on Feb. 6, 1990.</p>

               <p>This interview records the reflections and viewpoints of Ms. Terri Denton, manager of a locally-run family-owned business, Denton's Furniture, on the atmosphere and condition of Court Square, Harrisonburg, Va. before and after the completion of the Valley Mall in 1978. [Note: Denton's Furniture went out of business in 1991]. Her opinions reflect those of a long-time resident and merchant of the area. Reviews a brief history of the family business, first begun in 1878, with mention of various family members and discussion of buildings owned over the years. Reminisces about the small-town atmosphere of a busy centrally-locally downtown area twenty years ago (ex. a feeling of community between merchants; the typical shopper; Friday nights on the town, and the general sense of comraderie that existed). Discusses the effect of the Mall on the Court Square and concerns over the relocation of the two major department stores (Penney's and Leggett's) and failure of J. Neys. Compares and contrasts regional shopping areas; notes impact of highway systems on shopping developments and shoppers' habits. Believes downtown has changed from a retail hub to a banking/lawyer/financial district. Sees impact of Mall in vacant buildings, less traffic flow and net income. Discusses various retail merchant's associations, including the Downtown Harrisonburg Merchant's Association and its support of community events (Christmas parade, Farmer's Market) and lessening influence. Sees general growth of Harrisonburg and increased competition (ex. chains such as Wal-mart and Rose's) as being the biggest challenge to a family-owned furniture business. Discusses shoppers habits; downtown revitalization efforts (ex. beautification, controversial ban on public events on the court lawn). Regrets the sense of loss of community in the downtown area, yet expresses a positive view of its future (ex. new small entrepreneur businesses; building of a new County Jail, proposed new parking deck; and relations with James Madison University. Refers to the following stores: Leggett's, Penney's Alfred and Joseph Neys', Woolworth's, Grand Piano, Schewel Furniture; Hostetter Drugstore, Hughes' Pharmacy, People's Drugstore; Wilson Jewelers; Studio Art Shop; Gitchell's, Harrison's Antiques. Mentions sandwich shops/restaurants such as: Jess' Quick Lunch, the Famous Restaurant, Spanky's Delicatessen, Belzona Cafe, Calhoun's. Refers to the public library; historic Morrison House. Recorded at the Denton's Furniture Store, 61 Court Square, Harrisonburg, Va. on Feb. 7, 1990.</p>
