      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Etta Frances Evans was born in 1917 in Essex County, Virginia to James W. and Hattie Evans.
        She matriculated into the State Teachers College at Harrisonburg in 1934 and graduated in
        1936 with a professional diploma in primary kindergarten. She was active in the Alpha
        Literary Society, the Hiking Club, and Y. W. C. A. and was known by her friends and
        classmates as "Cotton." Her younger sister Sarah also attended the State Teachers College at
        Harrisonburg.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Etta Evans Scrapbook, 1935-1936, is comprised of one bound scrapbook containing
        memorabilia, ephemera, and correspondence from Evans' time as a student at the State
        Teachers College at Harrisonburg. Evans annotated the scrapbook by describing the items
        pasted within. The scrapbook is nearly complete with the exception of a few missing items.
        Adhesive remains and annotations are present for items that became separated from the
        scrapbook.</p>
      <p>n addition to correspondence, the scrapbook includes programs, newspaper clippings, notes,
        cards, invitations, ticket stubs, matchbooks, and other ephemera. Specific items include a
        postcard of the Washington Monument, a postcard from South Boston, Virginia, promotional
        material from Friddle's Restaurant, Halloween party invitations, church programs, and Camel
        cigarette packaging.</p>
      <p>Evans was careful to describe each item, usually in a quippy tone. For example, of an
        invitation to attend an education department tea at the Alumnae Hall reception room, Evans
        wrote, "Another tea! I skipped tho because it always proves boring for me." Other
        annotations are purely informational. Of a train ticket, Evans wrote, "Ticket from Richmond
        to Gordonsville. Sally took me to the terminal. Bob met me a few miles up on the Skyline
        Drive. Had supper in Elkton. Got on campus at 10:00."</p>
      <p>Evans also kept materials related to dating in her scrapbook. Related materials include
        correspondence and calling cards from potential suitors. Evans described her relationship,
        or lack thereof, with Joseph Foote Kinney of Bridgewater College, whose calling card is
        included – "Wouldn't go downtown with him because he was too short. Ha! Don't tell him. Min
        is taking care of him now." Another gentleman caller who received a similar discriminating
        judgement was "Higgins," a potential suitor who wrote Evans several letters contained within
        the scrapbook. Evans described him as a runt, crazy, and spoiled.</p>
