         <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
         <p>Christopher B. Martin, journalist, has had a career as a reporter-photographer for a number of regional newspapers and for WJMA Radio News, Orange, Va. 
In January 1979, the Adolph Coors Brewing Company announced it was considering acquiring an area of land in Rockingham County for its new Eastern brewery. It was not until later that year that Coors decided to construct the brewery in Rockingham County, Virginia, rather than North Carolina. Local citizens had mixed feelings about this. Many people felt that the brewery and the coming of industry to the area would significantly help the economy. For example, Coors projected the creation of 1,200 jobs. Others from the local community believed that creating 1,200 jobs would create a greater need for homes, schools, and other public services thereby increasing local taxes.  Still others believed that brewing beer in the Shenandoah Valley would increase alcoholism, and corrupt the morals of Rockingham County citizens. In a letter to the editor of the Harrisonburg Daily News-Record a concerned citizen wrote, "Alcohol makes alcoholics, and beer is alcohol. Let them go away. Let our good land, our good grain, and our good resources be used for something better."  (DNR, January 29, 1979, p.6)</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>Christopher B. Martin Oral Histories, c. 1980s, consists of two undated typed transcripts of interviews conducted by Christopher B. Martin concerning the Coors controversy, which began in 1979. Interviewees are F. Everette Smith, president of the local Farm Bureau Association and poultry farmer; and Eugene K. Souder, co-chairman of the Rockingham County Concerned Citizens and pastor of a church in Grottoes. Both interviews represent positions against the Coors Company. Smith discussed zoning issues, and what he felt was the waste of good agricultural land. Souder discussed the moral and social implications of a large-scale local brewery in Rockingham County.</p>
