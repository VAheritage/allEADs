<head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
<p>Rockingham Union Lodge No. 27 was charted on October 29, 1789. Many original lodge members had had Masonic roots in England, Ireland, and Scotland prior to the establishment of a Grand Lodge in the United States. In 1777, delegates from several lodges in Virginia met to discuss establishing a Grand Lodge in the United States. As a result, the Grand Lodge of Virginia thus became the first Grand Lodge of Masonry in North America.
</p>
<p>The first meeting place was reputedly at the residence of William Cravens, although there is some question as to whether Cravens ever actually owned a home in Harrisonburg. Some time after Cravens' death in 1793, there was talk of constructing a Masonic Temple. In 1795 a building committee was appointed to take charge of this task. A lot was purchased at the corner of Federal Alley and East Market Street and constructed soon thereafter. The first meeting at the new Masonic Temple, also known as Mason's Hall, was held on July 14, 1796. 
</p>
<p>By 1860 membership had grown enough to warrant a new temple. In February of that year, an agreement was made to exchange lots with D.H. Gambill, who owned property across East Market Street known as the <title render="doublequote">Old Stone Church,</title> with the stipulation that the Lodge had would occupy the upper floors of their original building for twelve months. However, the Lodge had the opportunity to purchase a lot from Thomas Yancey a few days later at the corner of South Main and Water Street for six hundred dollars. The <title render="doublequote">Old Stone Church</title> property was advertised for sale, and sold in 1865 to J.R. Jones for eight hundred dollars. On July 4, 1860, a ceremony documenting the laying of the new cornerstone was held, and several items were sealed within it. On April 6, 1861, the new building was dedicated and available for use. 
</p>
<p>On December 5, 1892, with expansion in mind, the Lodge purchased the lot across the street, occupied by the Revere Hotel. Membership continued to grow, so by 1903 plans were made to demolish the hotel and construct a new temple on the hotel site, the cost of which was $18,000. The cornerstone from the old temple was opened and the contents removed. On September 5, 1905, during a ceremony for the laying of the new cornerstone, more items were added to the original collection and sealed. On December 27, 1906, the new temple at 114 South Main Street was ready to occupy. 
</p>
<p>On October 28, 2006, the cornerstone of Rockingham Union Lodge No. 27 was opened during renovations of the century-old building. A public banquet was held on December 4, 2006, during which the cornerstone's contents were displayed. Graciously, the Lodge gave permission to allow the contents to be photocopied [and scanned] for research use. As of December 2006, the Lodge had not yet determined whether the original contents will be returned to the cornerstone after renovations are complete.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Rockingham Union Lodge No. 27 A.F. and A.M. Collection consists of photocopies of items removed from an 8"x 10"x 6" copper plated box in the cornerstone of the Masonic Temple at 114 S. Main Street in Harrisonburg, Virginia on November 28, 2006. The collection is housed in thirteen folders within an oversized flat box and is arranged in four series: Documents, Pamphlets and Small Publications, Ephemera, and Oversized Items.
</p>
<p>Documents includes photocopies of handwritten or typed lists of items to have been included in the cornerstone in 1860 and 1905, as well as a program, speech, and lists of officers, Lodge members, and members of the Ladies Masonic Association. 
</p>
<p>Pamphlets and Small Publications contains photocopies of printed by-laws of Rockingham Union Lodge No. 27 and the Royal Arch Chapter No. 6, addresses, and programs pertaining to the Lodge's centennial in 1889, the laying of the cornerstone of the Lodge in 1905 as well as for the cornerstone of the Rockingham County Court House in 1896. 
</p>
<p>Ephemera contains photocopies of items that Lodge members deemed interesting to include in the cornerstone: coins and currency, blank membership forms, a calendar, and other items of interest. 
</p>
<p>Oversized Items [see <extref entityref="Newspapers">digital images</extref>] primarily consists of several pieced photocopies of newspapers from 1860, 1905, and 1906, some of which are quite rare. The issues of the <title render="italic">Virginia Citizen</title>, <title render="italic">Valley Democrat</title>, <title render="italic">Spirt of the Valley</title>, and <title render="italic">Harrisonburg Free Press</title> may be the only extant issues for those dates. The September 6, 1905 editions of the <title render="italic">Harrisonburg Daily News</title> were found on top of the copper box in the cornerstone, as the box was sealed on September 5th. The series also includes pieced photocopies of a remarkable 20"x 37" broadside advertising the laying of the 1860 cornerstone. 
</p>
<p>The cornerstone also contained seven publications that were retained by Rockingham Union Lodge No. 27 and not photocopied. A list of those publications is at the end of the contents list.
