      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This letter, dated December 27, 1864, was written by Cpl. William B. Durie to his “Dear
        Sister” during the Siege of Petersburg. This letter gives a glimpse at camp life during late
        1864. Durie is writing shortly after Christmas to inform his sister that he is alive and
        well. He goes on to describe the conditions of the camp and the front, as well as details on
        his state of being. He tells her of the cold weather that the men are enduring during the
        Siege of Petersburg during Christmas. Durie also informs his sister of his ongoing dental
        problems and that his tooth was pulled the day before Christmas. Durie mentions that his
        paper supply is running low with only four pieces remaining. He also reveals some personal
        details when he informs his sister that he no longer has money to send to her, only having
        twenty-five cents remaining.</p>
