         <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
         <p>Initially an extracurricular activity, theatre at the State Normal and Industrial School for Women at Harrisonburg received extensive participation from students. The first Senior Class Play, "Esmeralda" occurred in 1911 in Assembly Hall in Downtown Harrisonburg as an opening to the commencement activities of that year. From then on, Senior Class Plays became a school tradition and eventually expanded to freshmen, sophomores, and juniors. Some of these productions coincided with Class Days, which were also originally apart of commencement activities, or were performed between multiple classes, such as the junior class assisted by the freshmen class.</p>
         <p>The Athletic Association was established in 1910 with a goal "to promote physical, moral, mental development." The association was overseen by the Department of Physical Education and promoted interclass activities by planning Field Day exercises and May Day celebrations. They also presented charitable entertainment events. The association sponsored theatre productions until at least the 1940s. Today, the Athletic Association has evolved into the Division of Athletics that oversees athletic programs and sports at James Madison University. </p>
