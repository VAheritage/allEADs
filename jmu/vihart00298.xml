            <p>The donor's original order, including folder titles, was maintained whenever possible. The archivist imposed an order on any unordered files, titled any untitled files, and created discrete series. Social security numbers and bank account numbers have been redacted from materials. When possible, newspapers and clippings were photocopied and originals returned to donor. All material contained within three-ring binders was disbound and foldered in original order. During processing several folders were discovered to be empty. Their folder titles are as follows: Dream in Color Drafts, WHSV Children First 2010, WVPT Kid's Book Festival 2010, Poetry Month 2010, Winter Poetry Contest 2010, Marilyn Nelson Reading 2010, 73 Poems Honorariums (Music).

         <head>Administrative History</head>
         <p>The Furious Flower Poetry Center (FFPC) was established in 1999 by Joanne V. Gabbin when she was the director of James Madison University's Honors Program. With this flagship of the Honors Program, she continued the kind of programming she had begun by hosting the 1994 Furious flower Poetry Conference, which was the nation's first scholarly conference on Black poetry. The event was met with overwhelming praise, and The Washington Post called it an historic event. In 2005, following the success of the second Furious Flower Poetry Conference (2004), JMU gave the FFPC its official charter, making it the first academic center in the United States devoted to Black poetry. Gabbin became its executive director, leaving the Honors Program after 19 years of service.</p>
         <p>Today, the FFPC is committed to "cultivating, honoring, and promoting the diverse voices of African American poets by making the genre accessible to a wide audience and collaborating with educational and cultural institutions, literary organizations, and artists." It hosts visiting poets for readings at JMU and nearby venues; sponsors workshops; holds an annual poetry camp for elementary and middle school-aged children; produces texts, videos, DVDs and other materials on African-American poetry; and gathers poets and other scholars for intimate panels and seminars, as well as major conferences. FFPC has held three decennial Furious Flower Conferences: "A Revolution in African American Poetry" (1994), "Regenerating the Black Poetic Tradition" (2004), and "Seeding the Future of African American Poetry" (2014). </p>
         <p>FFPC is located off of Martin Luther King Jr. Way/Historic Cantrell Avenue. Beyond her duties as Executive Director of the Furious Flower Poetry Center, Joanne Gabbin is a professor of English at JMU, a published author, and a member of the International Literary Hall of Fame for Writers of African Descent.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Furious Flower Poetry Center Records, 1990-2014, consisting of 8.7 cubic feet (13 Hollinger boxes, 1 half-Hollinger box, 5 oversize flat boxes, 1 oversize flat folder), document the departmental activities of the Furious Flower Poetry Center, a unit formerly of the JMU Honor's Program that became its own separate academic center of the University in 2005. A portion of the material contained within the records derive from events and programs sponsored by the Furious Flower Poetry Center including 73 Poems for 73 Years: Celebrating the Life of Lucille Clifton, Lineage: The Margaret Walker Song Cycle, and an annual children's poetry camp. Specific types of materials include event posters and brochures, exhibit panels, logistical and planning documentation, and email correspondence. Materials related to publications produced by the Center such as Mourning Katrina: A Poetic Response to Tragedy and Shaping Memories: Reflections of African American Women Writers are comprised of draft manuscripts and correspondence with poets and publishers. Grant proposals and awards, many of which relate to the aforementioned events and projects, are also represented.</p>
         <p>While there may be overlap in content, materials directly related to Furious Flower's decennial conferences on African-American poetry form a separate collection – Furious Flower Poetry Center Conference Records, UA 0018.</p>

               <p>FFPC relies heavily on funding from corporate entities and non-profits to subsidize and off-set the cost of furthering their mission of promoting African-American poetry. As such, this series contains grant proposals and awards (all closed) relating to events, publications, and other projects sponsored by the Furious Flower Poetry Center. Projects represented in this series include "Dream in Color," an online curriculum sponsored by Target that enabled elementary, middle, and high-school students to discover the works of African-American poets; and the publication of Mourning Katrina, an anthology of poems by observers and survivors of Hurricane Katrina. All grant materials were removed from three-ring binders and foldered, maintaining original order.</p>

               <p>Arranged chronologically by event and sub-arranged alphabetically within each event.</p>
               <p>This series is comprised of material relating primarily to the many events, programs, and workshops hosted and sponsored by the Furious Flower Poetry Center. Major events represented in this series include Tell Me Your Names: The Poetry of Lucille Clifton, a week-long seminar held June 14 –June 21, 2009 and 73 Poems for 73 Years: Celebrating the Life of Lucille Clifton, a tribute program held September 21, 2010. Of particular interest are 57 oversize exhibit panels from Among Poets: Lucille Clifton Commemorative Exhibition. This 2012 exhibition held at the Reginald F. Lewis Museum and the Enoch Pratt Free Library, both in Baltimore, Maryland, primarily feature photographs by Lynda Koolish of Lucille Clifton, her contemporaries, and her family and friends. The Center's annual Children's Poetry Camp is also well documented. Researchers should note that there are some files in this series (e.g. materials concerning Oni Lasana Productions) that are not directly related to events held by FFPC. These events are likely ones attended by FFPC staff or documented because they serve as examples of comparable outreach initiatives or similar types of promotion.</p>

               <p>Arranged chronologically according to the order determined in the originating series with the exception of the Among Poets exhibit panels. These items are boxed together beginning with box OV2. Note that these panels are not individually foldered, but rather boxed loose. In this case, the folder titles are actually the title of the exhibit panel itself. Additionally, the date in parentheses represents the date of the original photograph while the item date of 2012 represents the date of the physical exhibit panel.</p>
               <p>The Oversize series consists of five flat oversize boxes and one additional flat folder of materials that do not fit within the standard Hollinger boxes. The Oversize series consists of materials that have been physically removed from their intellectual arrangement within the existing series due to their size and as such, the Oversize series functions only as a container list. Items removed from their original location were replaced with an acid-free separation sheet indicating the items(s) removed to its respective oversize location. The following folder titles are each represented elsewhere in the collection.</p>
