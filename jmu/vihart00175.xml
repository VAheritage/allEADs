      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>In 1865, Privates Jacob William (1836-1865) and Henry H. Otto (1842-1872) were fresh
        recruits who served in Company C, 205th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment in General Ulysses S.
        Grant’s Army of the Potomac. In late March 1865, the Otto brothers were encamped near
        Hancock Station, Virginia in the vicinity of Petersburg. They wrote letters home to their
        parents in Altoona, Pennsylvania in which they described the likelihood of Union victory and
        what they planned to do when they returned home. Grant’s army faced General Robert E. Lee’s
        Army of Northern Virginia, which was entrenched outside of Richmond and Petersburg (June
        1864-March 1865). The formal Siege of Petersburg began in March 1865, and Lee abandoned
        Petersburg in April 1865. Henry was wounded at Fort Stedman on March 25, 1865. Jacob was
        wounded on April 2, 1865 at Fort Sedgwick and died soon after.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Otto Brothers Letters consist of two letters dated March 10 and March 18, 1865. The
        letters are written in the same hand, presumably by the brother with the neatest penmanship,
        though each letter is authored jointly by both brothers. The brothers are writing home to
        their parents in Altoona, Pennsylvania. The letters describe the environment in which their
        regiment is camped in Hancock Station, Virginia. The brothers describe their various
        experiences in nearly becoming involved with a battle. They describe the thousands of deaths
        they witnessed and explain their desire to serve the Union proudly. They explain their
        belief that their deaths would be justified in support of the Union’s cause, as well as
        their disdain and hatred for the rebellion of the southern states.</p>
      <p>The Ottos also explain the conditions of their camp, describing the cold and muddy scenario
        and the inability of both Union and Confederate troops to engage in combat. They also
        describe the constant stream of Confederate deserters which entered into their camp
        daily.</p>
      <p>The Otto brothers conclude their letters with personal notes to friends and family
        remaining in Altoona, asking their parents to relay some information to others.</p>
