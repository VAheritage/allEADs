        <p>Scott Suter often alerted Special Collections to items of interest at Green Valley

        <head>Processing Information</head>
        <p>The photographs were originally housed in a scrapbook and were subsequently removed.
          Black paper residue from the scrapbook pages is still present on the backs of the
          photographs. A description is written on the back of each photograph. Presumably, this
          description accompanied each photograph that was pasted in the scrapbook. A numerical
          identifier (1-43) is also present on the back of each photograph, likely corresponding to
          the order in which the photographs were removed from the scrapbook. This order is retained
          in the collection arrangement.</p>

      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Edith May Fultz Cavendish was born July 8, 1918 to Marvin P. and Mabel Rees Fultz of
        Raphine, Virginia. She attended Madison College and graduated in 1940 with a degree in home
        economics. While a student at Madison College, Cavendish was active in extracurricular
        activities including the Alpha Literary Society, Rural Life Club, Frances Sale Club, Social
        Committee, House Committee Senior Hall, and Y. W. C. A. For at least a portion of her time
        at Madison College, she lived in Spotswood Hall, Room 24. Soon after graduation, Cavendish
        participated as a princess in the October 1940 Turkey Festival Coronation service held at
        Madison College. Cavendish married James H. Bryan of Harrisonburg on May 15, 1943. She
        worked for Harrisonburg Public Schools and Madison College. After Bryan's passing in January
        1972, Cavendish married Richard C. Cavendish. Cavendish died February 17, 2000 and is buried
        at Mt. Carmel Cemetery in Steele's Tavern, Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Edith May Fultz Cavendish Photographs, ca. 1940, include 43 unique black-and-white
        photographs of Madison College while Cavendish (née Fultz) was a student at the school.
        Dormitory life and dormitory interiors, campus buildings, snowscapes, general student and
        social life, and fellow classmate portrait photographs are all captured. A few photographs
        are interspersed that depict locations other than Madison College.</p>
      <p>In addition to the portrait photographs of Madison College students, this collection of
        photographs includes many candid and lighthearted shots of student life and features
        Cavendish with her fellow classmates. A grouping of dormitory photographs capture typical
        student life as it relates to on-campus living. Cavendish and her roommates are shown
        studying, lying in their beds, and posing in bath towels in their dormitory in Spotswood
        Hall. Wilson Hall and other buildings on the perimeter of the quad are also featured in
        these photographs. Photographs of the campus snowscape capture Cavendish with her classmates
        gallivanting in the snow, posing by a recently built snowman, and throwing snowballs. A last
        grouping of photographs feature general student life with Cavendish and her classmates. The
        students are captured posing in groups in front of buildings and other landmarks on campus
        including the kissing rock. Of interest is a photograph of Cavendish with Mary Gregory on
        Class Day. They are wearing heart-shaped aprons and hats and are described as Heart Throbs.
        One particular photograph of Cavendish posing with friends on a tandem bicycle conveys the
        lighthearted nature of this collection.</p>
      <p>Fellow classmates of Cavendish featured in the photographs include but are not limited to
        Mary Gregory, Anne Howell, Margaret Shelton, Eunice Wall, and Katherine Kackley. She refers
        to her close group of friends as "The Gang." A portrait photograph of a man known only as
        Joe is also included.</p>
