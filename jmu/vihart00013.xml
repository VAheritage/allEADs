         <p>Reuben A. Scott and his fiancee and (after September 12,
         1861) his wife, Mary Catherine Saufley (called Mollie) were
         married in their twenties and lived near Port Republic in
         Rockingham County, VA. Mollie was slightly older than Reuben,
         and was well educated, having attended Fair View Academy and
         Miami Seminary in Missouri while living with an uncle there.
         Scott had joined the Confederate forces (private, Company B,
         10th Regiment, Virginia Infantry) at least by April, 1861; was
         wounded in the arm at Chancellorsville in May, 1863; was taken
         prisoner of war at Port Republic in September, 1864; and was
         paroled May 23, 1865. Scott returned to live a prosperous life
         as a farmer at Port Republic, where he died in 1912.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection consists of one Hollinger box of letters
         and a few family records and photos, 1786 to 1912; one 1/2
         Hollinger box of Civil War letter transcripts; and the Hanna
         family Bible. The bulk of the collection is in Series 1, which
         is composed of six folders of Civil War correspondence between
         Reuben A. Scott and his fiancee and (after September 12, 1861)
         his wife, Mary Catherine Saufley (called Mollie). His letters
         describe camp life, preparation for battles, and his
         assignment to search out and arrest deserters. Mollie answered
         with news of family members. Series 1 also contains a few
         documents relevant to the correspondence, such as the April 7,
         1861 note from Mollie's father giving permission to marry, a
         leave of absence for Scott in September, 1861, and copies of
         Scott's muster rolls. Transcripts of letters in Series 1 are
         filed in Box 1A.</p>
         <p>Series 2 contains miscellaneous letters (most from 1850's
         &amp; 60's) from members of the Whitmer, Ewing, Brown, Graham,
         and other families, including the Scott and Saufley families.
         Letters from both R.A.Scott and M.C.Saufley to various
         relatives are filed here. Also filed here are miscellaneous
         documents such as notes of debt, as well as R.A. Scott's will
         and obituary. Transcripts of these letters are also filed in
         Box 1A.</p>
         <p>Series 3, Miscellaneous, contains M.C.Saufley's Daybook,
         1859-1867[?] (prayers, notes on weather, occasional list of
         letters); and a pamphlet, The Soldier's Mission in the Crisis
         of 1861, with a note by R.S.Scott, "found on battlefield..."
         This folder also holds the originals of several clippings that
         were photocopied onto preservation paper for placement with
         the letters they accompanied.</p>
         <p>The photographs in Series 4 consist of three cased photos
         (one daguerreotype) of R.A.Scott; one cased photo of Mollie
         Scott identified and dated by the donor as 1861; and one
         mounted photo of R.S.Scott in his casket. Envelopes are filed
         in Series 5.</p>
