      <head>Bio/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Lodowic Ralph Milbourne was born in Somerset, Maryland on January 18, 1855 and died in
        1906. His wife Virginia Ann Strickler was born in Page County, Virginia in 1867 and died in
        1948. Lodowic began his life in the Baptist church at an early age; he was the grandson and
        nephew of Baptist preachers on the Eastern Shore in Maryland, and he entered Crozer
        Theological Seminary in Upland, Pennsylvania in 1871 to prepare for the Baptist Ministry. He
        first preached in Newport News, Virginia, where he was ordained on July 14, 1881 and went on
        to organize the First Baptist Church in Newport News. In 1884 Lodowic began preaching at the
        Luray Baptist Church in Luray, Virginia where he remained until 1889. During his time in
        Luray he married Virginia Ann Strickler. While living and working in Luray, Lodowic also
        acted as the pastor of a new church in Marksville, (now Stanley) Virginia and helped to
        organize a church in Rileyville, Virginia. In addition to his pastoral duties, he
        contributed to missionary work across the state and was involved in the Shenandoah
        Association. In 1889 Lodowic returned to Maryland and worked as a pastor at churches in
        Rockville and Barnesville.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists of 14 items; thirteen letters from 1886 – 1888 between Lodowic
        Ralph Milbourne and his fiancée Virginia Ann Strickler, and small notebook belonging to
        Strickler that lists the wardrobe expenses for her family from 1893 – 1906 while she is
        traveling and attending Hollins College. All letters are from Milbourne with the exception
        of one response from Strickler. In many of the letters, Lodowic comments on Virginia's
        location; in one she is at Hollins College and in others she is traveling in Chicago,
        Illinois and St. Paul, Minnesota. Lodowic's commentary on Virginia's activities,
        particularly his disapproval at her attending the theater in Chicago, provides insight into
        gender relations during the time.</p>
      <p>The letters show the workings of the Luray Baptist Church community in Luray, Virginia.
        Milbourne primarily discusses religious topics through his interpretation of various
        passages in the Bible and relates day-to-day news of his activities as a preacher in Luray
        and the surrounding area. Milbourne writes about strictures for a proper Christian life,
        sermon topics, visits to members of the town, activities of the missionary Sunbeam Society,
        his interactions as a preacher with various townspeople, and his upcoming marriage to
        Virginia. Strickler's letter to Milbourne addresses religious topics and a petition for a
        prohibition amendment. </p>
