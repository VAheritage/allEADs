      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Charles Triplett O'Ferrall (October 21, 1840 - September 22, 1905) was born in Frederick
        County, Virginia and spent much of his youth residing in Morgan County, Virginia (now West
        Virginia). After his father's death, when O'Ferrall was fifteen, he took over his father's
        position as clerk pro tempore of the circuit court in Morgan County. At age seventeen he was
        elected as the Clerk of the Court and held that position until the outbreak of the Civil War
        in 1861. Although O'Ferrall and Morgan County were supporters of the Union, he joined the
        Virginia Cavalry in 1861 as a private. By 1865 O'Ferrall was an acting colonel, managing the
        forces in the Shenandoah Valley. During the war he sustained eight injuries and during his
        year-long recovery he met his future wife, Annie McLain. The couple was married on Feb. 8,
        1865. After the war O'Ferrall and his wife briefly ran an inn in Staunton, Virginia. In the
        fall of 1868 he enrolled in Washington College (now Washington and Lee) to study law. He
        graduated in August 1869 and settled in Harrisonburg, Virginia where he began his active
        political life. As a democrat he represented Rockingham County in the House of Delegates,
        1871-1873; in 1874 he became the judge for the county court; was a member of the U.S. House
        of Representatives, 1884-1893; and served as governor of Virginia, 1894-1898. In 1898 he
        retired from public and political life. He wrote his autobiography, <emph render="italic"
          >Forty Years of Service</emph>, in 1904 and died a year later in Richmond.</p>
      <p>Mary "Mayme" Clarke Robinson was not as prominent a public figure as C. T. O'Ferrall, but
        she led an important and interesting life nonetheless. At the time of her application to the
        DAR in 1914 she was thirty-nine years old. She was married to Francis A. Robinson and they
        resided in Marshall, Illinois. She was born in Parker City in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania
        in 1875. Francis (Frank) Robinson worked for an oil company so they moved and traveled
        often. She and Frank had two daughters, Isabelle and Helen Jane. Isabelle is the
        grand-mother of the donor, Margaret Reed. Frank passed away in the 1930s of heart disease;
        Mayme never remarried. As a widow Mayme (also known as "Dee Dee") lived in Westfield, and
        Chautauqua, NY, and Atlantic City, New Jersey. She would often visit and stay with friends
        in different places for a year or so. She spent the last years of her life in a nursing home
        in Erie, Pennsylvania. She passed away in the middle to late 1960's when she was in her
        90s.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Margaret Reed Collection, 1902-1914, consists of three items, with thirteen pages
        total, in one legal-sized folder. The items included are a hand written letter from Charles
        T. O'Ferrall to Mayme Clarke Robinson, a typed transcript of this letter composed by
        Isabelle Robinson Reed, daughter of Mayme, and a photocopy of Mayme's application to the
        Walter Burdick chapter of the DAR. The letter provides a genealogical history of the
        O'Ferrall family and its extensions, it is seven pages in length on four sheets of paper;
        the original pages three and four are missing. A handwritten surrogate for page three is
        provided. The typed transcript is also missing page four. The application to the DAR is four
        pages in length and provides genealogical information about the applicant dating back to her
        great-grandfather James Clarke who served as a Quartermaster under Captain Fox in the
        American Revolution, and a branch of Charles T. O'Ferrall's family.</p>
