         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Claudia Frazier Bailey Photographs, 1964, consist of six photographs of Bailey and her friends during Bailey's senior year as Madison College. Five of the photographs include Bailey (usually recognized by her "cats-eye" glasses), depicting either a large get-together of friends or hanging out in her dorm room. One photograph depicts three women posing in the snow. Photographs of note include one where Bailey is smoking, wearing sunglasses, and playing the bongos while her friends are laid out on the floor, and another where Bailey and a friend are doing a stunt in which the friend is standing on Bailey's bent knees.</p>
