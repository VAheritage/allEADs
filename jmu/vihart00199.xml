      <p>Katherine (alternately Katharine) "Katie" Virginia Winfrey was born on December 4, 1891 to
        Elisha William and Roberta Jones Winfrey. Elisha Winfrey was a prominent Baptist minister
        and author in Culpeper, Virginia. Winfrey graduated from the State Normal School and
        Industrial School for Women at Harrisonburg in 1912 with a "professional" degree in
        education, indicating that she had previously completed four years at a "first class" high
        school followed by two years at the State Normal and Industrial School for Women. During her
        time at college, Winfrey participated in the Tennis Club, Professional Club, and the Lee
        Literary Society. Winfrey lived with family members in Culpeper until her death on April 6,
        1940. She is buried in Culpeper's Masonic Cemetery.</p>

        School. The scrapbook itself is entitled "The Girl Graduate: Her Own Book" and was designed
        and illustrated by Louise Perrett and Sarah K. Smith of the Reilly and Britton Company in
        Chicago.</p>
