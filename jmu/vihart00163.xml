            <p>The 1984-1985 and 1984-1985, 1988-1989 scrapbooks were donated by Anne Harter in July
               2010. The 1991-1994 scrapbook was donated by Dale Harter, son of Anne Harter, via his
               niece Elizabeth Payne in March 2019.</p>

            <head>Processing Information</head>
            <p>In order to streamline the process of applying collection numbers, Special
               Collections staff completed a large-scale renumbering campaign in 2017-2019. <emph
                  render="bold">This collection was previously cataloged as SC 5060.</emph>
            </p>
            <p>During this time, the collection was also minimally reprocessed in order to
               incorporate a third scrapbook which was donated in 2019 and better stabilize the
               materials through physical rehousing. The intellectual arrangement, including folder
               titles, were retained. During initial processing in 2013, the scrapbooks, which
               presumably were donated as bound objects, were inexplicably disbound and
               disassembled. The photographs, printed material, and assorted ephemera comprising the
               scrapbooks were removed from their respective scrapbooks, foldered into chronological
               or topical groupings, and described at the item level. Given that item-level
               discription is a highly unusual practice for printed ephemera and photographs
               contained within or removed from a scrapbook, the materials contained within the
               1991-1994 scrapbook were not individually described. The description created for the
               1984-1985 and 1988-1989 scrapbooks was retained.</p>

         <p>It is assumed that the materials from the disbound scrapbooks are in the order in which
            they were removed from their respective scrapbooks. The third scrapbook (1991-1994)
            remains bound and the materials therein are arranged in their original order.</p>
