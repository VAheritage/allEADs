</head>
<p>Emily Lewis Lee (Mrs. Luther Lee) was a 1943 Home Economics graduate. She was appointed to serve on Madison College's Board of Visitors in 1980-1983 where she chaired the Education and Student Life Committee
and the Alumni Relations Committee. She also served as Secretary for the Alumni Association's Board of Directors receiving the "Distinguished Alumni Service Award" in 1981. Mrs. Lee was her class' "fund agent" in
the late 1970s and is largely responsible for procuring funding for the University's processional mace.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection documents Emily Lee's work with James Madison University's Alumni Association and the Board of Visitors. Much of her correspondence includes letters to her fellow alumnae from the class of 1943.
Her awards, appointments and accompanying news clippings are included as are booklets compiled for alumni reunion weekends and homecomings. Of special interest is the history of the university's processional mace,
a gift of the Class of 1943, presented to the University on Founder's Day, 1979.
</p>
<p>Series 1, Correspondence, 1953- (1973-1983)-2001 and undated, contains letters mainly regarding reunion planning, plus Lee's annual "Lee News" bulletins for 1981, 1983-1991, with similar reports in 1997, 1999
and 2001.
</p>
<p>Series 2, Scrapbooks and Guestbooks, contains two large scrapbooks largely of color photographs compiled either for or after the 35th, 40th and 45th Reunions of the Class of '43. The first of these has a small
selection of black &amp; white photographs from the 1940s. The three smaller guestbooks contain signatures from alumni receptions and luncheons dating from 1956-1989. The first of these books belonged to the
Madison Alumni Richmond Chapter, and the other two are most likely from on-campus alumni events.
</p>
<p>Series 3, Ephemera, contains a clipping about Mrs. Lee from the "Alumni Bulletin" Vol. 2, No. 1; the "Home Economics Alumni Newletter," No. 17, December 1981 with front page coverage of Mrs. Lee receiving an
alumni service award; reunion booklets from the 1978 and 1979; and an undated alumni publication, "From Blue Stone Hill to You," among other programs and flyers.
</p>
<p>Series 4, University Mace, concerns the university's processional mace and includes a letter from the artist, Prof. Ron Wyancko, newsclippings, fundraising for the Mace Fund, and notes on the Founder's Day
processional 1978-1979.
</p>
<p>Series 5, Photographs, contains a 5x7" black and white print of Emily Lee presenting the mace to President Carrier in 1979, an 8x10" of her reunion group ca. 1983 and four snap shots of awards and reunion
banquets from the early 1980s.
