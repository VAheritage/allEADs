      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Edward D. Townsend was born in Boston in 1817. He graduated West Point in 1837, served in
        the Second Seminole War (Florida War), and eventually reached the rank of captain in 1848.
        Townsend served throughout the war in the Adjutant Generals office. Townsend would go on
        after the war to achieve the rank of brigadier general in 1869. He died in Washington, DC in
        1893.</p> <p>At the time General Orders No. 190 was issued in June of 1863, the Union war effort
        was in a precarious position. The important Union victory at Antietam in the fall of 1862
        had been followed by little progress in defeating Confederate forces in Virginia. To
        maintain a steady income of new recruits, the United States Congress passed the Enrollment
        Act which was enacted on March 3, 1863. This act required every male citizen and immigrants
        who had filed for citizenship between ages twenty and forty-five to enroll. The Enrollment
        Act proved to be unpopular, and the issuing of General Order No.190 was intended to aid in
        recruiting for the Regular Army. The order offered bounties for enlistments for up to five
        years of service, detailing a $2 premium on enlistment, plus $13 advance pay, and almost
        $400 bounty to new soldiers, spread out at $50 per year. Three weeks after the issuing of
        these new premiums and expectations of the war to continue until 1868, riots broke out in
        New York over the demand for new soldiers to fight in the war, known as the New York Draft
        Riots.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>General Order No. 190, 1863, consists of a printed copy of the order. The order directed
        the parameters and amounts for the pay of new recruits into the Union Regular Army. It goes
        on to detail the periods in which recruits were to be paid their bounties for enlisting
        throughout their terms of service, extending to the expiration of their service after four
        years with a maximum total of $402. The document is signed, in type, by Assistant Adjutant
        General E. D. Townsend. The left edge of the sheet is irregular where it was removed from a
        binding.</p>
