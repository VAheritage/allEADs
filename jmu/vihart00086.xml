<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection consists of legal and business documents from Rockingham, Augusta, and Page Counties from 1802 to 1901. It also contains herbal recipes and other documents used by the donor in his 1995 book,
Shenandoah Voices. The collector's theme was to acquire documents that, by virtue of the person who signed it, or the letterhead it bore, or the printer, or the location of the event, or some other characteristic,
had distinct and particular significance to Shenandoah Valley history. Accompanying the collection are notes by the donor on most of the individual documents.
