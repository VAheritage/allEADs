         <head>Administrative History</head>
         <p>In 1994, James Madison University, under the leadership and direction of professor of English Dr. Joanne V. Gabbin, hosted the first Furious Flower Poetry Conference entitled A Revolution in African American Poetry. This Conference, dedicated to acclaimed poet Gwendolyn Brooks, featured scholars, critics, and the most accomplished and esteemed poets of the time including Nikki Giovanni, Rita Dove, Sonia Sanchez, Michael S. Harper, Haki Madhubuti, and Gwendolyn Brooks herself. The name "Furious Flower" is derived from Brooks' poem Second Sermon on the Warpland in which she writes:</p>
         <p>The time
cracks into furious flower. Lifts its face
all unashamed. And sways in wicked grace.</p>
         <p>Many who participated in the inaugural Furious Flower conference had their roots in the Black Arts Movement. The Black Arts Movement emerged in the wake of the Black Power Movement of the 1960s and 1970s and was comprised of politically motivated black visionaries, poets, artists, dramatists, musicians, and writers. Due to the success of the 1994 Furious Flower Conference, the Furious Flower Poetry Center (FFPC) was established in 1999 and the Conference became a decennial event, held every ten years. The subsequent conferences were Regenerating the Black Poetic Tradition (2004) and Seeding the Future of African American Poetry. Conference programming is comprised of concerts, readings, roundtable and panel discussions, and paper presentations.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Furious Flower Poetry Center Conference Records, 1970-2009, undated, bulk 1992-2005, consisting of 6.03 cubic feet (9 Hollinger boxes, 1 oversize Hollinger box, 1 record storage box, 1 rolled storage container, 1 oversize flat folder), is comprised of the materials related to the decennial Furious Flower poetry conferences, beginning with the inaugural conference in 1994. A significant portion of the records include logistical and planning documentation for each conference as well as marking and promotional items. These materials are comprised of calls for papers, contracts, correspondence, address lists, ticket requests, travel, transportation, and lodging reservations, and menus. The records include nontraditional items as well. Of interest are exhibit panels (text labels and images) describing and depicting the participants of the 1994 conference. Magnesium letterpress die plates used to print a limited edition portfolio Furious Flower: A Revolution in African American Poetry, a special collection of 23 poems selected by poets (who participated in the 1994 conference) to represent their work, are included. Five silk banners that adorned the Wilson Hall auditorium during the 2004 and 2014 conferences are contained included. In general, material types are similar across Series 1 and 2.</p>
         <p>While there may be overlap in content, materials directly related to general organizational activities of the Furious Poetry Center form a separate collection – Furious Flower Poetry Center Records, UA 0017.</p>

         <head>Arrangement</head>
         <p>The collection is arranged into four series:</p>
         <p>Series 1: 1994 Conference, 1970-2009
Series 2: 2004 Conference, 2002-2007
Series 3: Media
Series 4: Oversize, 1994-2004</p>
         <p>As a result of their inherent chronological series arrangement, Series 1 and 2 are arranged alphabetically with the exception of the Exhibit of Participants materials and the magnesium letterpress die plates in Series 1 which located at the end of the series due to their size. Series 3: Media has no particular arrangement as the materials are undergoing digitization as of August 2016. Series 4: Oversize is arranged by size.</p>

         <p>Furious Flower Poetry Center donated a box of rolled posters in cardboard tubes, all identical, from the 1994 and 2004 conferences – each cardboard tube contained one 1994 poster and one 2004 poster. Due to duplication elsewhere in this collection, only one set of posters was retained. They were flattened and placed in the Oversize series.</p>

               <p>Arranged alphabetically with the exception of the Exhibit of Participants materials and the magnesium letterpress die plates which are located at the end of the series due to their size. Note that the numbering system for the letterpress die plates is sequential based on each poem's order in the publication Furious Flower: A Revolution in African American Poetry. As such the first folder/four-flap enclosure in box nine is labeled 9:21b. This is the plate for page two of the 21st poem in the publication.
Materials in this series primarily document the planning and implementation of the 1994 Furious Flower Poetry Conference: A Revolution in African American Poetry. Records include travel and lodging reservations, correspondence with participating poets, financial documentation and budgets, and mailing lists. Marketing and promotional items such as posters and brochures are included. Conference evaluations completed by attendees and folders labeled "Positive Responses" document the overwhelming success of the conference. Of particular interest are exhibit components from the 1994 conference that include text labels and images of each participating poet. The photographs for these panels were taken by C. B. Claiborne. Copy 225 of 300 of Furious Flower: A Revolution in African American Poetry is located in box 2, folder 5. The magnesium letterpress die plates used to print this collection of poetry are also included here. Each plate is individually housed in a four-flap enclosure and then boxed in order of appearance in the publication.</p>

               <p>Arranged alphabetically.</p>
               <p>Materials in this series primarily document the planning and implementation of the 2004 Furious Flower Poetry Conference: Regenerating the Black Poetic Tradition. Records include travel and lodging reservations, correspondence with participating poets, financial documentation and budgets, and mailing lists. Marketing and promotional items such as posters and brochures are included. During the 2004 conference, notable African American scholars including Tony Bolden, Hilary Holladay, and Monifa Love conducted interviews with presenting conference poets including Houston Baker, Rita Dove, and Tony Medina. The corresponding transcripts are included and are particularly significant to African American poetry scholarship. Of particular interest is congratulatory correspondence and RSVP regrets for the 2004 conference from Julian Bond, Governor Mark Warner, Senator George Allen, the office of President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry, President and CEO of the NAACP Kweisi Mfume, and many others. Some of these letters were printed in the official conference program. Also of interest are evaluations completed by conference attendees. Five silk banners used to decorate the Wilson Hall auditorium during the conference are included in this series. The banners are rolled onto dowels and housed in a rolled storage container. Currently, the silk banners may only be requested (in writing) by Furious Flower Poetry Center staff.</p>

               <p>Arranged by size.</p>
               <p>The Oversize series consists of one oversize box and two oversize folders – one smaller than the other. The larger oversize folder contains conference posters separated from their intellectual arrangement within the existing series due to their common size and includes a separate set of posters donated in a cardboard tube. The smaller oversize folder, comprised of photographs and separated from Series 2, 2004 Conference, Box 11: Folder 13), is housed physically within the larger oversize folder; both are housed in Map Case 1:3. The photographs are foldered separately due to their size and inherent preservation needs of the material. The rolled storage container contains the five silk banners used in the 2004 and 2014 Furious Flower Poetry Conference. Currently, the silk banners may only be requested (in writing) by Furious Flower Poetry Center staff.</p>
