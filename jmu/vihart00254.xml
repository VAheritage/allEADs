      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Hugh Lafferty Gallaher, born in Lebanon, Pennsylvania in 1812, spent most of his life in
        Waynesboro, Virginia. Gallaher married Elizabeth Bowen of Shepherdstown, Virginia, and in
        1848 moved their 4 sons and 3 daughters to a prominent home, "Rose Hall," located near the
        Virginia Central Railroad in Waynesboro. Gallaher owned farms, a mill, and a tannery in and
        around Waynesboro. His loyalty during the Civil War was a subject of controversy, as he was
        known to entertain both Union and Confederate soldiers in his home. In 1871 he petitioned
        the Southern Claims Commission that he should be reimbursed for $32,587.50 worth of
        property, purportedly taken by U.S. troops to benefit the U.S. Army, invoking a provision
        intended to reimburse Southerners who had remained loyal to the Union during the war. The
        claim was challenged and denied, and further investigation revealed that Gallaher had served
        as a blockade runner and privateer for the Confederacy.</p>
      <p>Sons, William Bowen (1840-1911) and Dewitt Clinton (D.C.) Gallaher were born in
        Shepherdstown, Virginia (now West Virginia) and attended Waynesboro Academy in Waynesboro as
        youth. Both fought for the Confederate army and William was present at the battle of First
        Manassas in 1861. William B. worked as an engineer and Dewitt went on to become an attorney.
        William married Amelia Frances Briscoe (1845-1911), a member of a prominent Maryland family.
        The family lived at an estate called "Springdale," near Waynesboro. </p>
      <p>Juliet Hite Gallaher (1871-1951), oldest daughter of William B. and Amelia Briscoe
        Gallaher, served as Vice President of the Waynesboro chapter of the Daughters of the
        Confederacy, and appeared to have written several articles for Good Housekeeping magazine in
        the 1910s. </p>
      <p>Capt. John L. Briscoe (1836-1900), brother to Amelia Briscoe Gallaher and Juliet B. Miller,
        served in the Confederate army as an Assistant Quartermaster in Mahone's Division.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>These papers relate to members of the extended family of Lieutenant William Bowen Gallaher
        (1840-1911) and Amelia Frances Briscoe Gallaher (1845-1911), and document their involvement
        with the Waynesboro Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, Maryland Line
        Confederate Soldiers Home, and the Grand Camp C. V. Department of Virginia. It includes two
        personal letters from Virginia governor John Letcher to Hugh Lafferty Gallaher, written in
        1858, before Letcher assumed the office of Virginia governor. </p>
      <p>An 1864 account by M.J. Baldwin lists expenses charged to Amelia Briscoe, then 19 years
        old, presumably for her education. It contains line items for Washing, French, Latin, Music
        and Use of Piano. </p>
      <p>The papers contain two letters from attorney and Virginia governor John Letcher to Hugh L.
        Gallaher (father of William Bowen Gallaher). In an 1858 letter, written in Lexington,
        Virginia, Letcher thanks Hugh L. Gallaher for the role his son took in relaying information
        about his nomination for governor at the "Petersburg Convention." A handwritten note on the
        back of the letter by Juliet Hite Gallaher states that "Papa rode horse back to Lexington to
        notify him of his electionâ¦exchanged horses." </p>
      <p>The papers include two letters from William H. Pope, Superintendent of the Maryland Line
        Confederate Soldiers Home regarding the condition of Captain John Lamar Briscoe, a
        Confederate veteran and brother to Amelia Frances Briscoe Gallaher. One 1884 letter is
        addressed to Briscoe's sister Mrs. J.B. Miller (Juliet B.) of Germantown, Maryland, and
        another written in 1900 is addressed to Mr. D.C. Gallaher in Charleston, West Virginia.</p>
      <p>An 1887 letter from H.H. Stuart to a William W. Corcoran Esquire, chairman of the Joint
        Commission for the Completion of the Washington Monument, recommends that William Gallaher
        be appointed as a superintendent of the construction of the Washington Monument. Stuart
        writes that Gallaher has been a "large contractor on various railroads and canals, and has
        had much experience, especially in the construction of masonry."</p>
      <p>Other documents relate to the Elliot G. Fishburne Chapter of the United Daughters of the
        Confederacy in Waynesboro. One 1910 letter is addressed to Juliet Hite Gallaher, Vice
        President of the Waynesboro Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, from Julian
        Pratt, of Grand Camp Confederate Veterans, Department of Virginia. Another document lists of
        members of the Waynesboro Chapter, dated 1886 â 1925, with their related veteran and their
        rank/station. It appears that deceased members were crossed out.</p>
