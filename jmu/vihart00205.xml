      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Ezra M. Minnick Sr. (1865-1939) was a native of Timberville, Virginia. He married Joanna C.
        Bowman (1861-1934), daughter of David Bowman, on April 24, 1888 at the bride's father's home
        north of Timberville. They had four children, but only two survived into adulthood – Ezra M.
        Minnick Jr. (1890-1973) and Millard B. Minnick (1902-1979). Minnick was engaged in farming
        as his primary occupation, but was also appointed fertilizer inspector for the 7th
        Congressional District in March 1900. By 1910, Minnick was listed in the federal census as a
        merchant of farm implements, but eventually went back to farming exclusively. Minnick was an
        active member of the Lutheran church, specifically Rader's Lutheran Church on the outskirts
        of Timberville. He served his local congregation in many leadership capacities as a member
        of the executive committee and secretary of the church council. Minnick was also elected
        corresponding secretary of the Evangelical Lutheran Tennessee Synod at the annual convention
        in August 1902. He is buried in Rader's Lutheran Church Cemetery.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Ezra M. Minnick Sr. Diary, 1900, is comprised of one Excelsior Diary with daily entries
        by Timberville, Virginia farmer and government inspector, Ezra M. Minnick Sr. General
        subject matter includes weather reports, local and state politics, business dealings, and
        personal news and events.</p>
      <p>The bound pocket diary, sold by William F. Murphy's Sons Stationers in Philadelphia,
        includes printed calendars, moon cycles, information on domestic and foreign currency,
        interest tables, and "valuable information for business men." Minnick completed diary
        entries for each day in 1900. On most days Minnick travelled into the town of Timberville to
        conduct business. He commented daily on weather patterns, made regular mentions of visitors
        to his home and visiting he did, described his weekly church attendance, and local deaths,
        marriages, other major community happenings including court days. He discussed his
        interactions with community members including Jonathan Calhoun, Casper Tussing, William J.
        Arehart, and Peter J. Knupp.</p>
      <p>After Minnick was appointed to fertilizer inspector of the 7th District in March 1900, many
        of his diary entries discuss his duties and responsibilities related to that position. For
        example, on Wednesday, May 23, 1900 Minnick was "This morning in Winchester at the Taylor
        House…then went about the place to see the different Fertilizer agents as to how much
        fertilizer they had received." Entries also include meetings with George B. Keezell
        (1854-1931), member of the Virginia Senate, and George W. Koiner (1852-1939), commissioner
        of agriculture in Virginia. Minnick made frequent mentions of his son Ezra Jr., wife Joanna,
        and 16-year-old live-in servant Mamie in his diary entries.</p>
      <p>Other entries of note include:</p>
      <p><emph render="italic">Tuesday, January 9, 1900</emph> – "Went to Mt. Jackson and attended
        the annual meeting off the stock holders of Mt. Jackson Natl. Bank. I rode in superintendent
