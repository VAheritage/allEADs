        <p>Acquiring the collection was suggested to Dr. Mark Peterson of James Madison University
          Special Collections, by Dr. Andrew Witmer, history professor at JMU. Dr. Witmer intended
          to include the collection in his History Harvest project but was unable to do so because
          of time constraints. Dr. Peterson contacted the church and, with the help of the church’s
          secretary, gathered the collection for digitization in 2012.</p>

        <head>Processing Information</head>
        <p>The collection was lent to JMU Special Collections for digitization in 2012 and materials
          were returned to Bethlehem United Church of Christ in 2013. JMU Special Collections
          originally digitized the materials and processed the images using Adobe Photoshop
          Elements. Images were re-processed from 2014-2015 by JMU Digital Collections using Adobe
          Photoshop and Adobe Bridge. PDF files were created using Adobe Acrobat Pro X. Please note
          that the contrast was adjusted on some images to increase the legibility of the original
          scans. Additionally, some images do not capture the complete content of the item. JMU
          Digital Collections has made best efforts to provide the clearest and most complete image
          possible from the original. </p>

      <head>Biographical Information </head>
      <p>Bethlehem United Church of Christ, commonly called Bethlehem Stone Church, is located in
        Tenth Legion, just south of New Market, Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley. It was founded in
        1844 when Jacob Martz deeded a parcel of land in Tenth Legion to be used as the site for a
        place of worship. A committee of trustees consisting of John Cowan, Jacob Cowan, Martin
        Martz, Dorilas Martz, and Jackson Martz was then appointed to superintend the building of
        the church and Jeremiah Clemons, a local stonemason, was chosen for construction. The church
        was completed in 1845 and the stone church remained the sole house of worship until 1952
        when a second church building was constructed. </p>

      <p>During the Civil War the church was used to house Confederate prisoners and also as a
        makeshift military hospital. The structure was badly damaged during the war and was not
        repaired until the 1880s. Please see the item titled Written Histories, 1948-1995 in the
        Church History Materials series for a detailed history of the church and the stone
        structure. After the Civil War the church was used by several different denominations
        including the Christian Church, the United Brethren in Christ, and the German Baptist
        Church. The congregation worshipped in the Stone Church until 1952 when a larger brick
        church was built on the land beside it. In 1981 Bethlehem Stone Church was added to the
        Virginia Landmarks Register and in 1985 to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2008
        restoration began to the old stone church and was completed in 2011. The structure is now
        used for special events.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>The Bethlehem Stone Church Records consist of 47 pdf files that contain 1.08 GB of material
        that date from the church’s first year of operation in 1844 through 2011. The records
        document church business, governance, and day-to-day operations, as well as the history of
        the church. Materials include meeting minutes, financial records, attendance and membership
        records, church programming materials, photographs, and scrapbooks. The earliest documents
        in the collection include a record of the first organization of the church in August of 1844
        and a list of original members. Also contained in the collection are materials documenting
        the activities of the Sunday School as well as the Women’s Fellowship, a women’s group
        within the church. Church history materials include scrapbooks as well as written histories
        that provide details on the institutional history of the church and the Tenth Legion area.

          <abstract>Items in this series consist of ledgers and notebooks that document the
            administrative functions of the church and span from the earliest written records in
            1844 to 1979. The earliest record book, Church Record Book 1, contains documentation of
            the first organization of the church in August of 1844, and lists the original members
            separately as male, female, and colored members. Church Record Book 2 contains the
            copied text of the original deed of Bethlehem Church from September 1844. Materials
            within this series contain information related to church business including membership
            lists, records of deaths, names of elected officials, financial records, and meeting
            minutes. Financial records in this series include accounts of payments made to the
            pastor’s salary and records for various collections taken within the church. Most items
            have labels taped to the cover of the ledger or notebook that indicate dates and
            contents. It is unknown when these notes were written, or by whom. </abstract>

          <abstract>Materials in this series document the functions of the women’s group within the
            church. This group was called Ladies Aid or Ladies Aid Society in the earliest records
            up to 1959. Beginning in 1960 within their own records and in other records it is called
            Women’s Fellowship or Women’s Fellowship Committee. The bulk of the materials in this
            series are the program booklets from 1965-1974 that list officers and committee members
            and outline monthly assignments for the year. Also included in this series are meeting
            minutes from 1936-1976 (not inclusive) that detail the activities of the group and also
            include some financial records. The notebook titled “History of Women’s Fellowship of
            Valley of Virginia” details the history of women's missionary work in the Virginia
            Valley Central Congregational Christian Conference as well as the history of the
            Conference in general.</abstract>

          <abstract>This series documents the organization and activities of the Sunday School of
            the church. The Sunday School consisted of classes for children and young adults in the
            church with Bible instruction and singing. In some of the earliest records the school is
            referred to as Sabbath School, and as “S. S” throughout the records. Ledgers include
            attendance lists and lists of elected officers for the Sunday School Committee as well
            as record of the activities of each Sunday School meeting, including hymns and Bible
            readings. Other contents of the ledgers include financial records and lists of
            literature and materials purchased for the Sunday School. Note that the earliest Sunday
            School records are located in the Administrative Records series, in Church Record Book
            3, 1883-1894.</abstract>

              calendar="gregorian"> 1875-2011</unitdate></unittitle>
          <abstract>Materials in this series document the history of the church. Items include
            scrapbooks, newspaper clippings, typed and hand-written institutional histories of the
            church, photographs of the church and church members, and church programs. Many of the
            typed or written histories of the church were compiled for a 150th anniversary
            celebration of the old stone church held on June 4, 1995. These histories contain
            information about the history of religious worship in the Tenth Legion area prior to
            1844, going back to the early 1700s. There are also genealogical materials relating to
            the Martz family, who deeded the land for the church in 1844. Other materials also
            relate to the 1952 construction of a new church building. See item titled Church
            History, 1944-2011 for a list of church pastors from 1844-2008. Note that there are
            multiple instances of duplicate materials contained within this series. </abstract>
