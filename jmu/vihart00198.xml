      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Eva Rooshup was born in Wisconsin on May 25, 1899. She graduated from John Marshall High
        School in Richmond, Virginia in 1917 and afterward enrolled at the State Normal School for
        Women at Harrisonburg. Kohl participated in the college's Home Economics Club, Y.W.C.A., and
        the Lee Literary Society. She also served as a corporal in Company B of the college
        battalion. Classmates regarded her as friendly, energetic, and good-natured with "sparkling
        brown eyes." At some point during her time at the State Normal School for Women, Kohl was
        afflicted with the Spanish flu. She graduated in the spring of 1919.</p>
      <p>Eva Rooshup married Elmer Kohl in Richmond, Virginia on September 9, 1920. They were living
        in Detroit, Michigan in 1921. By 1930, Eva and Elmer Kohl were living in Varina, Virginia,
        southeast of Richmond. In 1940, they still resided in Varina with their three children
        Alberta, Phyllis, and J. Preston Kohl, as well as two lodgers and a cousin.</p>
      <p>Kohl died on July 15, 2000 and was buried in the Varina Episcopal Church Cemetery in Varina
        Grove, Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Eva Rooshup Kohl Papers, 1919, 1971, contain paper memorabilia belonging to Eva Rooshup
        Kohl from her time as a student at the State Normal School for Women in Harrisonburg,
        Virginia.</p>
      <p>The items include a college battalion arm band accompanied by a note presumably written by
        Kohl describing the band's provenance, a place card, a 1919 receipt from the college for
        money paid toward board, a handwritten note from physiology professor Mary Iscah Bell, an
        invitation to the 1919 Alumnae Banquet, and a small program for the 1919 Class Day
        activities. A homecoming mailer sent by James Madison University Alumni Association in the
        winter of 1971 is also included.</p>
