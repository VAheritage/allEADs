        <p>This material was originally in a three ring binder, with photos attached to black
          construction paper and captions typed on separate slips of paper. Approval was secured
          from Scott Suter, Historical Society Curator, for purposes of long-term preservation, to
          remove photos from the black paper and reaffix on acid-free bond paper with captions typed
          as they appeared in the original scrapbook. In the original scrapbook, some photographs
          were placed behind other photographs; in the new arrangement all photographs are affixed
          individually. Newspaper clippings were reproduced on acid-free paper.</p>
        <p>In order to streamline the process of applying collection numbers, Special Collections
          staff completed a large-scale renumbering campaign in the spring of 2017. <emph

      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Civilian Conservation Corps was created as a part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal
        in 1933 and operated until 1942 to provide employment during the Depression to young,
        unmarried men ages 18-25. All work related to the conservation of natural resources and
        resulted in the creation of the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. Camp NIRA, named after
        the National Industrial Recovery Administration, was established on June 20, 1933 and was
        the third camp created in the Shenandoah National Park along Skyline Drive. It was located
        near Spotswood, one of the main entrances to the Park, along a south slope and protected by
        Bald Face Mountain. John V. Coxe, known as "Jack," was a part of Company 1387 at Camp NIRA
        during the years 1933-1934. Some of the projects completed by Company 1387 include the
        creation of parking overlooks, development of the South River Picnic Grounds, construction
        of the Dean Mountain reservoir, and the creation of trails and roads for fighting fires.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The John V. Coxe Papers, 1933 – 1987, consist of one disbound scrapbook of materials
        separated into three folders. The collection includes captioned photographs, newspaper
        clippings, and a few documents consisting of camp reports and letters. The collection
        provides considerable evidence relating to the history of the C.C.C., particularly that of
        Camp #3 in the Shenandoah National Park. The scrapbook was created by John Coxe, known as
        Jack, and documents daily life and work within Camp NIRA, Civilian Conservation Corps
        (C.C.C.) Camp #3, Company 1387, from 1933-1934. The newspaper clippings date primarily from
        the 1980s and feature interviews from former C.C.C. members, including John Coxe. Other
        clippings include information relating to various aspects of the C.C.C. and C.C.C. members
        from the 1930s through the 1980s. Photographs document daily life in the camp, and show men
        working on various projects within the Shenandoah National Park. A few photographs document
        a C.C.C reunion in the 1980s. Also included are a few pictures of President Roosevelt on a
        tour of inspection of the C.C.C. camps. Documents include camp reports from Camp NIRA and
        correspondence to and from John Coxe regarding employment after his time in the C.C.C.</p>
