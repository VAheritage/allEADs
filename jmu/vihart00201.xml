      <p>Annie Vergilia Cleveland (1847-1916) and Elizabeth Pendleton Cleveland (1867-1958) were
        sisters, and they both became faculty members at the State Normal and Industrial School for
        Women in Harrisonburg, Virginia in 1909. Annie served as an assistant instructor of English
        and French until her death in 1916. Elizabeth served as the head of the English department
        and later the French department until her retirement in 1943.</p>
      <p>The Cleveland sisters were born in Kent's Store, Virginia to Mary Elizabeth Perkins and
        Thomas Cleveland. Annie and Elizabeth both attended Hollins University in Roanoke, Virginia.
        Before coming to Harrisonburg, Annie taught public and private school in Fluvanna County,
        while Elizabeth taught at Hollins University and at Central University and Ouachita Baptist
        University, both in Arkansas. While teaching at the State Normal and Industrial School for
        Women, Elizabeth earned her master's degree from the University of Virginia (1927) and saw
        to the founding several long-running student organizations: the Lee Literary Society, Lanier
        Literary Society, and The Schoolma'am (now Bluestone) yearbook. The dormitory Junior Hall
        was renamed Cleveland Hall in 1957 in honor of Elizabeth Cleveland.</p>
      <p>Neither Annie nor Elizabeth had children, but they did have numerous nieces and nephews.
        One of whom was Cleveland Sadler, the son of Annie and Elizabeth's sister Mary E. Cleveland
        Sadler. He is featured with other young relatives in photographs in the collection. Also
        featured are nieces Vergilia Pendleton Sadler (1890-1965) and Mary Emma Sadler who graduated
        from the State Normal and Industrial School for Women in 1911 and 1912, respectively.
        Vergilia Sadler returned to the university to acquire her graduate degree in 1921.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Cleveland Family Papers, 1880-1958, are comprised primarily of photographs of Elizabeth
        and Annie Cleveland and other Cleveland family members. Additional materials include
        documents related to the deaths of Annie Cleveland and Elizabeth Cleveland. Photocopies of
        box labels pertaining to Cleveland Sadler are also included.</p>
      <p>The 16 black-and-white photographs of Elizabeth Cleveland feature professional portraits
        and group shots. Most of the photographs are undated, but likely date from the
        late-nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century. Some photographs feature Elizabeth
        with family members (Lucinda Gillespie, Margaret Gillespie, Lucinda Shepherd) and others
        feature her with classmates or colleagues from Hollins University. Many of the photographs
        are inscribed with the subjects' identities. Other persons featured include Etta Moore,
        Genevieve Rudd, Roe Hurt, Leila Turner, Joe Turner, Robert Hollins Alberti, Sadie White, and
        Alice Kelsey. Photograph studios featured include André Studio; Dean's Studio and Gitchell's
        Studio in Harrisonburg; Maury in Salem, Virginia; Fred Walter in Staunton, Virginia; Thuss
        and Bingham in Memphis, Tennessee; P. G. Pickerill in Little Rock, Arkansas; and
        Merin-Baliban in Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>A photograph of Annie Cleveland features her seated in a wheelchair surrounded by four
        children. The inscription on the back of the photograph indicates that these children are
        her nieces and nephews Vergilia Sadler, Mary Sadler, Cleveland Sadler, and Hugh Sadler. The
        photograph is undated, but likely dates to the late-nineteenth century. There are also four
        photographs ranging in date from 1909 to 1954 featuring Vergilia Sadler. In two of these,
        both dated 1909, Vergilia is dressed as a Brethren minister for the play <emph
          render="italic">Cohee and Tuckahoe</emph>.</p>
      <p>Documents related to Annie Cleveland's death in 1916 include one single-sheet program from
        her memorial service on January 14, 1917, as well as a packet of typed papers and a bound
        pamphlet recapping the events and speeches delivered at the memorial service. The pamphlet
        contains speeches delivered by university president Julian Burruss, history faculty member
        John Wayland, student Zola Hubbard, Reverend W.F. Watson, and Mr. C.A. Mason as well as
        remembrances by Vera B. Pettit, Floyd W. King, Bettie L. Gray, Emma D. Thomas, Mrs. N.B.
        Gay, and Willie M. Shiflett. Excerpts from Annie Cleveland's diary are also included in the
        pamphlet. An 1880 article written by Annie Cleveland entitled "My Father" is also included.
        Two newspaper clippings of Elizabeth's 1958 obituary are included.</p>
      <p>Lastly, the collection contains photocopies of box labels that housed <emph render="italic"
          >The Schoolma'am</emph> yearbooks. Two unannotated 1915 yearbooks were removed from the
        collection and discarded. The box labels indicate that the yearbooks were owned by or
        intended for Cleveland Sadler, nephew to Elizabeth and Annie Cleveland. One box read,
        "Cleveland Sadler," and the second box, "This book I saved for Cleveland Sadler, unless he
        has one. I think Elizabeth might like it now, in the home."</p>

      <p>Two copies of the 1915 <emph render="italic">Schoolma'am</emph> yearbook were removed from
        this collection and discarded due lack of internal annotations and due to duplication
        elsewhere in Special Collections. The boxes in which the yearbooks were housed indicated
        that they belonged to or were intended to be given to Cleveland Sadler. The boxes were
        discarded. Photocopies of labels affixed to the boxes are retained.</p>
