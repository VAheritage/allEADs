         <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
         <p>Virginia Elizabeth Tisdale (Fenlon) was born in Chase City, Virginia (Mecklenburg
            County) on September 19, 1908 to George and Eliza Tisdale. She graduated from the
            professional courses at the State Teachers College in Harrisonburg, Virginia in 1927.
            While attending HSTC Mrs. Fenlon was the Society Editor for <emph render="italic">The
               Breeze</emph>; secretary of the Lanier Literary Society; Chairman of the Program
            Committee for the Lanier Literary Society; a member of the Cotillion Club, Choral Club,
            Athletic Association and the Y.W.C.A. Her inscription in the 1927 <emph render="italic"
               >School Ma'am</emph> reads: "A lovely being, scarcely formed or moulded, A rose with
            all its sweetest leaves yet folded." Pasted into her scrapbook is a printed quote which
            reads: "Virginia Tisdale's motto: Never let your studies interfere with your education."
            Upon graduating in 1927 Mrs. Fenlon accepted an elementary teaching position in
            Fredericksburg, Virginia. She married John Llewellyn Fenlon on March 24, 1937. Their
            daughter Jane, was born on July 8, 1940, in Richmond, Virginia. During World War II, the
            family was stationed in Corpus Christi, Texas. Shortly thereafter, they returned to
            Virginia, first to Richmond, then settling again in Fredericksburg by 1947, where Mrs.
            Fenlon then taught until retiring in 1968. She passed away on May 29, 1972. In 1994,
            Jane Fenlon Rowe established the Fenlon Memorial Scholarship in honor of her mother,
            Virginia Tisdale Fenlon, and Ada Virginia Pollock Fenlon, her stepmother. The
            scholarship is for students studying Early Childhood education.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Virginia Elizabeth Tisdale Fenlon Scrapbook, 1925-1930, consists of one scrapbook
            and one folder of photographs contained in one box. The folder contains photos of
            Virginia Tisdale Fenlon when she was a child, as well as while attending HSTC. The
            scrapbook is made out of a purple felt cover with orange lettering on the front. In
            script is written "Memories" and "STC" for State Teachers College. The contents
            of the scrapbook are mounted on black paper pages and consist of letters, telegrams,
            dance cards, May Day programs, the sophomore edition of <emph render="italic">The
               Breeze</emph> from May 28, 1927, place settings, invitations, a Cotillion Club
            banner, and a page covered in stamps from various letters Mrs. Fenlon received. Many of
            the pages include notes and captions written directly onto the pages. There are also a
            small number of black and white photographs and postcards. A large part of the scrapbook
            is reflective of her early years in Fredericksburg, Virginia as an elementary school
            teacher.</p>
