Her inscription in the 1927 <title render="italic">School Ma'am</title> reads: <title render="doublequote">A lovely being, scarcely formed or moulded, A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded.</title> Pasted into her scrapbook is a printed quote which reads: <title render="doublequote">Virginia Tisdale's motto: Never let your studies interfere with your education.</title> Upon graduating in 1927 Mrs. Fenlon accepted an Elementary teaching position in Fredericksburg, Virginia. She married John Llewellyn Fenlon on March 24, 1937. Their daughter Jane, was born on July 8, 1940, in Richmond, Virginia. During World War II, the family was stationed in Corpus Christi, Texas.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Virginia Elizabeth Tisdale Fenlon Collection, 1925-1930, consists of one scrapbook and one folder of photographs contained in one legal sized Hollinger box. The folder contains photos of Virginia Tisdale Fenlon when she was a child, as well as while attending HSTC. The scrapbook is made out of a purple felt cover with orange lettering on the front. In script is written <title render="doublequote">Memories</title> and <title render="doublequote">HTC</title> for Harrisonburg Teachers College. The contents of the scrapbook are mounted on black paper pages and consist of letters, telegrams, dance cards, May Day programs, the sophomore edition of <title render="italic">the Breeze</title> from May 28, 1927, place settings, invitations, a Cotillion Club banner, and a page covered in stamps from various letters Mrs. Fenlon received. Many of the pages include notes and captions written directly onto the pages. There are also a small number of black and white photographs and postcards. A large part of the scrapbook is reflective of her early years in Fredericksburg, Virginia as an elementary school teacher.
