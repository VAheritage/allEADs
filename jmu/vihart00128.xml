        <p>This collection came from the estate sale of James and Frances (Dellinger) Sheetz
					and subsequent re-sale on Ebay. In September of 2010 the Carrier Library
					purchased the collection for the James Madison University Special
					Collections.</p>

        <head>Processing Information</head>
        <p>The collection originally included a leather photo album that measured 8" by
					10.25" and was 1.5" thick and was embossed with flowers and a spade. Photographs
					were separated from the original album due to preservation issues. Each
					photograph or any other materials that were contained inside the album have been
					accounted for and are included within the collection.</p>

      <head>Biographical Information </head>
      <p>James Samuel Sheetz of Edinburg, Virginia, was born on 6 April 1917. He graduated
				from Edinburg High School in 1937 and married Francis Dellinger, also of Edinburg
				(date unknown). James passed away on 22 May 1994.</p>
      <p>Frances Dellinger Sheetz was born on 23 May 1918 in Edinburg, Virginia, to Lula and
				John Dellinger. Frances graduated from Edinburg High School in 1937 and married
				James S. Sheetz of Edinburg. She was an active member of her community and church,
				first at St. Paul's United Church of Christ of Edinburg until its dissolution, and
				then to St. Johns United Church of Christ in Hamburg. She was also a participant of
				the Edinburg Fire Company Ladies Auxiliary, the Shenandoah County Memorial Hospital
				Auxiliary, the Homemakers Department of the Shenandoah County Fair Association, the
				Edinburg Heritage Foundation, and the Family and Community Education Club. Frances
				passed away on Thursday, 16 April 2009, at the age of 90. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>The Sheetz-Dellinger Collection, 1870s-1950s, consists of .63 linear feet of
				material. The bulk of the material was created between the 1880s and 1930s.
				Originally purchased from the Sheetz estate sale in 2009, the collection consists of
				two series: Photographs and Ephemera.</p>
      <p>Series I, Photographs, contains eleven folders of portraits and other photographic
				images of various men, women, and children; presumably friends and family members of
				the Sheetz and Dellinger families. All of the photos are sepia or black and white,
				and most are accompanied by a matte frame which sometimes gives the photographer's
				name and is decoratively embellished. All of the images are arranged by subject
				matter, beginning with large groups, couples, families, women, men, children, and
				finally houses, landscapes, and miscellaneous photos. A large portion of the
				photographs are professionally done, and as a whole Series I offers a glimpse into
				the popular fashions of men, women, and children in the late nineteenth and early
				twentieth centuries.</p>
      <p>Series II, Ephemera, is composed of three folders that include school materials such
				as report cards, diplomas, a book of graduation name cards, and various ceremony and
				theatrical programs. The last of the three folders is titled "Miscellaneous" and
				consists of memorial cards, election reminder and birthday cards, a newspaper
				clipping, a Lententide folio from Emanuel Lutheran Church, a theatrical play
				booklet, and a used envelope. The memorial cards may prove useful when researching
				death and memorial rituals of Victorian culture in the late nineteenth century.</p>
