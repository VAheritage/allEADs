<head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
<p>Dorothy Noble Smith was a native of New Jersey and had a distinguished career in banking in New York City before she retired to Luray, VA.  She wrote for the <title render="italic">Page News and Courier</title> for more than 20 years and became well known in Page County.  Fascinated by a way of life that ended with the creation of Shenandoah National Park, she conducted interviews to document, as she says in the Preface to <title render="italic">Recollections</title>,  "a life beset with difficulties and troubles, but also resplendent with joys."

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Most of these oral histories were conducted by author Dorothy Noble Smith in the 1970s and early 1980s in preparation for her book, <title render="italic">Recollections:  the People of the Blue Ridge Remember</title> (Verona, VA:  McClure, 1983).  Other interviews were conducted by unknown interviewers.  The people interviewed resided in what is now Shenandoah National Park and were moved out after the park was dedicated in1934.  The interviews contain details of many different aspects of traditional mountain life.  Each interview may include photographs, a Mountain History Questionnaire (used by Ms. Smith for her research), reel to reel tapes, cassettes, computer disks, and transcripts, but not every file has every item.
