      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>Charles Triplett O'Ferrall (October 21, 1840-September 22, 1905) was born in Frederick County, Virginia, and spent much of his youth residing in Morgan County, Virginia (now West Virginia). After his father's death when O'Ferrall was fifteen, he took over his father's position as clerk pro tempore of the circuit court in Morgan County. Two years later he was elected clerk of the county circuit court there, a position he held until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. O'Ferrall joined the 12th Virginia Cavalry (CSA), Winchester in 1861 as a private. By 1865, he was an acting colonel managing forces in the Shenandoah Valley and saw action at Second Manassas (1862) and Upperville (1863). He sustained eight injuries over the course of service. During his recuperation in Enterprise, Mississippi, he met Anna E. McLean, and they were married February 8, 1865.
</p>
      <p>After the war, O'Ferrall and his wife briefly ran an inn in Staunton, Virginia. In 1868, O'Ferrall entered Washington College (now Washington and Lee) under Robert E. Lee and graduated with a law degree in August 1869. After moving to Harrisonburg, O'Ferrall was elected as a Democrat to the House of Delegates for two terms, 1871-1873. In 1874, he became judge of the Rockingham County Circuit Court, a position he held until 1880. In 1882, he won the Rockingham County Congressional election, and served five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1893, Democratic Congressman O'Ferrall was elected Governor. He ran on a bimetallic currency ticket, one which would later ruin his political career. His first two years in office were notable for his liberal stance against lynching and his favorable economic policies. O'Ferrall's downfall came, however, in 1896, when he refused to endorse the free silver platform of fellow Democrat William Jennings Bryan. O'Ferrall retired to Chesterfield County after two more years in office, where he wrote his book <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://leo.jmu.edu/record=b1300285~S0"><title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Forty Years of Active Service</title></extref> in 1904. Charles O'Ferrall died a year later in Richmond.

</head>
      <p>The Charles Triplett O'Ferrall Collection, 1870-1893, consists of 273 items in one 1/2 Hollinger box (0.209 linear feet) and one item in one flat box, and is arranged in three series: correspondence (1870-1893, n.d.), legal and financial (1873-1877, n.d.), and other (1874-1879, n.d.). The items therein cover O'Ferrall's post-war life and career until the decade leading up to his death.
