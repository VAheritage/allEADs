      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Charles Triplett O'Ferrall (October 21, 1840-September 22, 1905) was born in Frederick
        County, Virginia, and spent much of his youth residing in Morgan County, Virginia (now West
        Virginia). After his father's death when O'Ferrall was fifteen, he took over his father's
        position as clerk pro tempore of the circuit court in Morgan County. Two years later he was
        elected clerk of the county circuit court there, a position he held until the outbreak of
        the Civil War in 1861. O'Ferrall joined the 12th Virginia Cavalry (CSA), Winchester in 1861
        as a private. By 1865, he was an acting colonel managing forces in the Shenandoah Valley and
        saw action at Second Manassas (1862) and Upperville (1863). He sustained eight injuries over
        the course of service. During his recuperation in Enterprise, Mississippi, he met Anna E.
        McLean, and they were married February 8, 1865. </p>
      <p> After the war, O'Ferrall and his wife briefly ran an inn in Staunton, Virginia. In 1868,
        O'Ferrall entered Washington College (now Washington and Lee) under Robert E. Lee and
        graduated with a law degree in August 1869. After moving to Harrisonburg, O'Ferrall was
        elected as a Democrat to the House of Delegates for two terms, 1871-1873. In 1874, he became
        judge of the Rockingham County Circuit Court, a position he held until 1880. In 1882, he won
        the Rockingham County Congressional election, and served five terms in the U.S. House of
        Representatives. In 1893, Democratic Congressman O'Ferrall was elected Governor. He ran on a
        bimetallic currency ticket, one which would later ruin his political career. His first two
        years in office were notable for his liberal stance against lynching and his favorable
        economic policies. O'Ferrall's downfall came, however, in 1896, when he refused to endorse
        the free silver platform of fellow Democrat William Jennings Bryan. O'Ferrall retired to
        Chesterfield County after two more years in office, where he wrote his book <extref

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Charles Triplett O'Ferrall Papers, 1870-1893, consist of 273 items in one 1/2 Hollinger
        box (0.209 linear feet) and one item in one flat box, and is arranged in three series:
        correspondence (1870-1893), legal and financial (1873-1877), and other (1874-1879). The
        items therein cover O'Ferrall's post-war life and career until the decade leading up to his
        death. </p>
      <p>Correspondence, 1870-1893,includes letters and postcards to and from O'Ferrall related to
        his business matters and personal affairs. Many letters express sympathy for his wife's
        death in 1879. Also present is correspondence relating to the State Conservative Executive
        Committee, a group that supported O'Ferrall's bid for the House of Delegates and a group
        from which O'Ferrall elicited support in his gubernatorial campaign. Other items of note
        include letters from E. I. Armstrong, J. W. Bassore, Benjamin Milnes, Mrs. Charles
        O'Ferrall, Secretary of the Commonwealth James McDonald, Gilmore and Company with an
        enclosed advertisement and from Charles O'Ferrall to Fred W. M. Holliday.</p>
      <p>Legal and Financial, 1873-1877, includes legal documents related to O'Ferrall's various
        positions in law and government. Some items of note include bankruptcy notices, deeds, and
        the undated will of Mary Parrot.</p>
      <p>Other, 1874-1879, includes miscellaneous documents, newspaper clippings and an oversized
        broadside. Items of note include the report card of O'Ferrall's son Charles, an announcement
        about Dr. Moffett, a July 4, 1877 article from the <emph render="italic">Staunton
          Spectator</emph> entitled "The Public Debt-General Mahone's Views" and also one from a
        Washington D.C. paper discussing the Democratic policy in Virginia with "An Early
        Convention, Payne and Lee, and an Aggressive Fight." Other documents include "Mr.
        Alexander's reply to the last card of Col. Chas. T. O'Ferrall", 15 June, 1893 (original
        encapsulated, with xeroxed copy), "Remarks of Hon. Chas. T. O'Ferrall of Virginia on the
        life and character of Hon. William Henry Fitzhugh Lee, delivered in the House of
        Representatives," 6 February 1892, Washington, and an "Address to the Democrats of Virginia:
        The Record of Hon. Charles T. O'Ferrall, and his claims upon the Democratic Gubernatorial
        Nomination."</p>
