      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Hugh Starke Morrison was born February 4, 1840 in Orange, Virginia to William Dabney and
        Elizabeth Morrison (née Clinedinst). He married Susan Ann Elick in 1866 and had two children
        (Hugh Jr., b.1871 and Anna, b. 1875). Hugh Starke opened a photography studio on
        Harrisonburg’s Court Square in 1859. His son, Hugh Morrison Jr., became a traveling
        photographer in Shenandoah County, Virginia and went on to have his own successful
        photography studio in Woodstock. Hugh Starke operated his photography studio into the
        twentieth century. He passed away on March 11, 1925 in Harrisonburg, Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Hugh Starke Morrison Account Book, 1871-1876, consists of one ledger that documents the
        business transactions and expenses of Hugh Starke Morrison’s photography studio in
        Harrisonburg, Virginia. The account book is marked on the front inside page with “Hugh
        Morrison” and “March 11th 1871.” Approximately half of the 285-page account book records
        patrons’ names, location, services rendered, and their respective cost. Hugh Starke served
        customers from the greater Harrisonburg, Rockingham County, and Shenandoah County area
        including the towns of Lacey Spring, Cross Keys, Ottobine, Dayton, and New Market. The
        remaining pages record expenses. Part of the expenses listed relate to the photography
        studio and are designated as “gallery expenses.” These include frames, glass, and freight.
        Hugh Starke also kept monthly accounts for his personal expenses which included foodstuffs,
        clothing (“shoes for Susan $1.50”), and medicine. </p>
      <p>Of particular interest is a draft letter to Charles G. Allen dated April 30, 1872 (page
        275-276). In it, Hugh Starke writes:</p>

      <p><emph render="italic">I have been wide awake and duly sober and in the active pursuit of my
          Photographic occupation, enjoying the generous and remunerating patronage of the citizens
          of all ages sexes creeds and colors of the little Burg &amp; vicinity. I have been married
          since 66 and am proud of a hiarty [sic] little male heir who I hope will soon be able to
          assist me in making impressions of our good Patrons.</emph></p>

      <p>As fate would have it, Hugh Starke’s son, Hugh Morrison Jr., went on to have a prolific
        photography career of his own in Shenandoah County. Not related to Hugh Starke’s photography
        business are two drafts (page 280 and 283) of a February 12, 1872 letter that he wrote to
        The New York Times commenting on the growth of the Republican Party in Rockingham
        County.</p>
