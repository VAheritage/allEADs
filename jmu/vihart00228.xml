      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Given that the creator of the Copp's Schoolhouse Notebook and Ledger is unknown, the
        following biographical/historical note is written in general terms.</p>
      <p>Copp's Schoolhouse, originally located east of Route 11 on Route 600 in Maurertown,
        Virginia, was one of the oldest schools in Shenandoah County. The land for the school site
        was provided by Nicholas Doll ca. 1807 and was originally known as Doll School. The school
        functioned as a church and a school and also hosted other gatherings. At least for three
        dates in February 1867, Copp's Schoolhouse hosted the weekly meeting of the Johnsonian
        Lyceum, an organization comprised of local men who would pose and discuss esoteric topics.
        Copp's Schoolhouse eventually closed as the school age population shifted and other
        neighboring schools were built. The schoolhouse was razed ca. 1877 to erect the Valley Pike
        Church of the Brethren.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Copp's Schoolhouse Notebook and Ledger, 1867-1908, is comprised of one bound volume of
        notes on Dr. Benjamin Mosby Smith's lectures; the constitution, by-laws, and meeting minutes
        of the Johnsonian Lyceum (meetings were held at Copp's Schoolhouse in Maurertown, Virginia
        which was located in the Johnson Magisterial District); and unrelated personal property
        lists of Shenandoah County residents.</p>
      <p>The notebook begins with 12 pages of undated notes in an unknown hand titled
        "Interpretation of Dr. B. M. Smith's Lectures." Dr. Benjamin Mosby Smith (1811-1893) was a
        native Virginian and attended Hampden-Sydney College in Hampden Sydney, Virginia and Union
        Seminary in Richmond, Virginia. In 1854, he was elected chair of Oriental Literature at
        Union Seminary. The topics discussed in the notes include design of ministry, bible
        criticism, integrity of the Hebrew text, and Hebrew manuscripts.</p>
      <p>The following four pages include the constitution and by-laws of the Johnsonian Lyceum
        which met, at least for three meetings in February 1867, at Copp's Schoolhouse in
        Maurertown, Virginia. The lyceum's prime directive was the "cultivation of the mind and the
        improvement of its members in the art of [practical] speaking by the discussion of questions
        of practical importance." Also included is a list of members totaling 18 people. Members
        include N. Milton Rhodes (who is identified later in the notebook as the lyceum's
        president), Andrew M. Wright, Joseph B. McInturf, Joseph Doll, Silas Crabill, David Saum,
        and James Rosenberger. Three pages of meeting minute notes of the Johnsonian Lyceum follow.
        The general agenda for the meetings was to take roll, pose questions for future discussion,
        and discuss and vote on a question posed at a prior meeting. Questions proposed for
        discussion included "Does virtue always ensure happiness?," "Is the hope of reward a greater
        incentive to action than the fear of punishment?," Which deserves greater praise: Columbus
        for discovering or Washington for defending America?," and "Is the mind of woman inferior to
        that of man?" The latter question was debated at the February 20, 1867 meeting and, after
        some discussion, the lyceum voted in the negative.</p>
      <p>Thirty-two pages of additional lecture notes follow the Johnsonian Lyceum's meeting
        minutes. Topics are similar to the earlier lecture notes and include mentions of Jewish
        manuscripts, papyrus, and early inks.</p>
      <p>The notebook then transitions into an account book and includes eight pages of account
        information between Cline, Seiberling &amp; Co. and N. Milton Rhodes. According to the
        accounts, dated 1872-1875, Rhodes was primarily purchasing farm implements and paying for
        miscellaneous repairs.</p>
      <p>The remainder of the ledger dates from 1882 to 1908 and is comprised of inventories of
        personal property appraised and sold, and other miscellaneous financial statements.
        Individuals whose estates are sold off include John Fetzer, Isaac Wisman, William P. Stultz,
        and George M. Conner. Purchasers names are also listed; all are likely Shenandoah County
        residents.</p>
      <p>Various handwritings are present throughout the notebook and ledger. The creator(s) is
        unknown, though it is likely that N. Milton Rhodes was responsible for some of the
        notebook's content.</p>
