         <p>The origins of the 
         <title render="italic">Chesapeake Western (CW)
         Railway</title> date back at least to 1871, when the 
         <title render="italic">Washington, Cincinnati and St. Louis
         Railroad</title> was chartered in Virginia as a narrow-gauge
         railroad to run from Washington, D.C., through Elkton,
         Harrisonburg, and Bridgewater, VA, to Cincinnati, OH.
         Virginians bought stock in the corporation, including many
         people in Rockingham County; rights of way were purchased and
         railbed grading began. But like many similar ventures of the
         time, the goals of the company never bore fruit and work
         halted in 1874. 
         <lb />
         <lb />In 1892, a group of promoters including Jedediah
         Hotchkiss incorporated to build a railway to carry coal from
         West Virginia mines to Gloucester Point, Va. Initially called
         the 
         <title render="italic">Chesapeake, Shendun, and Western
         Railroad</title>, the name was quickly changed to 
         <title render="italic">Chesapeake &amp; Western
         Railroad</title>. Using parts of the old 
         <title render="italic">WC &amp; StL</title> right of way, and
         with $150,000 from the city of Harrisonburg to insure that the
         railroad would pass through it, a 26 mile single-track,
         standard- gauge line was completed from Elkton to Bridgewater
         and began operating on March 23, 1896. 
         <lb />
         <lb />In the next few years, substantial 
         <title render="italic">C &amp; W</title> stock was purchased by
         New York investor Thomas Stokes, who hoped to develop the coal
         mines in western Rockingham County but became mired in
         financial difficulties. His brother, W.E.D. Stokes, purchased
         control of the 
         <title render="italic">C &amp; W</title> and also organized a
         new railroad, the 
         <title render="italic">Tidewater and West Virginia</title>, in
         1900. This changed its name in 1901 to the 
         <title render="italic">Chesapeake Western Railway</title>,
         leased the 
         <title render="italic">C &amp; W</title> line for 99 years, and
         in 1902 completed 13 miles of rail from Bridgewater to the new
         town of Stokesville in North River Gap. Trains carried
         passengers as well as freight between Elkton and Stokesville.
         Plans were drawn up to continue the line into West Virginia,
         but were not implemented. For just over a decade, Stokesville
         boomed as timber, tanbark, and to a much more limited extent,
         coal, in the area were exploited. 
         <lb />
         <lb />Stokes operated the 
         <title render="italic">CW</title>, with offices in
         Harrisonburg, until his death in 1926; his estate operated it
         until 1938. In 1928 the line from Mt. Solon to North River Gap
         was abandoned for financial reasons; in 1933, the nine miles
         from Bridgewater to Mt. Solon were also dropped. When the
         Stokes heirs put the 
         <title render="italic">CW</title> up for sale in 1938, Don W.
         Thomas, a former 
         <title render="italic">Norfolk and Western
         Railroad</title> employee who had been the general manager of
         the 
         <title render="italic">CW</title> since 1926, fought a bid from
         Japanese scrap metal buyers and bought the line. 
         <lb />
         <lb />In 1943, Thomas also bought the 
         <title render="italic">Baltimore and Ohio's Valley Road of
         Virginia</title> line, which ran between Harrisonburg and
         Lexington. The line south of Staunton was taken up and sold
         for scrap, but the road between Harrisonburg and Staunton was
         improved and became an important link in the 
         <title render="italic">CW</title> system, because there was a
         connection with the 
         <title render="italic">Chesapeake &amp; Ohio
         Railroad</title> at Staunton. The 
         <title render="italic">CW</title> was linked with the 
         <title render="italic">Norfolk &amp; Western</title> at Elkton.
         <lb />
         <lb />In 1954, the 
         <title render="italic">Norfolk &amp; Western
         Railroad</title> purchased the 
         <title render="italic">CW</title>, but the name was retained
         and it was operated as a separate corporation. By about 1980,
         however, little or no rolling stock carried the 
         <title render="italic">CW</title> logo any longer. 
         <title render="italic">Norfolk &amp; Western</title> and the 
         <title render="italic">Southern Railway Company</title> merged
         as 
         <title render="italic">Norfolk Southern Corporation</title> on
         June 1, 1982. A five-alarm fire burned the 
         <title render="italic">CW</title> office located at Chesapeake
         Drive in Harrisonburg on July 28, 1982, and company offices
         and operations were eventually absorbed by 
         <title render="italic">NS</title>. Five miles of track east of
         Bridgewater were removed in 1988. The 
         <title render="italic">CW</title> under the control of 
         <title render="italic">NS</title> serves as the Harrisonburg
         area's poultry feed supplier, passing through the campus of
         James Madison University several times daily.</p>
