               building on Chesapeake Drive in Harrisonburg, Virginia which suffered a five-alarm

               Following their initial cleaning and inventory by students in History and
               Anthropology, the materials were transferred to Carrier Library in February 1998.</p>

         <head>Administrative History</head>
         <p>The origins of the Chesapeake Western Railway Company date back at least to 1871, when
            the Washington, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Railroad was chartered in Virginia as a
            narrow-gauge railroad to run from Washington, D.C., through Elkton, Harrisonburg, and
            Bridgewater, Virginia to Cincinnati, Ohio. Virginians bought stock in the coporation,
            including many people in Rockingham County; rights of way were purchased and railbed
            grading began. Like similar ventures of the time, the goals of the company never bore
            fruit, and work halted in 1874.</p>
         <p>In 1892, a group of promoters including Jedediah Hotchkiss incorporated to build a
            railway to carry coal from West Virginia mines to Gloucester Point, Virginia. Initially
            called the Chesapeake, Shendun, and Western Railroad, the name was quickly changed to
            Chesapeake &amp; Western Railroad. Using part of the old WC&amp;StL right-of-way, and
            with $150,000 from the city of Harrisonburg to ensure that the railroad would pass
            through it, a 26-mile single-track, standard-gauge line was completed from Elkton to
            Bridgewater and began operating on March 23, 1896. In the next few years, substantial
            C&amp;W stock was purchased by New York investor Thomas Stokes, who hoped to develop the
            coal mines in western Rockingham County but became mired in financial difficulties. His
            brother, W.E.D Stokes, purchased control of the C&amp;W and also organized a new
            railroad, the Tidewater and West Virginia, in 1900. The Tidewater changed its name in
            1901 to the Chesapeake Western Railway, leased the CW line for 99 years, and in 1902
            completed 13 miles of rail from Bridgewater to the new town of Stokesville in North
            River Gap. Trains carried passengers as well as freight between Elkton and Stokesville.
            Plans were drawn up to continue the line into West Virginia but were not
            implemented.</p>
         <p>For just over a decade, Stokesville boomed as timber, tanbark, and to a much more
            limited extent, coal, in the area were exploited. Stokes operated the CW with offices in
            Harrisonburg until his death in 1926. His estate continued to operate the railway until
            1938. In 1928, thi line from Mount Solon to North River Gap was abandoned for financial
            reasons. In 1933, the nine miles from Bridgewater to Mount Solon were also dropped. When
            the Stokes' heirs put the CW up for sale in 1938, Don W. Thomas, a former Norfolk &amp;
            Western Railroad employee who had been the general manager of the CW since 1926, fought
            a bid from Japanese scrap metal buyers and bought the line. In 1943, Thomas also bought
            the Baltimore &amp; Ohio's Valley Road of Virginia line which rean between Harrisonburg
            and Lexington. The line south of Staunton was taken up and sold for scrap, but the road
            between Harrisonburg and Staunton was improved and became an important link in the CW
            system because of the connection with the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad at Staunton.
            The CW linked with the Norfolk &amp; Western at Elkton.</p>
         <p>In 1954, the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad purchased CW, but the name was retained and
            was oeprated as a separate corporation. By about 1980, however, little or no rolling
            stock carried the CW logo any longer. Norfolk &amp; Western and the Southern Railway
            Company merged as Norfolk Southern Corporation on June 1, 1982. Not long after that
            merger, a five-alarm fire burned the CW office located at Chesapeake Drive in
            Harrisonburg on July 28, 1982, and company offices and operations were eventually
            absorbed by the NS. Five miles of track east of Bridgewater were removed in 1988. The CW
            under the control of NS serves as the Harrisonburg area's poultry feed supplier passing
            through the campus of James Madison University daily.</p>

               <p>Series 2: Reports, 1953-1981, primarily is comprised of Dispatcher and Conductor
                  reports, with information about specific trains, routes, departure times,
                  distances and engine numbers. Dispatchers' Record of Movement of Trains,
                  1973-1979, and Time Return and Delay Reports, 1975-1981, list information such as:
                  engineers' names, train departure times, type of service, etc. Conductor Car
                  Records and tonnage Reports include engine number, weight of trains, cargo, as
                  well as identification of conductors and engineers on each train. Entries for
                  Shipping logs, 1970-1977; Traffic Analyses and other shipping records, 1973-1981,
                  are followed by Per Diem/Mileage and Transfer Books, 1953-1970, which appear to be
                  freight and transfer records written in abbreviated code and organized
                  alphabetically by company name.</p>

                  Documents and invoices for parts and repair, indemnity releases, etc., 1955-1976;
