      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>One interesting aspect of the voter registrar is that it is specifically designated for
        white men only. In Virginia, African-Americans gained the right to vote after the
        Confederate states were commanded by President Andrew Jackson to hold conventions to write
        new constitutions. The army's commanding general in Virginia ordered for African-Americans
        to be elected into the convention and given the right to vote. The Underwood Convention that
        was henceforth commenced granted the right to vote to African Americans. However, despite
        these improvements, Republican leaders in Congress ceased to protect the rights of freedmen,
        leading to escalations in violence and segregation in towards African-Americans. At the time
        this ledger was in use, segregation would still have been very prominent, exemplified by
        this stark example of a "white men" voter registrar.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Bridgewater Voter Roll, 1902-1948, consists of one ledger dating from May 1910 to
        October 1948, with some back entries undated and dated from 1902 and 1907. The headings for
        the roll include : date of registration; number; name; birthdate; age in years; occupation;
        residence; length of residence in state, county, and precinct; "is he exempt from payment of
        poll tax as a prerequisite to voting?"; if naturalized, date of papers and by what court
        issued; if transferred, when and to what precinct. The earliest registrants listen are S.C.
        Miller in 1902 and John A. Shickel in 1907. The earliest birth date listed is Rev. H.C.
        Early, who was born in 1855. Occupations are varied from students, farmers, laborers,
        furniture makers, and dealer to less predictable fields such as photographer, vet surgeon,
        dentist, and naval aviator. Most registrants are local, or were transferred from within the
        state and region. A few exceptions are teachers, F.D. Dove who emigrated from Amsterdam in
        1928, and teacher, J. Emmett Ikenberry from Amsterdam in 1931. Most entries are handwritten
        in blue or black ink. "Deceased" is at times indicated in red ink.</p>
