      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>The tradition of the blackface minstrelsy dates back to the early nineteenth century and
        continued into the mid-twentieth century in various types of mass media (theatre,
        television, and film). As the name suggests, blackface minstrel shows primarily featured
        white men who would apply black makeup and act as African Americans. Stereotypical
        mannerisms, gestures, and dialects were often employed.</p>
      <p>Dating to the mid-1910s, the Middlebrook School housed grades one through seven and high
        school, and served the Middlebrook community of Augusta County, Virginia. Several school
        consolidations took place over the next fifty years until the Middlebrook Grade School
        shuttered its doors in 1967.</p>
      <p>The photographer, Walter S. Daggy (1896-1988), was based out of Mt. Solon, Virginia. His
        primary occupation was farming, but he also worked as a photographer for area newspapers.
        Daggy married Minnie Props on January 18, 1918 and was a lifelong resident of Mt. Solon.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Middlebrook School Minstrel Show Photograph, 1954, depicts the cast, including students
        and presumably teachers and administrators, of a minstrel show at the Middlebrook School in
        Augusta County, Virginia. The 8 x 10 inch black-and-white photograph features twenty-six
        youth and adults standing on a stage in a posed group shot. All but three are in blackface.
        In stereotypical fashion, one performer is holding a watermelon and one is holding a
        chicken.</p>
      <p>The photographer's stamp is imprinted on the verso; it reads: "'Today's Photographic
        Pleasures Are Tomorrow's Valued Treasures' Walter S. Daggy Photo and Finishing Mt. Solon,
        VA."</p>
