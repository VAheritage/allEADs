      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>A native of Union, New Jersey, Michael Arnold Cappeto transferred to Madison College from
        New Hampshire's Franklin Pierce College in 1967. While at Madison, Cappeto was an active
        member of the student body, serving as feature editor of The Breeze, SGO president, and
        Sigma Phi Epsilon president. In 1970, he was recognized as Man of the Year, the male
        counterpart to Miss Madison. Cappeto graduated from Madison College in 1970 with a Bachelor
        of Arts degree and in 1971 with his Master of Science in Education degree. He earned his
        doctoral degree from Virginia Tech. Cappeto went on to have a successful career in higher
        education. Between 1992 and 2003, he served as vice president and dean of the College at
        Colgate University in Hamilton, New York. From 2005 and 2010, Cappeto served as vice
        president for assessment, research, and test development at CPS Placement. Additionally, he
        has held various faculty and administrative positions at Marymount Manhattan College, Harvey
        Mudd College, and Washington and Lee University.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Michael A. Cappeto Letters, 1967, 2011, are comprised of two documents – a request from
        Madison College to prospective student Michael Cappeto for an on-campus interview with
        William J. DeLong, Director of Admissions and Student Aid and Michael Cappeto's personal
        reflection on that interaction.</p>
      <p>In the letter to Michael Cappeto dated June 12, 1967, William J. DeLong, Director of
        Admissions and Student Aid requests that Cappeto come to campus for a personal interview
        sometime after June 19, 1967 before the Admissions Committee can take further action on his
        application. Cappeto describes his interactions with DeLong in a letter dated June 30, 2011
        to Steve Smith, Associate Vice President of Constituent Relations. Of his interview with
        DeLong, Cappeto, who was transferring from a self-described hippie college, recounted the
        director's words – Madison College "doesn't need anyone coming from the north to tell us how
        to run things in Virginia," particularly in reference to African Americans. Cappeto was
        active in student government at his former college, Franklin Pierce College, and his
        perception was that the administration assumed that as a student leader, he would attempt to
        impose his progressive ideals onto Madison College.</p>
