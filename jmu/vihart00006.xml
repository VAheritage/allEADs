         <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
         <p>Thomas H. Arthur joined the staff of James Madison University in 1973, teaching both theater and speech as part of the Department of Communication Arts. He was instrumental in making theater at JMU into a college department. After the Department of Theatre and Dance was formed in 1986 as part of the College of Arts and Letters, Arthur would serve as the department head from 1987-1989. As a professor, he arranged semester abroad trips to London to expose students to British culture as well as professional theater productions. He continued to teach and direct productions at JMU as part of the faculty until his retirement in 2007. </p>
         <p>Arthur was a personal friend of actor Melvyn Douglas and his family, and wrote his doctoral thesis about Douglas's involvement in politics. In 1971, Arthur also collaborated with Douglas, at Douglas' request, to write his autobiography, <emph render="italic">See You at the Movies: The Autobiography of Melvyn Douglas</emph>. </p>
         <p>Melvyn Douglas was born Melvyn Hesselberg, on April 5, 1901 in Macon, Georgia. He began his theatrical career in 1917, and adopted the name 'Douglas' some time prior to his movie debut. During his career he was a star of the screen, stage, and television. He was the first male actor to win a Tony Award, an Emmy Award, and an Oscar. In addition to acting, Douglas served in both world wars and was active in politics. In 1940 he became the first actor to serve as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. He married in 1931 and died in New York City on August 4, 1981. A portion of this collection includes letters and notes relating to Dr. Arthur's book, <emph render="italic">See You at the Movies: The Autobiography of Melvyn Douglas</emph> (Lanham, Md. University Press of America, 1986). </p>

               <p>Series 1: Theater Programs and Printed Materials, 1953-2018, is separated into two subseries: theater programs and printed materials related to many of the shows represented in the playbills. The theater programs document the many plays and musicals that Arthur attended, with the majority playing in London and on Broadway and spanning more than 60 years. Playbills of note include programs from award-winning shows such as Hamilton, Kiss of the Spider Woman, The Lion King, My Fair Lady, and Cats, programs from productions that feature actors including Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Catherine Tate, Judi Dench, Viola Davis, and Gary Oldman, and programs from many versions of classic Shakespeare plays, such as Twelfth Night and Hamlet. The theater print material subseries comprises other theater-related pamphlets and programs, most of which are either souvenir brochures or pamphlets that include calendars for a particular season.</p>

               <p>Series 2: Scholarship and Teaching, 1979-2014, is separated into two-subseries: materials relating to Arthur's research on Melvyn Douglas and material from semesters abroad in London and Italy. The former consists of correspondence, notes and manuscripts, theater programs, and photographs related to Arthur's research for his dissertation abd biography on Melvyn Douglas. Some items of interest include a letter sent February 10, 1972 from actor Robert Redford to Melvyn Douglas, Douglas' handwritten notes for Arthur's book, theater programs that detail Melvyn Douglas's early performances in various theaters throughout the Midwest, and photographs of Melvyn Douglas (or family members of Douglas) that Thomas H. Arthur used in his biography of Douglas. The semester abroad sub-series consists of materials from Arthur's study abroad class. Much of the sub-series comprises museum guides and hotel brochures. Some items of interest include photographs taken by a student while on the trip (with some correspondence written on the back dated 1984), a photograph of Thomas Arthur and three other guests at the Mansion House in London, and an itinerary with dinner programs for the students.</p>
