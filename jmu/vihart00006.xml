<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Thomas H. Arthur was hired as a professor in 1973 to develop the theater program at James Madison University.  Arthur was a personal friend of Melvyn Douglas and his family, and wrote his doctoral thesis about Douglas' involvement in politics. In 1971, Arthur also collaborated with Douglas, at Douglas' request, to write his autobiography, <title render="italic">See You at the Movies: The Autobiography of Melvyn Douglas</title>. Arthur retired from JMU in 2007.
</p>
<p>Melvyn Douglas was born Melvyn Hesselberg, on April 5, 1901 in Macon, Georgia. He began his theatrical career in 1917, and adopted the name 'Douglas' some time prior to his movie debut. During his career he was a star of the screen, stage, and television. He was the first male actor to win a Tony Award, an Emmy Award, and an Oscar. In addition to acting, Douglas served in both world wars and was active in politics. In 1940 he became the first actor to serve as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. He was married in 1931 and died in New York City on August 4, 1981. This collection consists primarily of letters and notes relating to Dr. Arthur's book, <title render="italic">See You at the Movies: The Autobiography of Melvyn Douglas</title> (Lanham, Md. University Press of America, 1986).</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Thomas H. Arthur Papers, 1921-1982 and undated, consists of one Hollinger box (.417 linear feet). The collection consists of four series: Correspondence, Notes and Manuscripts, Programs from Early Performances and Photographs.
</p>
<p><title render="bold">Correspondence, 1970-1982</title>, consists of three folders containing letters mainly from Thomas H. Arthur to Melvyn Douglas regarding his biography, Arthur's dissertation on Douglas' involvement in politics, and planned visits for Douglas at James Madison University and Indiana State University (where Arthur taught previous to coming to JMU). Of special interest is a letter sent February 10, 1972 from actor Robert Redford to Melvyn Douglas.
</p>
<p><title render="bold">Notes and Manuscripts, undated</title>, consists of four folders containing a copy of Douglas' outline on acting, Douglas' handwritten notes for Arthur's book, and Arthur's manuscripts, which have been split into two folders
</p>
<p><title render="bold">Programs from early performances, 1921-1925</title>, consists of six folders containing programs for productions from various theaters in the Midwest, including the Rialto Theatre, New Grand Theatre, Orpheum Theatre and Fisher's Majestic Theatre. Also included are copies of newspaper clippings detailing the activities of Playmongers, a theatrical troupe which included Douglas, and their activities at the Chicago Festival in 1921. Folder 8 is primarily copies of newspaper clippings, centered around Chicago and the Playmongers.  Folder 9 contain programs mainly from the Rialto Theatre.  Folders 10, 11, 12, and 13 contain programs mainly from the New Grand, Orpheum and Fisher's Majestic Theaters. Folders are arranged chronologically, when dates are known.
</p>
<p><title render="bold">Photographs, undated</title>, consists of three folders containing photographs of Melvyn Douglas (or family members of Douglas) that Thomas H. Arthur used in his biography of Arthur. Photographs are mostly undated but are arranged in a semi-chronological order. The photographs are reprints and some predate 1921 including a Civil War era photograph, presumably of a family member of Melvyn Douglas.
