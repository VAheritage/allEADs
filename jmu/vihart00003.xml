        Virginia. Born in 1771 near Bremen, Germany, he came to the United States in 1797, and
        became the leading minister of the German Reformed Church in Virginia. In addition to his

        in 1818 by Laurenz Bartman, in Rockingham County, VA, he also translated excerpts from
        Thomas Jefferson on slavery, and was influential in the Rockingham County pauper school
        system, the forerunner of today's public school system in that county. </p>
      <p>Braun was married to Elizabeth Falls, and the couple raised eight children, three sons and
        five daughters, in the small parsonage near Bridgewater, Virginia. Braun passed away on

      <p>The Brown Family Papers, 1872-1919, consist of three folders containing 32 items,
        pertaining to the Brown Family of the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia. Comprised mainly of
        correspondence, the collection is arranged in three series: Correspondence and Receipts,
        Typescript, and Non-Print Materials. </p>
      <p>Names figuring prominently in the Correspondence and Receipts series are, Mrs. E.A. Jordon,
        Mr. Keller, Jacob H. Wysient, Annie Sites (Mrs. William H.), Dr. C.A. Brown, and William R.
        Brown. Also contained in this series are receipts of purchases printed on letterheads from
        various Staunton, Va. businesses; notification of dues; an Elementary Professional
        certificate for Mary A. Brown; photocopies of obituaries for William Rice Brown, Mrs. Mattie
        Jordon Calhoun, and F.G. Keller; and postcards, one of which is a photograph of the
        storefront of J.W. Jacobs, est. 1850. </p>
      <p>The Typescript series contains a typed translated copy of Johannes Braun's <title
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote"
          xlink:href="">A Treatise Concerning Slavery and Property in Human Beings.</title> This
        copy was translated from the original German by Harriet Augusta Braun. Ms. Braun's original
        translation is included here as well as a photocopy. </p>
      <p>The Non-Print Materials series includes photographs and printing blocks. The photographs
        are portraits of Brown family members: Rev. John Braun, William R. Brown, Rosalie Sprinkle,
        and two portraits of women whose names could not be identified. The printing blocks are
        images of three plows, likely used for letterheads. </p>
