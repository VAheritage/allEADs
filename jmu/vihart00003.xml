<head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
<p>Johannes Braun (or John Brown) was a highly educated and dedicated clergymen in western Virginia. Born in 1771 near Bremen, Germany, he came to the United States in 1797, and became the leading minister of the German Reformed Church in Virginia. In addition to his <title render="doublequote">A Treatise concerning Slavery and Property in Human Being</title> published in 1818 by Laurenz Bartman, in Rockingham County, VA, he also translated excerpts from Thomas Jefferson on slavery, and was influential in the Rockingham County pauper school system, the forerunner of today's public school system in that county.
</p>
<p>Braun was married to Elizabeth Falls, and the couple raised eight children, three sons and five daughters, in the small parsonage near Bridgewater, Virginia. Braun passed away on January 26, 1850 and he was buried in the yard of Friedens Church.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Brown Family Collection, 1872-1919, consists of three folders containing 32 items, pertaining to the Brown Family of the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia. Comprised mainly of correspondence, the collection is arranged in three series: Correspondence and Receipts, Typescript, and Non-Print Materials.
</p>
<p>Names figuring prominently in the Correspondence and Receipts series are, Mrs. E.A. Jordon, Mr. Keller, Jacob H. Wysient, Annie Sites (Mrs. William H.), Dr. C.A. Brown, and William R. Brown. Also contained in this series are receipts of purchases printed on letterheads from various Staunton, Va. businesses; notification of dues; an Elementary Professional certificate for Mary A. Brown; photocopies of obituaries for William Rice Brown, Mrs. Mattie Jordon Calhoun, and F.G. Keller; and postcards, one of which is a photograph of the storefront of J.W. Jacobs, est. 1850. 
</p>
<p>The Typescript series contains a typed translated copy of Johannes Braun's <title render="doublequote">A Treatise Concerning Slavery and Property in Human Beings.</title> This copy was translated from the original German by Harriet Augusta Braun. Ms. Braun's original translation is included here as well as a photocopy. 
</p>
<p>The Non-Print Materials series includes photographs and printing blocks. The photographs are portraits of Brown family members: Rev. John Braun, William R. Brown, Rosalie Sprinkle, and two portraits of women whose names could not be identified. The printing blocks are images of three plows, likely used for letterheads.
