      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Audie Tilghman was born in 1909 in Lunenburg, Virginia to William and Eulee Tilghman, and
        lived most of her life in Norfolk, Virginia. She was an only child, graduated from Maury
        High School, and was a life-long member of Norfolk’s Epworth Methodist church. She attended
        the State Teachers College in Harrisonburg, Virginia from 1926-1927 as a first year student.
        Audie did not return to school after her first year as her family’s finances dwindled. She
        then returned to Norfolk and worked for a Sears Department Store and later as a dispatcher
        for a furniture moving company. While in Norfolk, she often played the piano at the Loew’s
        movie theatre in downtown and was involved in her church. She married Henry Ottoway Holcombe
        in 1948, and died in 2001 in Portsmouth, Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>Audie writes letters to her home in Norfolk about her adventures and days at State Teachers
        College in Harrisonburg, Virginia. The letters are from her first year in 1926-1927. She
        writes to her family, her mother, Eulee Scott Tilghman, her father, William Clarence
        Tilghman, and her grandmother, “Big Momma.” Some letters are addressed to all three family
        members, others to her mother and father, and some are addressed individually. She writes of
        her college life, her daily schedule, class schedule, reading and homework, grades, studying
        for exams, dorm life, friends, food in the dining hall, attending church, chapel and Sunday
        school, young men visiting campus, requesting items and money be sent from home, cost of
        school material, weather, trips, and sketches of her dorm, Wellington Hall, and of campus.
        Most letters are written by Audie, but there are some letters addressed to Audie from her
        mother, father, and friends. Some letters were enclosed in envelopes, other envelopes were
        empty. </p>
      <p>Also in this collection are items from Audie, including hand drawn and purchased cards
        addressed to her and her mother and father, a financial letter addressed to her father in
        1930 from The Mutual Building Association about late loan payments, a Warner’s Renowned
        Remedies Company booklet, 1926 Loew’s State Theatre in Norfolk Thirty-Fifth Anniversary
        Union Mission pamphlet, an undated newspaper clipping about Audie’s election as President of
        the Young Progressive Club of Epworth M.E. Church, a 1926 bill statement to The J.M.
        Gwaltney Co., Inc., a 1926 bill to Mr. W.C. Tilghman, and a 1926 Epworth Methodist Episcopal
        Church bulletin. Also in this collection are two State Teachers College items, including a
        1926-1927 student handbook and a State Teachers College pamphlet with images of campus,
        buildings, and Harrisonburg and general information about professional data, curricula,
        programs of health and physical education, and student activities. </p>
