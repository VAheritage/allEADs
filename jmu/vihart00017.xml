         <p>John J. Forrer became the first Maintenance Engineer for the Virginia Department of
            Highways in 1923. He was promoted to Assistant Chief Engineer in 1951 and retired from
            the department a year later. He later served as Executive Director for the Virginia
            Asphalt Association until he retired from active service in 1958. Forrer pioneered the
            use of bituminous materials for road construction and started the development of
            low-cost roads under the pay-as-you-go system in the early 1920s.</p>
         <p>John J. Forrer conducted experiments with various types of asphalts and asphalt road
            oils used in surface treating soil base roads". Though his work was largely
            unsuccessful, Forrer continued his work with asphalt suppliers to develop several types
            of liquid asphalt which were fast-setting for surface treatments. Forrer was elected to
            the Asphalt Institute’s Roll of Honor in 1968; this award is the highest level of
            recognition conferred by the Asphalt Institute." Those chosen to receive this award have
            contributed tremendously to the asphalt industry through either sustained technical
            achievement or through the substantial contribution of leadership." John J. Forrer
            passed away on October 16, 1973.</p>
