      <head>Bio/Historical Note</head>
      <p>Elliott Guthrie Fishburne (also known as "Fish" or "Ellie") was born September 3, 1842 in
        Waynesboro, Virginia to Daniel and Margaret L. Guthrie Fishburne. He was married to Ella
        Letitia Vanlear Fishburne and they had three children. During the American Civil War he
        fought for the Confederacy in Company E of the 1st Virginia Cavalry, which fought in the
        battle of Gettysburg on July 3, 1863. According to published biographical information on
        Fishburne, he served as 3rd Sergeant for his regiment. After the war, Fishburne opened his
        own general merchandise store, "Fishburne's Cheap Cash and Trade Store" in Millboro Springs,
        Virginia. Shortly thereafter, he moved the business to its established location on Main
        Street in downtown Waynesboro, where it operated primarily as a drugstore until it was
        demolished in 1979. Fishburne died in Waynesboro on February 25, 1906. James Abbott
        Fishburne (1856-1923), Fishburne's brother, founded the Fishburne Military School in
        Waynesboro in 1879.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection consists of two handwritten documents by E.G. Fishburne: one memoir and one
        letter. The letter, dated April 1, 1886, is six pages and addressed to "Maj. H.B.
        McClellan," a fellow Confederate veteran who served as officer and adjutant general for
        Company G, 3rd Virginia Cavalry. As requested, Fishburne relates his recollection of the
        regiment's experience during the battle of Gettysburg. In addition, he offers both praise
        and corrections for McClellan's "book." Fishburne writes, "You ask if I have discovered any
        mistakes? So I will name or one or two as corrections . . . I like your book very much –
        read it with much interest. Have sold 20 copies only – I suppose they have sold many more in
        Staunton." Although Fishburne does not give the book title, he is presumably referring to
        McClellan's <emph render="italic">The Life and Campaigns of Major-General J.E.B.
          Stuart</emph>, published in 1885.</p>
      <p>The undated memoir is two pages and contains the title "The 1st VA Cavalry at Gettysburg.
        July 3, 1863" written at the top of the document. Given the memoir's similarities to the
        letter in terms of stationary, penmanship, and condition, the memoir was likely written in
        the 1880s. As the title suggests, the document contains Fishburne's first-hand account of
        actions taken by Company E of the 1st Virginia Cavalry during the battle of Gettysburg on
        July 3, 1863. Highlights include:</p>
      <p>"Very soon we were countermarched to take up another position when, just about the time the
        regiment got straightened out, the enemy was reported as charging, and overpowering our
        sharpshooters."</p>
      <p>"Just at this very critical point, while the enemy were overriding our dismounted men, the
        1st VA having been countermarched, was standing in column of fours with its rear to the line
        of battle; the command was given us. By fours, right about wheel! Forward! Charge! and away
        we went!"</p>
      <p>"I rode with General [J. E. B] Stuart a short distance while falling back, and got several
        shots at the pursuing enemy on our right &amp; rear, but they were soon checked."</p>
