				<p>When the collection was received from the Harrisonburg-Rockingham Historical
					Society in 1991, the materials consisted of one box of folders, mostly labeled
					“Civil War,” with no apparent arrangement. After review, three collections were
					established from the materials: Sons of Confederate Veterans Collection,
					1896-1964, SC 3040; United Confederate Veterans Collection, 1893-1938, SC 3045;
					and Civil War Miscellaneous Collection, 1860-2005, SC 3050.</p>

			<head>Biographical Information </head>
			<p>Civil War records within the collection were issued by government entities, including
				the Department of the Interior and the Treasury Department, along with various war
				offices. Notable individuals with papers represented in this collection include
				local Shenandoah Valley historian John W. Wayland, 1872-1962, and Cassie Moncure
				Lyne, 1875-1955, a Civil War writer and poet from Virginia. </p>

			<head>Scope and Content </head>
			<p>The Civil War Miscellaneous Collection, 1860-2005 consists of one half Hollinger box;
				.209 linear feet of materials related to the Civil War. This is an assembled
				collection, and the order of materials has been imposed by the archivist from the
				original unordered arrangement. Civil War records included in the collection consist
				of muster rolls from the years 1862-1865, certificates of discharge and pension,
				lists of veterans, and lists of applicants and recipients of the Southern Cross of
				Honor from the years 1860-1926. Most of these records pertain to Confederate
				regiments and individuals from Rockingham and Shenandoah Counties, but there are
				also a few records related to regiments and soldiers within the Union Army. Other
				materials include personal letters from Civil War soldiers giving views of camp life
				and activities in and around Rockingham and Shenandoah Counties, writings by local
				historian John W. Wayland, twentieth century newspaper clippings relating to the
				Civil War, letters and poetry by Cassie Moncure Lyne, materials relating to
				Harrisonburg Civil War museums and monuments, and late nineteenth and twentieth
				century bulletins and pamphlets about the Civil War. Please note that not all dates
				are inclusive. </p>
