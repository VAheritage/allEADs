         <head>Bio/Historical Information</head>
         <p>Tresa Florence "Tish" Quarles, a native of Buchanan, Virginia, matriculated at Madison College in 1953. During her time as a student, Quarles was active in student organizations, extracurricular activities, and extramural sports. Specifically, Quarles was a member of Pi Kappa Sigma, Athletic Association, Cotillion Dance Club, Mercury Club, YWCA, and Field Hockey (Blue Ridge Hockey Tournament). She exhibited leadership as Dormitory President, Sportsleader, Recreation Leader, and Sophomore Class Sergeant-at-Arms. Quarles graduated in 1957 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Education. She went on to teach health and physical education at several Virginia high schools including Harrisonburg High School (HHS). Quarles taught at HHS from 1966 until her retirement in 1989. She is a member of the HHS Hall of Fame due to her outstanding contributions as a coach of numerous girls sports.</p>
         <p>After Quarles retired from teaching and coaching, she entered Eastern Mennonite Seminary in Harrisonburg and went on to serve as a pastor at Linville United Church of Christ and St. Stephen's United Church of Christ in Harrisonburg.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Tresa F. Quarles Scrapbook, 1953-2007 (bulk 1953-1957), comprises captioned photographs, correspondence, and ephemera documenting Quarles' time as a student at Madison College and as an alumni. Also included are six typed reminiscences written by Quarles in which she recalls highlights from her time at Madison College. </p>
         <p>The scrapbook contains photographs of Quarles and her classmates on and around campus, pamphlets and programs related to university events,  photocopied newsclippings from <emph render="italic">The Breeze</emph>, Athletic Association Handbooks, felt patches, ribbons, and ephemera related to Quarles' participation in field hockey. Much of the contents in the scrapbook is captioned.</p>
         <p>Of particular interest is a letter dated December 6, 1955 addressed to Quarles from Catherine Howard, Secretary of the Student Government Association. Howard alerted Quarles that she was being placed on "plain campus" for participating in a panty raid. A student placed under plain campus regulations was required to "forfeit trips to Doc's, Dairy Rite, Kile's service station just off campus, and trips to town and out of town." Similarly, Quarles received one "call down" for making use of "1:00 permission without requesting a permission slip from Dean Wilkins."</p>
         <p>Quarles' reminiscences comprise humorous anecdotes in which she discusses professors John McElreath, Celeste Ulrich, Marjorie Tate, Raymond Cool, and Stephen Bosckey.</p>
