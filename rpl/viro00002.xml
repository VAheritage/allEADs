<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>When St. Andrew's Church was first established in 1882, its first pastor, Father Lynch, felt strongly that the church should invest in a school.  The first school building was opened in 1889 and was called the Hall or Little School. It was a two story framed structure on the south end of the church property.  Lay members served as educators at the first school, with boys being taught downstairs and the girl's classes upstairs.  In order to secure the longevity of the school and build an adequate facility, Lynch agreed to open an orphan asylum, a priority for the Richmond Diocese.  The orphanage was opened on the grounds. The Sisters who ran the Asylum also ran the school.  Beginning in 1893 under the leadership of Sister Mary Vincent Hardie, the orphanage and school opened and operated out of the first Saint Vincent's building.  The school and asylum operated as a single institution until 1931 when they were split.  The orphanage became Saint Vincent's and the school became known as St. Andrew's Catholic School.  The high school that was built in 1931 is still used as part of Roanoke Catholic, with additions to the school being built in the 1990's.  The school remains a leader in Catholic school education. It was listed among the top 50 Catholic schools in the United States in 2004.
