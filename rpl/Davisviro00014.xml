<head>Biographical Note </head>

<p>Ruth Elizabeth Davis was born on December 8, 1892 in Davis Fancy Groseclose, Virginia.  She was the youngest daughter of George W. and Ella Sprinkle Davis and a descendent of James Davis, the first permanent settler in the Smyth County, Virginia community known as Davis Fancy.  Ruth Davis was a graduate of the Jefferson Hospital School of Nursing and worked as a registered nurse in Jefferson Hospital and Roanoke Community Hospital until her retirement.  She died in Roanoke on August 27, 1978. </p>

<head>Scope and Content </head>

<p>This is a collection of materials related to Ruth Davis’ enrollment in the Jefferson Hospital School of Nursing from which she graduated in 1926.  The collection includes five folders that contain items such as newspaper articles about Jefferson Hospital and its founder, Dr. Hugh H. Trout, memorabilia about Florence Nightingale, nursing, and unidentified photographs.  The collection also contains Ruth Davis’ Nurses New Testament Bible and her Memory Book that holds many unidentified photographs, most likely of fellow nursing students, doctors, and other hospital staff.

Jefferson Hospital, formerly located on Franklin Road, was founded in 1907 by Dr. Hugh H. Trout, Sr., and served Roanoke for 50 years.  Originally organized as a proprietary organization, it became a charitable hospital in 1957.  A training school for nurses was opened in 1914.  660 nurses graduated from the Jefferson Hospital School of Nursing which eventually merged with the Lewis-Gale Hospital School of Nursing to form the School of Nursing of the CHRV (Community Hospital of Roanoke Valley) in 1965.  The hospital and school of nursing were closed for approximately a year during World War I when Dr. Trout went to France to direct an Army Mobile Operating Unit.  During this time, the nursing students were sent to Baltimore to continue their studies.  In 1967, Jefferson Hospital merged with Lewis-Gale Hospital to form the Community Hospital of Roanoke Valley.
