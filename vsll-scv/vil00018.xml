<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>In 1972, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation establishing general district and juvenile and domestic relations district courts.  Beginning July 1, 1973, every county and city was required to have one general district court and one juvenile and domestic relations district court, with one or more general district court judges and one or more juvenile and domestic relations district court judges. (Virginia Code 16.1-69.7) Town courts with general civil and criminal jurisdiction were abolished and their jurisdiction was conferred to the county district courts wherein the town was located. (Virginia Code 16.1-69.8)</p>
<p>The Committee on District Courts was created by act of Assembly in 1972 to assist the Chief Justice in the administrative supervision of Virginia's unified court system. Among the statutorily mandated responsibilities of the CDC are recommending new judgeships and certifying the need to fill district court vacancies, authorizing the number of clerks, magistrates and personnel in each district, establishing guidelines and policies for court system personnel and fixing salary classification schedules for district court personnel and magistrates. (Virginia Code 16.1-69.33)</p>
<p>Membership of the Committee includes the Chairmen of the Committees for Courts of Justice in the Senate and House of Delegates, two members of each of the Courts of Justice Committees appointed by the respective Chairmen, the Speaker of the House of Delegates, the Majority Leader of the Senate of Virginia, one circuit court judge, two general district court judges and two juvenile and domestic relations district court judges. These judicial members are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Chief Justice. (Virginia Code 16.1-69.33)</p>
