<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia was created by an act of the new General Assembly in 1779. Its jurisdiction was primarily appellate, and its members were elected by the legislature. The Constitution of 1971 changed the name of the court to its present title of Supreme Court of Virginia.
</p> 
<p>Any lawyer licensed to practice law in any court in Virginia was permitted to practice in any other court in Virginia, provided he take an oath of fidelity to the Commonwealth of Virginia and to honestly demean himself in the practice of the law, and to the best of his ability execute his office of attorney at law. This provision also applied to residents of any state adjoining Virginia or the District of Columbia. (Code of Virginia, Including Legislation to the Year 1860, Chapter CLXIV, 699).

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Thh List of Lawyers Practicing in the Court of Appeals, 1869-1978 is a register  of signatures of attorneys who took the oath required by law of licensed lawyers who practiced in the Supreme Court of Virginia from 1969 to 1978. Most entries include the date the year the oath was taken, and the residence of the lawyer (town, courthouse, county, or city). Beginning in 1907, each entry includes the date the attorney qualified.</p>
<p>Although it represents only those lawyers who appeared in the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, this register is one of the few records of licensed lawyers in Virginia from 1869 to 1896.</p>
<p> The first written bar exam was administered by the Court of Appeals in 1897, and the names of those who passed were published by Virginia Law Register (Lynchburg: J.P. Bell Company).  In 1910, the An act approved by the General Assembly March 14, 1910, established the Virginia Board of Bar Examiners and authorized it to license lawyers and determine the qualifications of applicants who wished to take the bar examination. The Board served under the auspices of the Supreme Court of Appeals.</p>
