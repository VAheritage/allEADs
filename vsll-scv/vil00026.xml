<head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
<p>The position of state law librarian is addressed in the Code of Virginia, section 42.1-60, originally enacted in 1902. The section enacted in 1902 provides for the "establishment of a State law library at Richmond, with branches thereof at Wytheville and Staunton, maintained as at present, which shall be managed by the supreme court of appeals. The said court shall appoint the librarian and other employees, to hold office during the pleasure of the court." Previously, the state law library in Richmond was managed by the general librarian of Virginia.  The branches in Staunton and Wytheville and were managed by the Supreme Court of Appeals clerks in those locations.</p>
<p>The first state law librarian was William W. Scott, who served from 1904 to 1929. (From 1894 to 1904, Scott was responsible for the state law library in Richmond as part of his duties as the general librarian of Virginia.) Scott was followed by Lloyd M. Richards, who held the position from 1929 to 1961; H. Elmer Kiser (1961-1966), Walter S. Griggs, Jr. (1966-1967), and Marjorie Kirtley (1967-1982).</p>
