      <p>The Court of Appeals of Virginia was established January 1, 1985. It provides appellate review of final decisions of the circuit courts in
domestic relations matters, appeals from decisions of an administrative agency, traffic infractions and
criminal cases, except where a sentence of death has been imposed. It also hears appeals of final decisions
of the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission. Except in those cases where the decision of
the Court of Appeals is final, any party aggrieved by a decision of the Court of Appeals may petition the Supreme Court for an appeal.
The Court of Appeals consists of eleven judges. The court sits in panels of at least three judges, and the membership of the panels is rotated. The court sits at such locations as the chief judge designates, so as to provide convenient access to the various geographic areas of the Commonwealth.</p>
      <p>James W. Benton, Jr. (b. 1944) was appointed to the Court of Appeals of Virginia in 1985 and retired in 2007. A native of Norfolk, Benton attended public schools there and participated in civil rights demonstrations while he was in high school. He earned an undergraduate degree from Temple University in Boston and a law degree from the University of Virginia.  He worked for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in Richmond and was a partner at the Richmond law firm of Hill, Tucker Marsh.</p>
      <p>Johanna L. Fitzpatrick (b. 1946) served on the Court of Appeals of Virginia from 1992 to 2006. A native of Birmingham, Alabama, she attended Tufts University in Boston and earned a law degree from Catholic University in Washington, D.C.  She began working for Fairfax Legal Aid Society in 1974.  In 1980, she was elected Juvenile and Domestic Relations judge in Fairfax County, making her the second woman elected judge in Virginia.  In 1982, Fitzpatrick was elected circuit court judge in Fairfax County.  
</p>
      <p>James W. Haley, Jr. (b. 1942) served on the Court of Appeals of Virginia from 2005 to 2012, when he took senior status. He was born in Washington, DC and reared in Arlington. Haley attended Washington and Lee University and the University of Virginia School of Law.  He was a law clerk for Chief Justice John W. Eggleston in 1967 and 1968, then worked as an assistant commonwealth's attorney in Arlington County. He practiced law in Fredericksburg County and was County Attorney in King George County. In 1985, he was elected general district judge in the 15 judicial circuit, and in 1989 circuit court judge in the same circuit. He was elected to the Court of Appeals in 2005.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court of Virginia Historical Commission was established in 2006 to preserve and promote the history of the court.  Oral history interviews of retired Supreme Court justices, Court of Appeals judges, other individuals associated with the court, and civil rights attorneys were begun in 2007.  The project is ongoing.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>In the interview of Judge James W. Benton, Jr., conducted March 12, 2009 (2 hours, 12 minutes; transcript available), Benton discusses growing up in the Huntersville neighborhood of Norfolk Va., attending segregated schools, participating in sit-in protests to desegregate public facilities, and being among the first African Americans to attend a formerly white high school in Norfolk.  He talks about attending Temple University in Philadelphia, graduate school in Northwestern University in Chicago, and law school at the University of Virginia in the late 1960s and the experience of being one of the first African Americans to attend the law school. He relates his experiences working as an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund at the Richmond law firm Hill, Tucker, Marsh in Richmond; his work on the Norfolk school desegregation court cases, and his work on business cases and housing discrimination cases in the 1970s and 1980s. Benton also talks about the circumstances leading to his appointment on the Court of Appeals of Virginia when it was established in 1985, the work of establishing the court, his approach to his role as a judge, his thoughts about writing dissenting opinions, and his views on constitutional rights and criminal cases.  
</p>
      <p>In the interview of Judge Johanna Levenson Fitzpatrick, conducted July 13, 2009 (2 hours; transcript available), Judge Fitzpatrick talks about her early life and growing up in Birmingham, Alabama, where her father owned a department store; her education at Tufts University in Boston and Catholic University Law School in Washington, D.C., working as a legal-aid lawyer and on revisions to the code on neglect and abuse of children; and her work as a juvenile and domestic relations judge and a circuit court judge in Fairfax County. She talks about breaking down gender barriers as a judge in Virginia, and her appointment to the Court of Appeals of Virginia in 1992; choosing and mentoring law clerks, the process of writing opinions, differences between working as a trial judge and an appellate judge, her decision to retire in 2006, and her subsequent career as a mediator.    
</p>
      <p>In the interview of Judge James W. Haley, Jr., conducted September 11, 2013 (1 hour, 45 minutes, 24 seconds; transcript available), Judge Haley talks about growing up in Arlington, Virginia, and the influence of his parents (his father was a lawyer and worked as a lobbyist for coal companies; his mother was an attorney for the Treasury Department before Haley was born) and teachers at St. Stephen's Episcopal School for Boys, Washington and Lee, and the University of Virginia. He reflects on the experience of clerking for Chief Justice Eggleston and working for Commonwealth's Attorney William Hassan and a county attorney in King George County, and his experiences in private practice and as a district, circuit, and appellate judge on the Court of Appeals.</p>
