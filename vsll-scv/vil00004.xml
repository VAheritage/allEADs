<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Thomas Turner Fauntleroy (1823-1906) was born in Winchester, Virginia, in 1823. He was a graduate of the University of Virginia Law school and practiced law in Winchester.  In 1882, Fauntleroy was one of five judges elected to the Supreme Court by the Readjuster majority in the legislature.  He was elected to a twelve-year term beginning in 1883 and retired when his term ended.</p>
<p>James B. Dorman was Clerk of the Supreme Court of Appeals in Staunton.  The Constitution of 1870 required that annual sessions of the Court be held away from Richmond in the localities of Wytheville, Staunton, and Winchester.</p>
<p>Holmes Conrad (1840-1915) was a leader in the Democratic party of Virginia and a charter member of the Virginia Bar Association, organized in 1890.</p>
<p>James A. Walker (1832-1901) was a lawyer in Pulaski, Virginia.   He was elected to Congress as a Democrat and later as a Republican. Walker was also a charter member of the Virginia Bar Association.</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The collection contains four personal letters written by Judge Thomas T. Fauntleroy, in Richmond and Wytheville, to James B. Dorman, in Staunton, between 1885 and 1890.    In one letter, Fauntleroy describes a meeting of lawyers in Virginia Beach in July 1888 to organize a state bar association.  At the meeting, Holmes Conrad, another lawyer from Winchester, criticized the Supreme Court of Appeals and proposed to publish the criticism as an opinion of the new state bar association.  According to Fauntleroy, General James Walker, a lawyer from Pulaski, came to the defense of the Court, and the proposal was withdrawn from consideration. In the other letters, Fauntleroy complains to his friend Dorman of perceived slights and laments the death, in 1890, of a friend and law school classmate, Judge McCue.</p>
