      <p>Mark Bernard "Bunny" Hardin, son of Lauriston Bonaparte
         Hardin and Anna M. H. Hooe, was born at Alexandria, Virginia
         on August 14, 1838. He entered the Virginia Military Institute
         on September 7, 1854 and graduated on July 4, 1858, standing
         first in his class. Following graduation he joined the faculty
         at VMI, teaching Chemistry and other subjects until the
         beginning of the Civil War.</p>
      <p>Hardin served with the 33rd and 9th Virginia Infantry
         Regiments and with the 18th Battalion Virginia Heavy
         Artillery. He was captured at Sayler's Creek on April 6, 1865
         and held at Old Capitol and Johnson's Island prisons. He was
         released on oath July 3 (some records say June 27) 1865.</p>
      <p>Following the war, Hardin established an analytical
         chemistry business in New York City, where he resided until
         July 1867. He accepted a position as Professor of Chemistry at
         his alma mater, VMI, in the summer of 1867, and remained at
         the Institute until September 1890. From September 1890 until
         1910 he taught at Clemson University.</p>
      <p>Hardin married Mary Massie Payne of Wareenton, Virginia, on
         August 4, 1869. The couple had 8 children (4 sons and 4
         daughters). He died at Clemson, South Carolina, on April 26,
         1916. He is buried at the Old Stone Church Cemetery,
         Clemson.</p>
