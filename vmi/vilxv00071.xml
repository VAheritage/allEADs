<p>Abram Franklin Kibler was born in Staunton, Virginia on July 10, 1891, the son of Green Markwood Kibler and Almira Erena Fishburn. He graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1912 and was commissioned
a 2nd Lieutenant in the United States Army in 1917. His military career spanned 35 years and he rose to the rank of Major General before his retirement in 1952. During World War II he was a senior member on the
staff of General Omar Bradley, serving as Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations, 12th Army Group, European Theater. In 1946 he was assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff as Deputy U. S. Army representative to the
United Nations staff committee, and in 1949 he was named Chief of the U. S. delegation to the Military Committee of the Five Powers (Brussels Pact). General Kibler died at Walter Reed Army Hospital on January 24,
