duty in March 1943. Moss started his 26 months of overseas duty in September, 1943, serving with the 15th Field Artillery Observation Battalion and attaining the rank of Sergeant. He participated in a number of
critical battles, including Anzio Beachhead, Mt. Camino, and Monte Cassino; his unit saw 554 days of continuous combat operations.
