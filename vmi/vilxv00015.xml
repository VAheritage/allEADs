         <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
         <p>Charles A. Derby, the son of Perry L. Derby and Martha
         [maiden name not known] was born in Dinwiddie County, Virginia
         on September 12, 1828. His early years were spent on his
         father's plantation and as a student at Winfield Academy in
         Dinwiddie County. He entered the Virginia Military Institute
         on August 8, 1845 and graduated on July 4, 1848, standing 5th
         in a class of 24.</p>
         <p>Following his graduation from VMI, Derby began a teaching
         career that continued through the late 1850's. His various
         positions included work as a private tutor for a family in
         Northumberland County, Virginia; head of the Fairfax
         (VA)Academy; head of an academy in Sumterville, Alabama;
         professor of mathematics at military schools in Kentucky and
         Georgia; and as principal of a private academy in Eutaw,
         Alabama.</p>
         <p>In 1856-1857 Derby began the study of theology and was
         ordained in the Episcopal ministry. He was named deacon at St.
         Stephens's Church in Eutaw, while also continuing his private
         school there. He subsequently gave up teaching as his primary
         interest and served at a church in Camden, Alabama, and then
         at St. Peter's Church, Lowndes County, Alabama.</p>
         <p>Derby married twice during the 1850's. His first wife,
         Clara J. Hunt of Marietta, Georgia, died within a year of her
         marriage. On December 28, 1859, he married Charlotte Basset of
         Cahaba, Alabama. The couple had two daughters, Martha (b.
         October 1860) and Harriet (b. April 1862 d. February
         1927).</p>
         <p>A year after the outbreak of the Civil War, Derby joined
         the Confederate Army. He was elected Lt. Colonel of the 44th
         Alabama Infantry Regiment on May 16, 1862 and entered service
         at Selma, AL circa June 5, 1862. He was killed in action at
         the Battle of Antietam (Maryland) on September 17, 1872. His
         body was not recovered.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The bulk of the collection consists of Derby family
         correspondence. Approximately twenty-eight letters were
         written by Charles Derby. The Charles Derby letters,
         1844-1862, cover the period from late boyhood up to his death
         in battle in 1862. Included are letters (1846-1847) written
         while he was a cadet at the Virginia Military Institute, as
         well as correspondence dating from his careers as teacher and
         Episcopal clergyman. Two items were written during his brief
         service in the Confederate Army.</p>
         <p>The papers also include fourteen letters written by other
         members of the Derby Family, primarily Mary Derby Stancell
         ("Mollie") and her husband, Samuel.</p>
         <p>Other items in the papers are clippings, wedding
         announcements, poetry, and other family miscellany.</p>

                     worst comes to the worst, I may break over the
                     prescribed limits at the risk of being deposed. I
