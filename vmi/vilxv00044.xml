      <p>William James Hubard, the son of William Hubard and Maria
         Mason Tabb, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on February
         8, 1845. He enrolled at the Virginia Military Institute in
         Lexington, Virginia in March 1862 and on May 15, 1864 took
         part in the Battle of New Market, Virginia. The following
         autumn he was commissioned a Lieutenant in the First
         Confederate Foreign Battalion, in which he served from
         November 1864 until he re-entered VMI on February 23,
         1865.</p>
      <p>After the Civil War Hubard taught school for several years
         and then worked as a civil engineer and in business until
         1896. He spent the rest of his life working for the Masonic
         Order, and was Grand Lecturer of the Grand Royal Arch Chapter
         of Masons of Virginia. He married Mary Booth Troutman of Long
         Branch, New Jersey and they had one son, Nathaniel Walter
         (also a VMI graduate). Hubard died at his home in Richmond,
         Virginia, on April 20, 1917 and is buried in Hollywood
         Cemetery, Richmond.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection consists of a one volume notebook compiled
         in 1862 by Virginia Military Institute Cadet William James
         Hubard. The bulk of the volume contains poetry and mementos;
         there are also two diary entries. The poetry includes 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Six Plebes</title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Old Gray Coat</title>by Sarah
         Henderson Smith, and several poems attributed to Cadets Edward
         A. Rhodes, John F. Hanna, and Benjamin F. Bishop. Subjects of
         the verses are VMI life and regulations, including many
         references to faculty members (Francis H. Smith, Raleigh
         Colston, John T. L. Preston, William Gilham, Thomas H.
         Williamson, and Thomas J. (Stonewall) Jackson.</p>
      <p>Mementos consist of autographs and dried pressed leaves
         presented to Hubard by young ladies. One sprig of cedar is
         labelled as being from Stonewall Jackson's coffin.</p>
      <p>The notebook also contains two diary entries. The first,
         dated November 2, 1862, concerns the death of Cadet William
         Thomas Fleming, who died of typhoid fever. The second entry
         mentions Hubard's examinations on June 24, 1863.</p>
