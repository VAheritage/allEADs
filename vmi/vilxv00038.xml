      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Jennings Cropper Wise, lawyer and army officer, was born on
         September 10, 1881 in Richmond, Virginia. He graduated from
         the Phillip Exeter Academy (New Hampshire) in 1882 and from
         the Virginia Military Institute in 1902. He subsequently
         received a law degree from the University of Virginia.</p>
      <p>Wise spent the majority of his career in the practice of
         law, primarily in private practice. He was associated with the
         firms of Pollard , Wise and Chichester (Richmond, Virginia),
         and Munn, Anderson and Munn (Washington, DC). In addition, he
         taught at his alma mater, the Virginia Military Institute
         (1912-1915) and he served as a Lieutenant Colonel in the AEF
         during World War I.</p>
      <p>Following his retirement in 1954, he concentrated on
         researching and writing a book ultimately published under the
         title 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sunrise of the Virginia Military
         Institute as a School of Arms.</title>. He died in 1968.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Jennings C. Wise Papers consist primarily of incoming
         and outgoing correspondence from the period 1910-1960.
         Included are letters dating from his years as Professor and
         Commandant of Cadets at VMI, from his practice of law, and
         from his retirement period in which he devoted himself
         primarily to writing. Wise was passionately interested in the
         history and future development of VMI and much of the
         correspondence reflects his ongoing involvement with the
         school. He often held controversial views and frequently
         expressed his dismay at what he perceived to be a lessening of
         military discipline at VMI.</p>
      <p>Other items in the papers include memoranda, editorials and
         articles written by Wise, circulars, notebooks, printed
         material, and a photograph album (1913-1914) documenting the
         retirement of the VMI Cadet Battery and the 50th Anniversary
         of the Battle of New Market, Virginia.</p>
