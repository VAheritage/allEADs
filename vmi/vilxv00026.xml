         <p>James Jameson, from Culpeper County, Virginia, was born
         circa 1820 and graduated from the Virginia Military Institute
         in 1842. Prior to the Civil War he worked as a teacher, lawyer
         and farmer. He married Mary Mildred Bowen of Fauquier Co.,
         Virginia in May 1845. They had four children: Alwyn, Harriet
         (Hallie, to whom the letters are addressed), Ella, and Henry.
         In 1861 he was elected Captain of Company I, 11th Virginia
         Infantry Regiment, and was wounded in action at Dranesville in
         December 1861. He resigned from his unit in April 1863 and was
         hospitalized as late as September 1863. Jameson was arrested
         by Federal troops at Culpeper Court House, Virginia on March
         26, 1864, as "formerly a Captain in the C. S. A." and was sent
         to prison at Point Lookout, Maryland. Although he was
         ultimately exchanged, he did not survive the trip home. He
         became ill from the effects of his wound and imprisonment
         while traveling on a flag-of-truce boat to Richmond, and died
         September 30, 1864--approximately a month after writing the
         final letter to his daughter. He is buried at his wife's
         family home, "Belle Coil," Fauquier Co., Virginia.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The collection consists of two letters written in August
         1864 by James H. Jameson to his daughter, Hallie. Both letters
         were composed while he was a Confederate prisoner of war at
         Point Lookout Prison. Jameson discusses his failing health and
         his need for food.</p>

               <p>"Since I wrote I have been exceedingly feeble
               sometimes not able to walk. If I could get good
               Blackberry or Port wine the Physician says it would be
               very good for me. The best thing I could have. Your
               letter stating that you had sent me ten dollars came
               safely. The one containing the money I expect is in the
               hands of the Provost Marshall as we do not receive the
               money but get a book crediting us with the amount and
               can thus purchase things of the sutler. I feel a little
               better this morning but am exceedingly feeble."</p>
