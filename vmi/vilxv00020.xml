      <p>Clayton Glanville Coleman, physician, was born at Roxbury,
         New Kent County, Virginia in 1840. He entered the Virginia
         Military Institute in July 1856 as a member of the Class of
         1859, but did not graduate. After leaving VMI in 1858, he
         attended the University of Virginia and the Medical College of
         Virginia, from which he was graduated in March 1861. He served
         as Lt. Col., 23rd Virginia Infantry Regiment(1861-1862) and
         after September 1862 as a physician in the Confederate Medical
         Department. After the war, he continued the practice of
         medicine until 1871, when he became a Civil Engineer. He
         married Anna Sherrard Breedin, daugher of Enoch C. and Lucy
         Singleton Breedin, of Winchester Virginia. They had four
         children: Sherrard , Robert, Lucy, and Caroline. Clayton
         Coleman died October 7, 1908, in Little Rock, Arkansas.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers consist of three letters written to Coleman's
         sister Lucy during the Civil War, and an autograph album
         containing inscriptions written by his classmates at VMI, the
         University of Virginia, and the Medical College of Virginia,
         ca. 1858-61. The letter of September 17, 1862, from
         Winchester, Virginia, discusses the Battle of Antietam and
         caring for wounded; November 4, 1862, Winchester, Virginia,
         discusses hospitals and care of wounded, General George
         Steuart, movement of Longstreet's Corps, and other troop
         activity in the area; Feb 25, 1863 is largely personal,
         discussing his mother's death.</p>

            <p>Written at Winchester, Virginia. Coleman discusses
                  the Battle of Antietam and caring for wounded. 
                  <lb/>"....But the hottest battle of the war was
                  fought near Sharpsburg Md on the 17th inst. The
                  battle lasted all day and the loss was terrific on
                  both sides, the enemy fighting with more desperation
                  than ever before. We call it a victory and the
                  Yankees did so at first too; we held the ground and
                  both sides were too much worsted to renew the fight
                  next day. We fell back across the Potomac and the
                  enemy then commenced shelling us and boasted that
                  they had driven us across. They acknowledge the loss
                  of sixteen generals. We had two generals killed and
                  ten wounded. Winchester has been perfectly crowded
                  with the wounded---there having been more than 3000
                  here at one time and continually passing through. The
                  N. Y. Tribune says if we had followed them, their
                  army wd have been annihilated, and Gen. Lee says he
                  could have done so with 5000 more fresh troops. But
                  men had been marched so much and were so broken down,
                  that we had 60,000 stragglers...."</p>

                  troop activity in the area. 
                  <lb/>"....I have had my hands full ever since, for
                  upon arriving here I was assigned to the charge of
                  two Hospitals--the N. S. P. Church and Lovett House
                  Hospitals, containing more than one hundred sick and
                  wounded, and a great many very bad cases. But
                  although I have been until the last few days so
                  busily engaged, I have only lost five patients out of
                  one hundred and eighty treated, while other hospitals
                  have lost a much greater proportion. Dr. McGuire told
                  me that he lost fourteen patients on night before
                  last at the Union Hospital! There are not more than
                  one thousand sick here now...."</p>

                  her children before she died. But it is said that
                  everything happens for the best and we should bear
