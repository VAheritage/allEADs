      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Napoleon B. Brisbine, Civil War soldier, was a Surgeon
         serving with the 2nd Ohio Cavalry Regiment. This unit was
         engaged in the fighting at Winchester, Virginia in August
         1864, serving as a rear guard while the rest of the army
         retreated toward Harper's Ferry.</p>

    <scopecontent>
      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection consists of two Civil War letters written by
         Brisbine to his brother and sister. The items are dated
         September 16 and 24, 1864. In the first letter, Brisbine
         describes being held prisoner in Winchester, Virginia, where
         he was captured while caring for Union wounded. In the second,
         he describes the recapture of Winchester by Union troops and
         the Confederate retreat.</p>

               a prisoner in this place. On our retreat down the valley
               it fell to the lot of someone to stay with our wounded
               at this place and that unfortunate one was your humble
               servant...."</p>

               retreats I ever saw without any exception, and the
               horses, mules &amp; men all went along with their tails
               up (excuse the last remark, the latter's tails were
               down). The old 8th Corps done wonders in that day and
               redeemed itself from all other stains. While the rebels
               were retreating through town a shell from one of our
               Batteries came through our Hospital, going over two beds
               and striking the third one smashing it to splinters,
               tearing the straw out of the mattress and disappeared
               through the other side of the house, not hurting a man.
               The bed was occupied by a man with a fractured thigh but
               was not hurt. Sheridan is a trump, and is just whipping
               them as they go...."</p>
