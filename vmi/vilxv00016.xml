         <p>Alexander (Sandie) Swift Pendleton was born near
         Alexandria, Virginia on September 28, 1840. He was the only
         son of William Nelson Pendleton (Episcopal minister, educator,
         Confederate General) and Anzolette E. Page. The Pendleton
         family moved to Lexington, Virginia in October 1853, where
         William became rector at Grace Episcopal Church. Sandie
         Pendleton graduated from Washington College (now Washington
         &amp; Lee University) in 1857, and subsequently enrolled at
         the University of Virginia, where he was pursuing a Master of
         Arts degree when the Civil War began in April 1861.</p>
         <p>He received a commission as 2nd Lieutenant in Provisional
         Army of Virginia and reported to Harper's Ferry on June 14,
         1861. Within weeks, he was asked by General Stonewall Jackson
         to join his staff as an ordnance officer --- Jackson had known
         Pendleton from their days together in Lexington, where Jackson
         was a Professor at the Virginia Military Institute. Pendleton
         subsequently served as Jackson's Assistant Adjutant General
         (Second Corps), and the relationship between Pendleton and
         Jackson was a close one-- it was said that Jackson "loved him
         like a son." Following Jackson's death at Chancellorsville in
         May 1863, Pendleton remained as AAG under General Richard S.
         Ewell and would later serve under Gen. Jubal A. Early.
         Pendleton married Kate Corbin in December 1863, and the
         newlyweds were expecting their first child when he was
         mortally wounded at Fisher's Hill on September 22, 1863. He
         died on September 23, and in October his body was returned to
         Lexington for burial. Kate Corbin Pendleton gave birth to a
         son, Sandie, in November 1864. The child contracted diphtheria
         and died in September 1865.</p>
