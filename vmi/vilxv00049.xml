         <emph render="bold">Charles Marshall Barton</emph>, the eldest
         son of David and Frances (Fanny) Jones Barton, was born at
         Winchester, Virginia on November 30, 1836. He preparatory
         education was received at Winchester Academy and at Episcopal
         High School (Alexandria, VA). He entered the Virginia Military
         Institute in 1852 and graduated in 1856. He subsequently
         returned to the Winchester area where he was a farmer. Charles
         married Ellen Marshall, of Fauquier County, in 1859. During
         the Civil War he served with Cutshaw's Artillery Battery and
         was mortally wounded in action near Winchester on May 25,
         1862.</p>
         <p>
         <emph render="bold">Randolph Barton</emph>, Charles's younger
         brother, was born at Winchester on April 24, 1844. He attended
         the Virginia Military Institute for one year, 1860-1861, and
         at the beginning of the Civil War joined the 33rd Virginia
         Infantry Regiment. He subsequently served in the 2nd Virginia
         Infantry and as a staff officer for Generals Elisha F. Paxton,
         James A. Walker and William R. Terry. Following the war, he
         practiced law in Baltimore, Maryland. Randolph married Agnes
         P. Kirkland of Baltimore on December 29, 1869. They had nine
         children. He died on March 15, 1921.</p>
         <p>
         <emph render="bold">Bolling W. Barton</emph>, a younger
         brother of Charles and Randolph, was born at Winchester on
         November 24, 1846. He entered VMI on September 25, 1862 and
         while at the Institute took part in the Battle of New Market
         (Virginia) on May 15, 1864. In November 1864 he joined the 1st
         Foreign Battalion. After the Civil War he studied and
         practiced medicine, and also taught Botany at Johns Hopkins
         University. He married Ella Jane Gibson in 1872; the couple
         had no children. He died in Loudoun County, Virginia on
         February 18, 1924.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The collection consists of the miscellaneous papers of
         three members of the Barton family who attended the Virginia
         Military Institute during the mid-19th century. Papers
         relating to Cadet Charles M. Barton (VMI Class of 1856)
         include a letter dated September 28, 1855 from Charles to his
         cousin Joseph M. Barton, in which he complains about VMI life
         and about his instructor Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson
         (Jackson is described as a "hell of a fool"). Other Charles
         Barton material is found in a notebook (ca. 250 pages)
         containing poetry copied by Cadet Barton, including "The
         Faculty of the VMI" which describes Francis H. Smith, John
         T.L. Preston and other early faculty members; class notes from
         lectures given by Francis H. Smith; autographs of Barton's VMI
         classmates, and a resolution on the death of Cadet Thomas
         Blackburn.</p>
         <p>The notebook described above, although pertaining largely
         to Charles, also contains notes on law and notations
         concerning legal cases and fees. This material likely relates
         to Randolph Barton, an attorney.</p>
         <p>Material relating to Bolling W. Barton includes one letter
         from Frank [last name unknown, but a VMI alumnus] to Bolling,
         dated January 18, 1864; 6 miscellaneous documents, primarily
         French language exercises; and a photocopy of a typescript of
         a speech delivered by Bolling Barton to the Virginia Military
         Institute Class of 1912.</p>

               <p>Cadet Barton discusses life at VMI and complains
               about faculty member Thomas J. Jackson. 
               <lb />"I find the studies this years a great deal more
               interesting than they have been heretofore, with the
               exception of one single one, which so counterbalances
               the rest as to throw all the good part into the shade.
               We commenced studying engineering this year. I find the
               military engineering quite interesting &amp; I hope I
               may find civil equally so, as it is the only thing I
               care knowing anything about. The study I referred to
               just now was Optics, which from being so very difficult,
               &amp; taught by such a hell of a fool, whose name is
               Jackson."</p>
