      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Giles Gunn was born in Connecticut on December 19, 1825,
         most likely at Washington, Litchfield County. He was the son
         of John Northrup Gunn, Jr. (1798-1883) and Lora Smith
         (1800-1841), who were married on June 16, 1819. By 1848, Giles
         Gunn was working as a teacher in Lexington, Rockbridge County,
         Virginia, where he married Virginia W. Morrison of Rockbridge
         County on December 19, 1859. Virginia, the daughter of William
         and Mary Morrison, was twenty-four years old at the time of
         her marriage. Birth records indicate that the couple had
         several children, all born in Rockbridge: Lora (b. 1860),
         Johnella (b. 1871), Effa or Effie (b. 1875), Fred (b. 187?).
         This listing of children may not be complete. Giles Gunn died
         on November 24, 1892. No other biographical information was
         available at the time the collection was processed.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers consist of five letters (1848-1854) written by
         Giles Gunn, a native of Connecticut, while he was a
         schoolteacher in Lexington, Rockbridge County, Virginia. The
         letters, addressed primarily to his sister Mary (living at the
         Gunn home in Washington, Litchfield County, Connecticut),
         include discussions of interesting local events as well as
         references to family. Topics include commencement at the
         Virginia Military Institute; a detailed description of his
         school and his methods of instruction; a description of the
         communion service at a local church, including references to
         black communicants; references to the townspeople's reaction
         to a rumored slave insurrection; and a discussion of the
         murder of VMI Cadet Thomas Blackburn.</p>

               <lb/>"You would like to see them partake. A table is
               made in front of the pulpit and all that can get round
               it set down, then the minister at the head of the table
               cuts the bread, and blesses it, and gives it to another
               priest who takes it on one side of the table and passes
               it to each person and says 'may this emblem of the dying
               savior be blessed to your sanctification.' Thus a
               minister on each side of the table goes through with his
               ceremony and the same motions over the blood, or wine,
               then the head priest gives a short exhortation and a
               prayers and these rise and make room for another table
               full. Thus they go it till all have had a bite. Then
               they call upon the colored brethren, or part of the
               ministers do, to come down out of the gallery. In some
               of the churches they climb up to the gallery by a ladder
               on the outside and go in a the window."</p>
