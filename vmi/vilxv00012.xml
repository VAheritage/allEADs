        <p>The papers were formerly in the possession of the
            donors' grandfather and father. James Livingston Davis, the
            grandfather, was a lawyer in Bristol, Virginia, who came
            into possession of the papers in January 1903, shortly
            after the death of Abram Fulkerson. Subsequently, James's
            son, Judge Robert Bolton Davis, held the papers until his
            death in 1979. His heirs donated the papers to VMI.</p>

      <p><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">Samuel Vance Fulkerson,</title>a son of
         Col. Abram Fulkerson, Sr. and Margaret Vance, was born in
         Washington County, Virginia on October 21, 1822. As a young
         man he undertook the study of law, and in late 1846 he
         obtained his license and opened a practice in southwestern
         Virginia. Samuel served in the United States Army during the
         Mexican War (1847-1848), and subsequently returned to the
         practice of law in Estillville and Abingdon, Virginia. In 1857
         he was elected judge of the thirteenth judicial district and
         held this position until the beginning of the Civil War. He
         was a member of the Virginia Military Institute Board of
         Visitors from 1852-1854 and from 1857-1858. During the war, he
         served as Colonel of the 37th Virginia Infantry Regiment.
         Samuel was killed in the Battle of Gaines's Mill on June 26,
         1862; survivors included siblings (he did not marry).</p>
      <p><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">Abram Fulkerson, Jr.,</title>younger
         brother of Samuel V. Fulkerson, was born May 13, 1834 in
         Washington County, Virginia. He graduated from the Virginia
         Military Institute in 1857, and after a brief career as a
         teacher went on to study law. During the Civil War he served
         as Colonel of the 63rd Tennessee Infantry Regiment and was a
         prisoner of war (one of the "Immortal 600"). After the war he
         continued the practice of law and was active in politics,
         serving in the Virginia legislature and in the United States
         Congress. He married Selina Johnson, of Clarksville,
         Tennessee, in 1862; they had nine children, including Samuel
         Vance Fulkerson, VMI Class of 1884. Abram Fulkerson died at
         Bristol, Virginia on December 17, 1902.</p>
      <p><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">Samuel Vance Fulkerson</title>, the son
         of Abram Fulkerson, Jr. and Selina Johnson, was born at
         Abingdon, Virginia on October 22, 1863. He graduated from VMI
         in 1884 and subsequently studied law at the University of
         Virginia. He was a lawyer (partner in the firm of Fulkerson
         and Davis in Bristol, VA) and served two terms as City
         Attorney. During the Spanish-American War (1898- 1899) he was
         a member of the Fourth Tennessee Regiment, U.S. Volunteers.
         Samuel married Lura Bradley of Sherman, Texas in 1904; they
         had twin sons, born April 1906. He died July 2, 1926 at
         Virginia Beach, VA; he is buried at East Hill Cemetery,
         Bristol, VA.</p>

                     <lb/>War news; concerned about family- "In a
                     letter from Col. Gibson he asked what I wished you
                     and Kate to do in case the enemy got into our
                     county. If they should get in, and you are willing
                     to do so, I think that you had better remain at
                     home. Refugees have a hard time, and when people
                     leave their homes everything is destroyed. Mr.
                     Faulkner (Honl. Charles J.) told me that his wife
                     had saved his property by staying at home. But if
                     it should come to the worst, and you prefer it,
                     leave and let the property go. I care little for
                     the property except on yours and Kate's account.
                     For myself I feel that I have no home so long as
                     it is threatened by the enemy, and I would
                     willingly give up all I have, and commence the
                     world anew without a thing, rather than that the
                     enemy should subjugate us."</p>

                     <lb/>Battle of Kernstown. "The [people along the
                     valley] claim our fight as a victory, but it is
                     not so. We attacked a greatly superior forces and
                     were repulsed with heavy loss. If night had not
                     set in we would all have been captured or killed.
                     The enemy's loss was very heavy, for our men
                     fought with desperate courage."</p>
