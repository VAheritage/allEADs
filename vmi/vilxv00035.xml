      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Edward Sixtus Hutter was born on September 18, 1839 at the
         family home, Sanduskey [Sandusky], near Lynchburg, Virginia.
         He was the son of George Christian Hutter, a United States
         Army officer, and Harriet Risque. Hutter enrolled at the
         Virginia Military Institute (Lexington, Virginia) in 1856 and
         graduated in 1859, standing 5th out of 29 graduates. He
         subsequently read law with Judge John Brockenbrough in
         Lexington and then continued his legal education at the
         University of Virginia. While at the University (1860-1861) he
         was Captain of a local militia unit known as Captain E. S.
         Hutter's Company (Southern Guards).</p>
      <p>When the Civil War began in the Spring of 1861, Hutter's
         Company served briefly at Harpers's Ferry until the unit was
         disbanded on May 8, 1861. Hutter was then appointed 1st
         Lieutenant in the Provisional Army of Virginia and went on to
         serve in various capacities throughout the war. Among other
         duties, he was an aide to General J. E. B. Stuart, served in
         Capt. W. H. Otey's Company of Virginia Light Artillery, and
         commanded the Danville Arsenal. At war's end he held the rank
         of Major.</p>
      <p>After the war Hutter was in the insurance business and
         worked as a Civil Engineer. He married Nannie Langhorne of
         Lynchburg, VA on December 19, 1861. The couple had thirteen
         children. Hutter died at the home of one of his sons at
         Pittsville, Pittsylvania County, Virginia, on June 23, 1904.
         The body was returned to Lynchburg for burial.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection consists of the one volume diary of Virginia
         Military Institute Cadet Edward S. Hutter, covering the period
         January - December 1858. The earliest entries (Jan-March 19)
         were written while Hutter was on sick leave and contain mostly
         family references. Later entries mention VMI faculty members,
         friends, the Society of Cadets (a student debating club), room
         occupants, infractions noted while on Guard Duty, and other
         aspects of cadet life.</p>
