      <p>Thomas Hoomes Williamson was born August 30, 1813 in
         Richmond, Virginia, the son of Thomas and Anne Walke
         Williamson. He spent most of his childhood in Norfolk,
         Virginia, where he received his early schooling. He entered
         the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1829, but
         resigned in 1833 before receiving his degree. In 1834 entered
         the profession of Civil Engineering and was the assistant to
         the U. S. Engineer in charge of building the dry dock in the
         Norfolk Navy Yard. Williamson married Louisa Henrietta Fenton
         Garnett on May 11, 1837. The couple had five children before
         Louisa died in 1859-- Mercer, William, Anne, Thomas, and
         Olympia.</p>
      <p>In 1841, Williamson accepted a faculty appointment at the
         Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, where he was to
         spend the remainder of his career except for a brief absences
         during the Civil War. He taught tactics, drawing, and
         engineering, and at various times was assigned additional
         duties (Commandant of Cadets, Treasurer, Librarian). While at
         VMI he wrote a text book, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">An Elementary Course of Architecture
         and Civil Engineering</title>, for use by his students.</p>
      <p>Williamson took on various special assignments during the
         Civil War. In April 1861 he served with the Confederate
         Engineers Corps and worked on the defenses of the Rappahannock
         River and Manassas. In October of that year, he was ordered to
         return to VMI to teach Civil and Military Engineering, but he
         was recalled to the Confederate Army in April 1862 for
         temporary special duty on the staff of General Stonewall
         Jackson. In 1864 Williamson married for the second time. His
         new wife was a widow, Mrs. Julia Wharton (nee Lewis) of
         Lexington. She was the mother of his two youngest
         children--Sydney Bacon, and Cornelia.</p>
      <p>Williamson continued his teaching career at VMI until
         shortly before his death on March 31, 1888. He is buried in
         the Stonewall Jackson Cemetery in Lexington.</p>
