         <p>Charles Vaill Laughlin (1907-1985)was born in Pittsfield,
         Illinois on May 26, 1907. He married Hope Loraine Edson in
         1948. They had one adopted son. Laughlin was educated in
         public schools in Hopkinton, Iowa, and attended Lennox College
         in that same city. He earned both an L.L.B. in 1929 and an
         A.B. in 1930 from George Washington University. In 1940 he
         received an L.L.M. degree from Harvard University. He added a
         Doctor of Jurisprudence (J.S.D.) degree from the University of
         Chicago to his credentials in 1942. In 1957, he attended the
         Academy of International Law at the Hague, Netherlands.</p>
         <p>Laughlin practiced in law firms in Washington, D.C. and
         Chicago during the years 1929-1938. He taught political
         science at Lennox College in 1931-1932 and again in 1938-1939.
         In 1940 he began teaching law at Washington and Lee
         University. In 1942 Laughlin joined the U.S. Army seeing
         active duty with the Judge Advocate General's (JAG) Corps from
         1943 to 1946. He continued his service with the JAG corps as a
         reservist from 1946 to 1960. Returning to the W &amp; L Law
         School in 1946, Laughlin was made full professor in 1950. He
         taught there until his retirement in 1977 when he was named
         professor emeritus. Laughlin's fields of teaching
         specialization included evidence, jurisprudence, and labor
         law. Widely known as an authority in labor arbitration, he
         served as a federal labor arbitrator from 1973 to 1981.</p>
         <p>He accepted several visiting professorships during his
         career, most notably as a Fulbright lecturer in American law
         at the University of Helsinki, Finland in 1963-1964. Laughlin
         was published in numerous law reviews, and he wrote nineteen
         articles for the ABA Journal. He was a major contributor to
         the 1982 book Legal Education in Virginia, 1779-1979: A
         Biographical Approach published by the University Press of
         Virginia.</p>
         <p>A life-long Republican, Laughlin held positions in local
         and state party organizations throughout his career. He was
         twice a delegate to Republican state conventions (Iowa in 1932
         and Virginia in 1952.) In 1932, he was an unsuccessful
         candidate for the Iowa state legislature. He also served as
         chairman of the Lexington (Virginia) Electoral Board. He
         served as a U.S. Commissioner (later called U.S. Magistrate)
         during the years 1962-1974.</p>
         <p>Professor Laughlin died on January 29, 1985. The faculty
         lounge in the W &amp; L law school is named in his honor. In
         1977, the Law School Association announced the establishment
         of the Charles V. Laughlin Award, which is given each year to
         the outstanding oral advocate in the Burks Moot Court
         Competition.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The Charles V. Laughlin Papers consist of five cubic feet
         of papers from the years 1940-1981. They are arranged in seven
         series: Biographical Materials; U.S. Army Service; Washington
         and Lee School of Law; Research and Writing; Clerkship with
         Judge H. Emory Widener; U.S. Commissioner &amp; Magistrate
         Records; and Arbitration Cases.</p>
         <p>The Biographical Materials include a summary of Laughlin's
         war record, a biographical statement, and various membership
         cards.</p>
         <p>The U.S. Army Service is arranged in four series: "201
         File," diary, "log/meetings" of USAR School, and notebooks.
         These materials document Laughlin's activities while an active
         and reserve member of the Judge Advocate General's Corps. The
         "201 File" contains Laughlin's personal copies of documents
         from his official Army personnel file. The contents are well
         enumerated in the container list. The last element of this
         series is the History of the JA Section of the Headquarters
         Central Pacific Base Command, which Laughlin wrote for the
         JAG. This history discusses the mission, personnel,
         administrative decisions, military justice, claims and legal
         assistance of the JA. The diary and the other small notebooks
         document daily activities, meetings and courses attended.</p>
         <p>The Washington and Lee School of Law materials deal with
         Laughlin's service on the curriculum committee, Dean's search
         committee and as a recipient of the Robert E. Lee Research
         Grant.</p>
         <p>The Research and Writing materials related to two projects:
         Legal Education in Virginia, 1779-1979: A Biographical
         Approach and "Theory of a Two Party System". The Legal
         Education in Virginia materials include correspondence,
         biographical sketches, photocopied articles, and research
         notes pertaining to Washington and Lee Law School and its
         faculty. Laughlin collected information, including letters he
         had solicited from former students, and drafted biographical
         sketches of deceased W &amp; L law professors. Twenty-six of
         these sketches were included by editor W. Hamilton Bryson when
         this work was published in 1982 by the University Press of
         Virginia. Among the research materials gathered here is a copy
         of a draft of "Chapter XXIV School of Law" from Ollinger
         Crenshaw's General Lee's College The Rise and Growth of
         Washington and Lee University, 1969.</p>
         <p>The never published "Theory of a Two Party System" was
         written between 1961 and 1963. The work deals with political
         party dynamics in modern democratic society, particularly in
         the United States and England. An abstract of this work
         appears both in the "prospectus" and "preface."</p>
         <p>The record of proceedings documenting Laughlin's time as a
         United States Commissioner (1962-1971) and Magistrate
         (1972-1974) consists of forms summarizing the facts of each
         case and giving Laughlin's judgement. These are arranged
         chronologically. There is also one case file associated with
         Laughlin's service as commissioner.</p>
         <p>The series concerning Laughlin's Clerkship with Judge H.
         Emory Widener (1974- 1979) of the U.S. 4th Circuit Court
         begins with one folder of materials concerning the uniform
         commercial code. The remainder of the materials consists of
         research, writing and correspondence relating to each case
         that Laughlin work on. These are arranged by the case docket
         numbers. This was, apparently, a "clerkship by mail", as there
         is no evidence that Laughlin--who was on the faculty when
         Widener was a student at W &amp; L law school--was every in
         residence in Judge Widener's chambers. This index lists 55
         arbitrated cases, only 26 of which are represented in these
         papers. The index provides a notification number, date of
         notification, source of notification, source number, reason
         for continuance, grievant, employer, union, issue, hearing
         number, date of hearing, place of hearing, date of deposition,
         type, remarks and citations. An annotated explanation and
         comments sheet accompanies the index of cases.</p>
         <p>The Labor Arbitration materials consist primarily of
         records of Laughlin's work as an arbitrator for the U.S.
         Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. These records are
         arranged by case number. Each file contains a worksheet;
         correspondence; depositions and transcripts; exhibit;, briefs;
         and union agreements. An index to the docket of cases
         arbitrated precedes all of the case files.</p>
         <p>These case files are followed by five cases in which
         Laughlin acted as a consultant or as an arbitrator, but not,
         apparently, under the auspices of the U.S. Federal Mediation
         and Conciliation Service. Finally, there are papers concerning
         Laughlin's labor relations consulting work with the Chamber of
         Commerce and Industry of Willemstad, Curacao, Netherlands
         Antilles.</p>
