      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Born in West Virginia in 1873, John William Davis went to
         college and law school at Washington and Lee University taking
         his LL.B degree in 1895. Having already read law for a year in
         his father's office, Davis completed the law degree
         requirements in nine months. After practicing for a year in
         West Virginia, he accepted a position as the third member of
         the expanded law faculty at Washington and Lee. During the
         1897 school year, Dean John Randolph Tucker died and Davis had
         to take on the additional load of teaching Tucker's classes.
         Though tempted to stay on at Washington and Lee under the
         leadership of the new president, William L. Wilson, Davis
         chose the "rough &amp; tumble" of private practice. Two years
         later, when Professor Charles Graves left Washington and Lee
         to accept a chair at the University of Virginia, he was again
         invited to join the permanent faculty. Davis again selected
         private practice over teaching. He remained loyal to
         Washington and Lee and later served more that two decades on
         its board of trustees.</p>
      <p>Davis practiced law in Clarksburg from 1897 to 1913. During
         this period he was active in West Virginia and national
         Democratic politics. He was elected to the West Virginia House
         of Delegates in 1899 and, from 1911-1913, he served in the
         U.S. Congress. In 1912 he married Ellen G. Bassell. (He had
         married Julia McDonald in 1899. She died in childbirth a year
         later.) From 1913-1918 he served as U. S. Solicitor general.
         In September 1918, Davis was one of the delegates to the
         Berne, Switzerland conference on the treatment and exchange of
         Prisoner. From 1918 until 1921 he was ambassador to Great
         Britain. In 1921 Davis moved from London to New York to become
         head of the prominent Wall Street law firm Davis, Polk and
         Wardwell. Clients included J. P. Morgan and Company, and U. S.
         Steel.</p>
      <p>In 1922, the same year he served as president of the
         American Bar Association, Davis rejected appointment to the U.
         S. Supreme Court. In 1924 he became the Democratic nominee for
         president. He waged a conservative, high-minded and losing
         campaign against Calvin Coolidge. He left the political arena,
         only reemerging briefly in the 1930's as an organizer of the
         anti-New Deal Liberty league.</p>
      <p>For the rest of his career, he devoted himself to his
         private practice. By his death in 1955 he had made 139 oral
         arguments before the Supreme Court, at the time a 20th century
         record. Davis was honored in his lifetime by fourteen honorary
         doctorates. Felix Frankfurter, Learned Hand, and Hugo Black,
         among others, deemed him one of the two or three finest
         advocates of the century.</p>
      <p>Davis' lifelong fidelity to the conservative legal
         principles espoused by his father and by the Washington and
         Lee law faculty at the time he was a student make for a
         seemingly inconsistent record of advocacy. He may be best
         remembered for successfully defending the steel industry
         against government seizure during the Korean War, and for
         unsuccessfully arguing South Carolina's case for maintaining
         segregated schools in the school desegregation cases now known
         jointly as Brown v. Board of Education. But Davis' second case
         as Solicitor General made a strong argument against Oklahoma's
         "grandfather clause" excluding blacks from voting (Guinn v.
         United States). He spoke in defense of religious liberty in
         the 1928 presidential campaign when candidate Al Smith was
         attacked because of his Catholicism. In a 1931 pro bono case,
         Davis defended a Yale divinity professor in a case (United
         States v. Macintosh) that became a leading precedent in the
         development of the law of conscientious objection. During the
         Cold War, Davis was contemptuous of McCarthyite tactics. He
         was involved both in the Alger Hiss case and in preparing the
         appeal of J. Robert Oppenheimer to the Atomic Energy
         Commission for security clearance.</p>

          <p>Researchers should note that the bulk of the papers
               of John W. Davis are held by Yale University Libraries.
               (Washington and Lee University School of Law Library
               holds a copy of the microfilm edition of this Yale
               collection. The film is housed in the microforms area of
               the law library Main Reading Room.) The Special
               Collections division of Washington and Lee University
               Leyburn Library also holds a small collection of Davis
               materials. These include a speech typescript, his
               original law license, correspondence and asset
               statements. The papers of the parents of John W. Davis,
               John J. Davis and Julia McDonald Davis, are held by West
               Virginia University.</p>

          <p>Davis' law firm, Davis, Polk &amp; Wardwell, at an
               unrecorded date, donated c. 50 linear feet of court
               reports and other printed records of cases in which
               Davis participated. These had been specially bound and
               titled "Cases and Points." A shelf list of these volumes

        <p>Twenty one books belonging to John W. Davis were
            donated with this material. All of these books are
            housed in the law library Rare Book Room. They have not
            been entered into the library catalog, but a list of the
            titles is available at the repository. Additionally, an
            English Staffordshire porcelain figurine of a pair of
            birds is on indefinite display in the anteroom to the
            Law Librarian's office.</p>
