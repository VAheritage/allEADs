      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Henry St. George Tucker was born in Winchester, Virginia in
         1853. He was educated in Virginia, attending a private school
         in Richmond, prepatory school at Middleburg, and graduating
         from the law department of Washington and Lee University,
         Lexington, in 1876. In that same year he was admitted to the
         bar and began practice in Staunton, Virginia.</p>
      <p>Tucker was elected as a Democrat to the Fifty-first,
         Fifty-second, Fifty-third, and Fifty-fourth Congresses (March
         4, 1889-March 3, 1897). He did not run for reelection in
         1896.</p>
      <p>He was appointed professor of constitutional law and equity
         at Washington and Lee University in 1897, succeeding his
         father, John Randolph Tucker, who had died that same year. In
         1900, he was appointed dean of the law school. After serving
         as acting president of Washington and Lee for one year, Tucker
         took the position of dean of the school of law of Columbian
         (now George Washington) University, Washington, DC in
         1905.</p>
      <p>Tucker also served as president of the Jamestown
         Tercentennial Exposition in 1904-1905, and as president of the
         American Bar Association in 1905. He was an unsuccessful
         candidate for the nomination for Virginia governor in both
         1909 and 1921. He edited Tucker On Constitutional Law, Woman
         Suffrage by Constitutional Amendment, and Limitations on the
         Treaty Making Power.</p>
      <p>Elected as a Democrat to the Sixty-seventh Congress to fill
         the vacancy caused by the death of Henry D. Flood, Tucker was
         reelected to the Sixty-eighth and to the four succeeding
         Congresses, serving from March 21, 1922 until his death. At
         the time of his death in Lexington, Virginia on July 23, 1932
         , Tucker had already been nominated for reelection to the
         Seventy-third Congress.</p>

          <p>This volume includes traditional printing, mechanical
               reproduction of handwritten notes by the author, and the
               handwritten notes of Henry St. George Tucker. The
               printed material in the volume was written in 1870-1871
               -- apparently by Prof. R. S. McCulloch -- and
               copyrighted in 1872. Tucker took this course in
               1874-1875.</p>

          <p>This volume consists of a printed "index
               alphabetically arranged of the titles generally used in
               the practice and study of the law," followed by 316
               ruled and numbered pages. On these some of these pages,
               Henry St. George Tucker and later his son, John R.
               Tucker, recorded relevant notes and case citations keyed
               to the printed index. The volume was published in 1876.
               It was used by the Tuckers until at least 1903. There is
               also a record for this item in the Washington and Lee
               University OPAC (classified as: KF 387 L39 1876).</p>
