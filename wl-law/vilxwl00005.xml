         portions of these papers were placed on permanent loan at
         Washington and Lee University Library Special Collections by
         Stephen A. Sharp in December 1974. There is no record of when
         the FCC papers arrived there. Because the impeachment inquiry
         papers in the Sharp papers complement those in the M. Caldwell
         Butler papers, the Sharp collection was transferred to the
         Powell Archives in the Washington and Lee University School of
         Law in March 1993. This was done with the permission of the
         brother of the lender, Matthew T. Sharp, who held the
         power-of-attorney for Stephen Sharp.</origination>

      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Stephen A. Sharp was born in Columbus, Ohio and raised in
         Wooster, Ohio. He received his B.A. degree from Washington and
         Lee University in 1969, and his J.D. degree from the
         University of Virginia in 1973.</p>
      <p>Sharp took a leave of absence from law school to serve as
         communications director of the 1970 Tennessee gubernatorial
         campaign of Winfield Dunn. He went on to serve temporarily as
         news secretary and special assistant to the Governor-elect
         before returning to law school.</p>
      <p>He joined the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in
         1972 in the Office of the General Counsel, and ultimately
         served in every division of that office. He resigned from the
         Commission in January 1974 to serve as counsel to the
         Impeachment Inquiry of the Committee on the Judiciary of the
         U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>Sharp returned to the Commission at the end of the inquiry,
         and in January 1975 moved to the Litigation Division,
         representing the FCC in appellate litigation in the U.S.
         Circuit Courts of Appeals and the Supreme Court. At that time
         he also served as the chief advisor to the General Counsel
         concerning political broadcasting and the fairness doctrine.
         In September 1976, he moved to the office of FCC Commissioner
         Margita E. White as legal assistant.</p>
      <p>He resigned from the Commission in December 1978 to become
         associated with the law firm of Schnader, Harrison, Segal
         &amp; Lewis in its Washington office. In 1981, Sharp returned
         to the FCC as General Counsel. In 1982, President Ronald
         Reagan nominated Sharp to be an FCC Commissioner, a position
         he held until 1983. In August 1983, he joined the law firm of
         Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom in order to establish a
         telecommunications group within the firm. He was later of
         counsel to the law firm of Patton, Boggs &amp; Blow while
         serving as President of Spectrum Consumer Products Company of
         Alexandria, Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>These papers document three specific aspects of the career
         of Stephen A. Sharp: 1) His work as communications director
         for the 1970 campaign to re-elect Winfield Dunn as governor of
         Tennessee; 2) His service as Associate Minority Counsel to the
         House Judiciary Committee 1974 Presidential Impeachment
         Inquiry; and 3) His work as the chief advisor to the Federal
         Communications Commission General Counsel concerning political
         broadcasting and the fairness doctrine, 1976-1980.</p>
      <p>Winfield Dunn campaign papers, 4.5 cu.ft., include: public
         opinion polling research; releases; notes; daily campaign
         schedules; and press clippings. Also included are 7 audio
         cassette recordings of interviews with: Winfield Dunn, John J.
         Hooker, Jr., Bill Jenkins, Jack McNeil, Claude Robertson, and
         Stanley T.Snodgrass.</p>
      <p>The U.S. House Judiciary Committee Impeachment Inquiry,
         36.5 cu.ft., papers deal mainly with investigations of Richard
         M. Nixon Presidential campaign financing, and the role of
         Herbert Kalmbach in these activities. Materials include:
         committee research materials arranged in numbered ring
         binders; minority counsel internal memoranda; and printed
         Congressional reports and documents. Some processing has been
         done in this subgroup. A detailed listing of folder and
         publication titles is included in the container list. The
         materials are listed and housed in the order in which they
         were received. Certain overarching delineations appear
         including: Kalmbach and Campaign Financing, Materials re
         Kalmbach, Campaign Financing Materials and Sharp
         Notebooks.</p>
      <p>The Federal Communications Commission papers, 5 cu. ft.,
         deal almost exclusively with the application of the Fairness
         Doctrine by television networks during the 1976 elections.
         Materials include: Legislative histories and other research
         materials about the fairness doctrine; complaints and
         pleadings of candidates and organizations; and Sharp memos,
         notes and research materials from his work in response to
         these complaints.</p>
