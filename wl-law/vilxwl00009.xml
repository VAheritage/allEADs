      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection incorporates very small accessions
received in no documentary context. All materials deal with
the history of the School of Law at Washington and Lee
University and its predecessor institutions, or with alumni
of this law school.</p> <p>In October 2016, the collection was reappraised. Some materials were removed to be placed on other collection or disposed of because they did not have continuing value. Box and folder numbers were assigned and decimal numbers were assigned to each descrete collection within this collection.</p>

          <p>These materials, removed from crumbling scrapbook
pages, were received in 1996 (accession # 96-2m) from
Lewis Tyree, son of the collector of these items. Though
Tyree served briefly on the law school faculty, these
materials are from his time as a law student at
Washington and Lee. There is one folder of printed
invitations and programs. All other materials are
photographs of students, faculty and events. Seven
photos of law faculty members have been separated from
this collection and filed in the law school archives
faculty photo series.</p>

          <p>Found item, possibly formerly housed with rare books before their move to archives. Approximately 12" x 8" x .75" printed notebook with printed label "Law Notes Washington and Lee University" on the front cover. Notes appear to be from the 19th century, when compared to dated notes. Notes seem to have been made from reading books, rather than from lectures. There are no identifying markings (excepting "Vol. IV" written on inside cover) indicating who made the notes. There are 319 pages. Notes are made through p. 317, mostly on the right hand side of opened volume.</p>

</head>
<p>Nathan Philemon Bryan (April 23, 1872 - August 8, 1935) was born near Fort Mason, Orange County (now Lake County), Florida, the son of a planter, John Milton Bryan, and his wife, the former Louise Margaret Norton. . He attended the common schools but graduated from Emory College, Oxford, Georgia (now Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia), in 1893. He graduated from the the Washington and Lee University School of Law, Lexington, Virginia, in 1895 and was admitted to the bar that same year. Bryan began practicing law in 1895 in Jacksonville, Florida. He chaired the Board of Control of the Florida State Institutions of Higher Education from 1905 to 1909.</p>
<p>Bryan became a United States Senator for Florida by appointment on February 22, 1911.  Shortly after that, the legislature elected him to that position as a Democrat on March 4, 1911. He served as Senator until March 3, 1917, having been an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1916. He chaired the Committee on Claims in the Sixth-third and Sixty-fourth Congresses. He declined the appointment as Governor General of the Philippine Islands by President Woodrow Wilson in 1917.</p>
<p>Bryan returned to the practice of law and also became a trustee of Emory University. On April 23, 1920, Bryan was nominated by President Woodrow Wilson to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to a seat vacated by Robert Lynn Batts. He was confirmed by the United States Senate and received commission the same day. He held this position until his death.</p> 
<p>Nathan's brother, William James Bryan (October 10, 1876 â March 22, 1908), was also born in Orange County Florida.  In his short life, he was a politician, attorney, prosecutor and a Democratic U.S. Senator from Florida.</p> 
<p>Bryan attended public schools, graduating from Osceola High School of Kissimmee, Florida. He  gained admission to Emory College in Oxford, Georgia (forerunner of today's Emory University) at the age of 16, graduating with a B.A. degree in 1896. Following graduation, Bryan taught school for one year and worked on a plantation for another, all the while studying for law school. Bryan then enrolled in the Washington and Lee University School of Law in Lexington, Virginia, from which he graduated in 1899. He was admitted to the bar that same year and began the practice of law in Jacksonville, Florida.</p> 
<p>In 1903 Bryan married Janet G. Allan.  The couple had two children.</p> 
<p>In 1902 Bryan was elected as Duval County solicitor in its Criminal Court of Record. He was re-elected to this office in 1906, remaining in that capacity throughout 1907.</p> 
<p> The day after Christmas 1907, Bryan was appointed to fill a vacancy in the Unites States Senate. About a month after his arrival in the nation's capital, Bryan was stricken with typhoid fever, an illness which caused his premature death on March 22, 1908, at the age of 31. Bryan was buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Jacksonville, Florida.
