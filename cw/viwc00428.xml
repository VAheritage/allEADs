            <head>Biographical Information </head>
            <p>Dr. William Pasteur was a notable figure in Colonial Williamsburg, establishing his
                first Williamsburg apothecary shop in 1759, forming a partnership with his
                Williamsburg competitor, Dr. John Minson Galt, in 1775, and served as mayor of
                Williamsburg between 1775 and 1776. Pasteur retired from the Pasteur and Galt
                Apothecary in 1778. In his will, Pasteur empowered his executors to sell his lands
                in Goochland and all his personal property except for his slaves. He directed the
                executors to apply the proceeds of the sale to the payment of his debts, gave
                specific bequests to particular slaves, and left what did not sell, along with a
                bequest of 500 Pounds, to his wife Elizabeth. </p>
