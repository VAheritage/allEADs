         <p>Edmund Dickinson was a cabinetmaker in Williamsburg,
         Virginia.1 He was born in Norfolk and, although it is unclear
         when he moved to Williamsburg, he was listed as an employee of
         Anthony Hay in 1764. Hay operated a shop on Nicholson Street
         [Block 28, Building 72] that passed into the hands of
         Dickinson in 1771.2 Dickinson made furniture for prominent
         Virginians such as Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson, and he
         advertised in The Virginia Gazette on several occasions. He
         was elected captain of recruits from the District of York on
         February 4, 1776. He served in the 1st Virginia Regiment,
         reaching the rank of major in October 1777. He camped with the
         army at Valley Forge and died at the Battle of Monmouth in
         1778.3 George Washington specifically mentioned Dickinson's
         death in his personal correspondence. In a letter to Governor
         Patrick Henry on July 4, 1778, General Washington stated that
         the loss of Major Dickinson "ought much to be regretted by his
         friends and Countrymen as he possessed every qualification to
         render him eminent in the Military line."4 Although Dickinson
         was a bachelor at the time of his death, he was survived by
         his five sisters: Agnes Dickinson, Lucy Dickinson, Judith
         Farrer, Elizabeth Warren, and Mary.</p>
         <p>Lucy married Robert Gibbons after her brother had died.
         Louisa Gibbons, the daughter of Lucy and Robert, married
         William Smart. William Robert Smart (b. 1827) was their son.
         It appears that Lucy and Robert Gibbons were responsible for
         initiating the claim to Dickinson's military pension and land
         grants. In 1798, Senator Tazewell regretfully informed the
         Gibbons family that only the direct descendants of soldiers
         (wives and children) were entitled to military benefits from
         service during the Revolutionary War. William Smart continued
         the claim in 1832. The governor of Virginia eventually awarded
         Dickinson's heirs land, in addition to the land bounty that
         had been granted in the early 1780s.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The Dickinson collection contains a total of 28 pieces,
         including one letter from Edmund B. Dickinson (?-1778) and
         several letters from his collateral descendants that document
         their attempts to obtain land grants and pensions for
         Dickinson's military service during the Revolutionary War. The
         letter from Dickinson was written to his sister Lucy while at
         Valley Forge, and he makes reference to the newly established
         alliance with France. The collection contains a letter from
         Senator Henry Tazewell, a noted Virginia politician.
         Transcriptions are available for many of the documents in the
         collection. Colonial Williamsburg also has a portrait of
         Edmund Dickinson, which was probably painted in the 1770s. The
         portrait is housed in the Department of Collections.</p>
