<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Journal and correspondence of Adam Cuninghame. The journal of Adam Cuninghame records his voyage to Virginia from Scotland, April 4-October 21, 1728. Cuninghame recounts the many adventures of the ship and its crew who were fired upon by a French vessel, lost a man overboard who was killed by sharks, ran out of provisions and liquor (the latter due to theft by the transports), endured a hurricane, and were at the mercy of a drunken captain who often failed to leave his cabin for days at a time. </p>
<p>Cuninghame wrote two letters from King George County, Virginia to his father, William, in Glasgow. In the first letter dated August 2, 1729, Cuninghame describes Williamsburg as "but a small Village containing not 60 families at most." Cuninghame explained to his father that there were too many physicians in Williamsburg for him to be successful there. In the second letter dated May 24, 1730, Cuninghame wrote concerning his continuing troubles at making a living and his indebtedness. Cuninghame explained to his father that the way to wealth in Virginia was not through the practice of medicine but through trade explaining that this is how his fellow Scotsmen, Alexander McKenzie and Dr. Archibald Blair made their fortunes.</p>
<p>
 In a final letter written to his father from Newcastle upon Tyne, March 23, 1736, Cuninghame requested a secret meeting with his father. Cuninghame asked his father for financial assistance and informed him of his desire to be transported "to some Forreign Plantations where I may pass the remainder of my days in a Sincere repentance for my former folly."

<p>Concerning his decision to leave Williamsburg Adam writes: "please to know that Williamsburgh is but a small Village containing not 60 families at most; and in and about this City are no less than 25 or 30 phisishians [sic] and of that number not above 2 capaple [sic] of living handsom[e]ly." Cuninghame goes on to describe the expense of living in Williamsburg, his failed attempt to become a ship's surgeon and his indebtedness to Dr. Blair.

<p>Cuninghame writes to his father detailing his struggles in Virginia. In part, he ascribes his difficulties to his own charitable nature writing: "I cannot see a poor planter asking my advice, or begging my medicines, without being touch't with pity and freely give him away the Druggs have cost me above 150 p cent. in this country. I must own indeed I do my endeavour to make it up witht the richer sort, but these gentlemen are so very carefull not to fall sick, as I almost despaire of making any thing of them." Cuninghame goes on to explain that physicians in Virginia attain wealth by becoming merchants not by practing medicine. "... in my humble opinion there is no way of making mony in this country so easy as by merchandizing, this being the occupation they all aime [sic]at, for after they have purchas'd a little stock by there [sic] Practice they presently commence Merchants, and so make their Fortune." Cuninghame explains that this is the route taken by Alexander McKenzie and Doctor Archibald Blair.
