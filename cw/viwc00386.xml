            <p>John Clayton was born in 1694 in Fulham, Middlesex, and brought up in comparative
                wealth until 1715 when he emigrated to Virginia joining his father, John Clayton
                senior, who became Attorney General for the colony between 1713 and 1737. John
                Clayton junior was educated in law and, in 1720, took up a post as Clerk to the
                County Court of Gloucester County which he was to hold until he was seventy-nine.
                Soon after taking up the post he married Elizabeth Whiting and they moved into their
                new residence, believed to have been called Windsor, close to the Pianketank River.
                Records show they also owned a sizeable garden and plantation, though the precise
                whereabouts of these and the Clayton home remain uncertain. John and Elizabeth had
                eight children; five boys, the eldest called John, and three girls. Claytonís
                interest in natural history probably stemmed from his friendship with Mark Catesby
                (1682-1749), the artist and naturalist, who first arrived in Virginia in 1712.
                Clayton probably joined Catesby on the Spotswood expedition to the Blue Ridge
                Mountains and later, in about 1734, started collecting material to send to Catesby
                who by this time was back in England. Catesby in turn passed these specimens on to
                J.F. Gronovius (1690-1762), and encouraged Clayton to continue sending specimens to
                Europe. Clayton, disappointed at the lack of recognition that his collecting efforts
                should have justified, had determined, around 1760, to prepare a new Flora of
                Virginia. However, the publication of a second edition of Gronoviusí flora in 1762
                led Collinson to advise Clayton to search for a publisher in America, but none was
                found and any hope of its publication died with Clayton in 1773. </p>
