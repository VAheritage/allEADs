        <p>In processing this collection, an effort has been made
            to preserve the organization Durant used for his
            photographic materials. Negatives arrived in good order,
            filed in metal cabinets with index tabs identifying broad
            subject categories and individual identifications on
            negative envelopes providing more specific information.
            This arrangement is recorded in the computerized negative
            log, which was prepared by taking negatives from the
            drawers in consecutive order and entering their
            identifications into the computer.</p>
        <p>Photoprints, slides, and oversize prints arrived in
            boxes in a less discernible order. They have been sorted
            and filed according to the subject categories Durant used
            for his negatives. Framed photos were removed from their
            frames except for those which were fused to the glass. Most
            photos were also removed from acidic mats, unless the mats
            were considered to have artifactual significance. In
            instances where there more than two copies of the same
            image in a particular format, the two images in the best
            condition were selected for retention and the others were
            returned to the donor. Slides, negatives, and prints which
            were extremely deteriorated were also weeded out of the
            collection.</p>

      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Albert Wadsworth Durant was born on February 2, 1920 in New
         York City to Samuel and Bessie Durant. His mother was a native
         of Williamsburg who moved with her husband to New York and
         worked as a domestic servant for a family. After the death of
         her husband, who was originally from the West Indies, Bessie
         Durant and her children re-located to Williamsburg, Virginia
         in 1929.</p>
      <p>At age 36, Durant married Elsie Lucille Ferguson on August
         18, 1956. They raised three sons, Albert W. Durant, Jr., Byron
         Murphy, and Roderick Ferguson and two daughters, Yvette Durant
         and Deanna Ferguson.</p>
      <p>Albert Durant ran his own chauffeuring and limousine
         business in the Williamsburg area, providing services to many
         distinguished visitors to the city, including the Queen Mother
         of England, the Prince of Japan, and various chief justices.
         He often took his customers on excursions to local historic
         sites, including Colonial Williamsburg, Jamestown, and the
         James River plantations. Through course work at the College of
         William and Mary, Durant acquired a background in American
         history which enabled him to provide historical commentary as
         he drove customers through the countryside.</p>
      <p>Durant's contacts at the College of William and Mary
         sparked his initial interest in photography and once he had
         obtained equipment and training, Durant began creating his own
         historical record of the Williamsburg area. As the first city
         licensed black photographer in Williamsburg, Durant produced
         hundreds of portraits documenting the families and activities
         of African-American residents and also documented significant
         events, places, and person in and around Williamsburg.</p>
      <p>In addition, Albert Durant worked to improve the conditions
         for African-Americans in Williamsburg by serving in various
         positions in the city's government. He acted as the first
         black Justice of the Peace and Bail Commissioner in
         Williamsburg and served as the first black magistrate of the
         General District Court from his appointment in 1962 until his
         retirement in 1975.</p>
      <p>Albert Durant died at age 71 on April 14, 1991.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Albert Durant Photography Collection encompasses
         photoprints, negatives, slides, and personal papers which
         document the photographic production of Williamsburg's first
         black city-licensed photographer, Albert Durant. In addition,
         these materials offer a visual archive of the African-American
         experience in Williamsburg between the 1930s and 1960s.</p>
      <p>African-American family life is documented in both formal
         and informal family portraits and portraits of infants and
         children. Family events, such as birthdays, anniversaries,
         weddings, funerals, and holiday celebrations, are also
         represented in formal group portraits and candid shots of
         events taking place.</p>
      <p>The collection provides a fascinating glimpse into
         African-American social life in Williamsburg during the 1940s
         and 1950s. Durant captures the atmosphere of local jazz and
         nite clubs through scenes of performers singing and dancing
         and audiences socializing. Many different taverns and clubs
         are represented, including Yorkie's Tavern in Lightfoot, Va.,
         the Hillside Cafe Beer Garden, and various clubs in West Point
         and Hampton. Entertainers pictured in the images include
         Grant's Trio, Mell-O-Tones, and the Atomic Swingsters. Since
         Durant occasionally took trips to New York to meet members of
         well-known blues and jazz bands, the collection also features
         a few portraits of such musicians as Count Basie.</p>
      <p>Durant also acted as photographer for many African-
         American clubs and organizations. Along with taking formal
         group portraits, he documented these groups through informal
         shots of meetings, dinners, and special events. Many
         African-American women's clubs dedicated to social reform, as
         well as women's missionary circles, are documented in these
         photos. The series of club portraits also encompasses
         occupational groups, such as hairdresser's clubs and doctor's
         conventions, as well as garden clubs, musical performance
         groups, hunting and fishing clubs, and community service
         groups. Several African-American organizations dedicated to
         fighting for civil rights are also represented, including the
         Yorktown Chapter of the National Association for the
         Advancement of Corlored People.</p>
      <p>African-American student life during the late 1940s and
         early 1950s is also featured in this visual archive. Durant
         acted as a portrait photographer for Junior-Senior Proms at
         local black high schools and also documented the sports teams,
         marching bands, choirs, students, and faculty at Bruton
         Heights School in Williamsburg. The series of images he
         categorized as relating to "School Affairs" encompasses
         Homecoming parades and assemblies, football and basketball
         teams, theater productions, graduation portraits, and group
         portraits of classes, clubs, and faculty at various high
         schools. His negative identifications for this series indicate
         that he photographed students at Frederick Douglas School,
         James Weldon Johnson School in Yorktown, Charles City School,
         Bruton Heights School, Mathew Whaley School, and at various
         schools in Isle of Wight and Charles City counties.</p>
      <p>Various clubs and student organizations are featured in
         images of parades in Williamsburg and Smithfield. Among the
         parades represented are the College of William and Mary's
         Homecoming parades, a Shriner parade, and a parade celebrating
         the 250th Anniversary of Williamsburg. These photos show
         various floats prepared by such groups as the Puritan Club,
         the Junior Women's Club, the Smithfield Players, and college
         glee clubs and fraternities and sororities.</p>
      <p>A popular summer recreational area for Williamsburg's
         African-Americans in the 1940s and 1950s was Log Cabin Beach.
         Durant took dozens of souvenir portraits of men, women, and
         children at this beach along James River. The collection
         includes numerous examples of these souvenir portraits, some
         of which are still in their original mats with the Log Cabin
         Beach inscription.</p>
      <p>African-American spiritual life is also well-documented by
         the collection. Durant photographed church groups, such as
         choirs and missionary circles, as well as individuals
         participating in rituals, at many different black churches in
         the Williamsburg area. Included in this collection are
         negatives and photoprints of members of the congregations of
         Mt. Gilead Baptist Church in Grove, Va., New Zion Baptist
         Church in Lightfoot, Va., First Baptist Church in
         Williamsburg, Va., and several other Baptist churches in the
         area. A series of photos also captures Baptist ministers
         performing full-immersion baptisms in a river.</p>
      <p>Occupations, working conditions, and business opportunities
         for African-Americans in Williamsburg are also documented in
         this collection. The photos show African-Americans working in
         restaurants, beauty and barber shops, stores, offices, dry
         cleaners, and gas stations. Since he often picked up customers
         at the Williamsburg Inn and Williamsburg Lodge, Durant enjoyed
         photographing other chaffeurs and taxi drivers waiting at the
         hotels, as well as African-American porters and bell captains
         who were stationed at the entrances. African-American costumed
         interpreters at Colonial Williamsburg are also captured in
         some of his informal portraits.</p>
      <p>Durant compiled a photographic record of the white
         community in Williamsburg in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s as he
         fulfilled commissions for wedding pictures, school portraits,
         businesses, nightclubs, organizations, and special events.
         Since he chauffered many distinguished visitors around
         Williamsburg, Durant had opportunities to capture the visits
         of such heads of state as Queen Elizabeth of Great Britain and
         the Prince of Japan. In addition, Durant photographed various
         members of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s family at Bassett Hall
         and at various sites around the Historic Area.</p>
      <p>Colonial Williamsburg's buildings, employees, and programs
         are also featured in many photos. As part of his photography
         business, Durant prepared Christmas photo cards with snow
         scenes of the Historic Area. In addition, he took a series of
         color slides which document the filming of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">The Story of a Patriot,</title>"
         the official orientation film still in use at Colonial
         Williamsburg's Visitor's Center. Durant also took many posed
         portraits of both white and African-American costumed
         interpreters who worked in the Historic Area.</p>
      <p>Crime, accidents, and disasters in Williamsburg were also
         recorded on film by Durant, who appers to have provided
         photographic services to the Police Department. A series of
         photos provides a graphic visual record of a fire at the Brick
         House Tavern in the Historic Area. Durant also recorded
         automobile accidents and police investigations.</p>
      <p>Other local events commemorated in Durant's photos include
         the trial run of the S.S. United States, a ship built by the
         Newport News Shipyard and Drydock Co. (now known as Newport
         News Shipbuilding.) This series of photos documents staff on
         board the ship, as well as the interiors of various rooms and
         the exterior of the ship. Durant also compiled photographic
         documentation of the groundbreaking for the Anheuser-Busch
         plant and of the Bicentennial at Yorktown in 1976.</p>
      <p>Although this collection provides little documentation of
         Durant's personal life, it does include one box of personal
         papers relating to Durant's limousine business and to his
         activities as a member of the city government. Some of these
         papers were removed for preservation purposes from a scrapbook
         and are retained in their original order in a folder. They
         include certificates, correspondence, news clippings, and
         photos documenting Durant's activities as a magistrate, notary
         public, and chauffeur. Durant's concern about equal
         opportunities for African-Americans is reflected in news
         clippings about housing discrimination, as well as a letter
         from President Johnson's secretary personally thanking Durant
         for his comments on the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The
         scrapbook materials also include several letters from
         satisfied customers who enjoyed Durant's driving and
         historical commentary.</p>

      <p>The subject matter of this visual archive is
         well-documented in a negative log prepared from the
         identifications found on Durant's original negative envelopes.
         As negatives were re-housed in acid free envelopes,
         information from the original envelopes was transferred to
         this log. Researchers can conduct keyword searches in the
         computerized version of this log to locate specific
         individuals, organizations, places, and events. The log also
         provides dates for some of the images. Although some
         photoprints have been matched up to their corresponding
         negatives, the process of linking prints to negatives is very
         time consuming and is still continuing. Researchers who wish
         to locate the print made from a particular negative must
         examine all of the prints in a particular subject series in
         order to find a match. It is hoped that in time each
         photoprint will have a negative number on its back linking it
         to a specific negative in the negative file.</p>

        </scopecontent>
        <arrangement>
          <p>A group of these photoprints have been arranged in
               sub-series to correspond with the arrangement devised by
               Durant to organize his images. This arrangement was
               derived from notations on the envelopes housing
               negatives. Most of Durant's negatives were filed in
               envelopes having a numeric series designation and a
               subject. Since not all of the series were represented on
               the envelopes received with the photoprints, the
               sub-series below are not always consecutively numbered.
               Instead, they reflect the numeric designation originally
               assigned by Durant to a particular series.</p>

            <p>Consists of black &amp; white and color portraits
                  of male and female African-Americans. Most of the
                  prints are carefully posed portraits, although some
                  of them appear to be candid shots taken of the
                  subject involved in an activity. A group of male
                  portraits within this sub-series has been identified
                  as faculty portraits for the Surry County Training
                  School. Some of the female portraits appear to have
                  been taken for a special occasion, such as a prom,
                  engagement or birthday. A few of the female portraits
                  date from the very early twentieth century, showing
                  African-American women in Edwardian attire.</p>

                  prints of African Amerian night clubs in the

                  Since Durant often traveled to other locations to
                  photograph jazz musicians and singers, this series

                  performers as Count Basie.</p>
