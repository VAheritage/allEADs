         <p>Mary Tyler Freeman Cheek McClenahan is a Richmond community
         leader, activist and philanthropist. She has been described as
         the "conscience of Richmond" for her contributions to the
         Richmond community in the areas of racial harmony, housing,
         Richmond revitalization and historic preservation. She has
         also been active in the arts, her church, and education.</p>
         <p>Born in Richmond on April 6, 1917, Mary Tyler is the
         daughter of Douglas Southall Freeman (1886-1953), noted
         historian and journalist, and Inez Goddin Freeman (1891-1974).
         She attended St. Catherine's School and Vassar College,
         receiving an A.B. in English-Creative Writing in 1937.</p>
         <p>After college she worked briefly as a secretary in the
         Department of Fine Arts of William and Mary College where she
         met Leslie Cheek, Jr. (1908-1992), then head of the
         department. They married in 1939. The Cheeks lived in
         Baltimore for three years while Mr. Cheek was Director of the
         Baltimore Museum of Fine Arts and in Washington, D.C. during
         World War II. While Mr. Cheek served in the Army, Mrs.
         McClenahan volunteered as a nurse's aid. After Cheek's
         discharge from the Army in 1945, they lived in New York City
         where Cheek had been hired as an Associate Editor of
         Architectural Forum Magazine. The couple returned to Richmond
         when Cheek became the first director of the Virginia Museum of
         Fine Arts (1948-1968). The Cheeks had four children. After Mr.
         Cheek's death in 1992, Mrs. Cheek married Dr. John Lorimer
         McClenahan, a retired Pennsylvanian radiologist, the following
         year.</p>
         <p>Mrs. McClenahan is responsible for a number of Richmond
         civic initiatives, including bringing together the 35 groups
         that make up the Richmond Better Housing Coalition and
         founding the Richmond Urban Forum. She was twice president of
         the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood and has
         participated as a volunteer and board member of numerous
         Richmond civic organizations, including Richmond Renaissance
         and Richmond-On- The- James. She has also been an active
         member of Richmond's historic St. Paul's Episcopal Church.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The collection includes correspondence, notes, clippings,
         various organizational minutes, reports and files, drafts of
         speeches, manuscripts and published materials dating from 1933
         through 1993. The bulk of the collection dates from the late
         1970s through the early 1990s and focuses on Mrs. McClenahan's
         involvement on issues of race, housing, historic preservation,
         and Richmond revitalization.</p>
         <p>The organizational records in the collection include
         material from many of Richmond's major civic organizations,
         including Planned Parenthood, the Richmond Better Housing
         Coalition, Richmond-On-The-James, Richmond Renaissance and the
         Richmond Urban Forum. The activities of other organizations
         are also represented to a lesser degree. A number of these
         organizations are represented in other collections within
         Special Collections &amp; Archives. Please ask a staff member
         for more information.</p>
         <p>The collection also contains material documenting Mrs.
         McClenahan's involvement in education, the arts and politics
         in Richmond and Virginia, in St. Paul's Episcopal Church, and
         speeches she has given. Other material in the collection
         ranges from correspondence of friends and family to material
         on her daily life, social plans, family holidays and vacations
         to information on her various interests.</p>
      </scopecontent>
      <arrangement>
         <head>Organization</head>
         <p>The collection is divided into a series of eight sections.
         Series I is primarily correspondence to Mrs. McClenahan.
         Series II consists of material of twelve major civic and
         volunteer organizations with which she was involved. Because
         of the volume of the materials, each organization in this
         series was divided into its own subseries. Series III is
         composed of other organizations in which she was active, but
         of sufficient quantity to justify its own subseries. The
         material in this series is divided alphabetically. Series IV
         is a collection of her speeches and articles. The speeches in
         this series are unidentified by audience or sponsor or
         affiliated with a group not otherwise not listed in another
         series. Additional speeches may be found in organizational
         series by checking folder headings. Series V contains material
         regarding political candidates and issues. Series VI consists
         of material relating to the various schools, colleges and
         universities she has been associated with and is divided
         alphabetical. Series VII contains material relating to her
         work with St. Paul's Episcopal Church. Series VIII consists of
         a variety of material reflecting Mrs. McClenahan's daily
         activities, social plans, and wide range of interests. [See
         the NOTE under Series for additional materials added in
         2000.]</p>
