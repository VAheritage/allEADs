      <p>Richmond author James Branch Cabell (1879-1958) is best
         known for his controversial Jurgen (1919), one of several
         ironic fantasies he wrote that took place in Cabell's mythical
         medieval world of Poictesme (Pwa- tem). Jurgen, laced with
         erotic overtones, was considered pornographic by some and a
         trial over its content brought the reclusive writer national
         fame. Throughout the 1920s, Cabell was highly regarded by his
         literary peers -- H.L. Mencken, Sinclair Lewis, and others
         praised his works. His medieval romanticism and fantasy were
         in fact thinly disguised commentary on the manners of those
         times.</p>
      <p>Cabell was born April 14, 1879 at 101 E. Franklin St., the
         present site of the Richmond Public Library. His father was
         Robert Gamble Cabell, II (1847-1922), a physician; his mother
         Anne Harris (1859-1915), daughter of Col. and Mrs James R.
         Branch. Cabell's great grandfather was William H. Cabell,
         governor of Virginia from 1805-1808. Cabell had two brothers,
         Robert Gamble Cabell, III (1881-1968) and John Lottier Cabell
         (1883-1946). His parents separated and were later divorced in
         1907.</p>
      <p>After attending William and Mary College (1893-1898), where
         he taught courses in French and Greek while an undergraduate,
         Cabell worked briefly at the Richmond Times as a copy-holder.
         Beginning in 1899 he lived for two years in New York City,
         working for the New York Herald as a social reporter, serving
         for a time in the paper's Harlem office. In 1901 he returned
         to Richmond and worked several months on the staff of the
         Richmond News. During the next ten years he performed
         genealogical research and wrote many short stories and
         articles, contributing to national magazines such as Harper's
         Monthly Magazine and the Saturday Evening Post.</p>
      <p>In 1911, he was employed as a bookkeeper in the office of
         his uncle's (James R. Branch) coal mine in West Virginia. He
         returned to Richmond in 1913 and married Rebecca Priscilla
         Bradley Shepherd (1874-1949), a widow with five children by
         her previous marriage. They had one son, Ballard Hartwell
         Cabell (1915-1980).</p>
      <p>Although he had written for newspapers, Cabell's first work
         to be published in a journal was a college paper entitled The
         Comedies of William Congreve which appeared in the April 1901
         edition of International. His first book, The Eagle's Shadow,
         was published in the autumn of 1904 after it appeared serially
         in the Saturday Evening Post during that summer. Whether it
         was his highly mannered prose or the fact that he was writing
         ironic romances, his work was slow to draw critical attention.
         By 1918 he had published 10 major works and began to attract
         critical admirers. In an article published that year in the
         New York Evening Mail, H.L. Mencken described Cabell as "the
         only first-rate literary craftsman that the whole South can
         show." Cabell's stature and fame as an author grew immensely
         with the 1919 publication of Jurgen.</p>
      <p>On January 14, 1920, the New York State Society for the
         Prevention of Vice charged Cabell's publishing editor, Guy
         Holt, with violation of the anti-obscenity provisions of the
         New York State Penal Code by publishing Jurgen. The
         controversy over the charges and the attempt at censorship
         brought the shy Cabell much notoriety. Writers defended the
         artistry of Jurgen and Cabell's right to publish it. College
         students and others read it because it had been banned.</p>
      <p>The obscenity trial over Jurgen began October 16, 1922, and
         ended three days later with an acquittal of all charges. Judge
         Charles C. Nott, the presiding judge, wrote in his decision
         that "...the most that can be said against the book is that
         certain passages therein may be considered suggestive in a
         veiled and subtle way of immorality, but such suggestions are
         delicately conveyed" and that because of Cabell's writing
         style "...it is doubtful if the book could be read or
         understood at all by more than a very limited number of
         readers."</p>
      <p>Throughout the 1920s, he continued to publish in the style
         of Jurgen, a combination of satire, symbolism and fantasy, set
         in a mythical medieval French provence, called Poictesme
         (Pwa-tam). The name was a compound of two provinces located in
         the south of France, Poitiers and Angouleme. In these books,
         Cabell blended an assortment of myths and legends laced with
         puns, anagrams, and allegories. These works eventually became
         part of an eighteen-volume collection entitled The Biography
         of the Life of Manuel. The last volume was published in
         1930.</p>
      <p>Cabell had become well regarded by prominent writers of the
         period and maintained an extensive correspondence with a wide
         circle of literary artists and friends, including Mencken,
         Joseph Hergesheimer, Burton Rascoe, Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair
         Lewis, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Carl Van Vechten, and fellow
         Richmonder and close friend Ellen Glasgow. He had known
         Glasgow since his days at William and Mary College. He also
         served as editor of the Virginia War History Commission
         (1919-1926) and later joined Dreiser, Eugene O'Neil and others
         on the editorial board of the American Spectator (1932-1935).
         In 1937, Cabell was elected to the American Academy of Arts
         and Sciences.</p>
      <p>While the controversy over Jurgen insured Cabell an
         audience throughout most of the 1920s, interest in his books
         dropped sharply in the New Deal era of the 1930s and continued
         to decline. His work was considered outdated, his writing too
         stylized.</p>
      <p>In 1932, in an attempt to break away from his past, he
         began to publish work under the name Branch Cabell. During the
         next three decades he wrote and published nearly twenty more
         books. They were grouped in a series of trilogies. He returned
         as James Branch Cabell in 1947 with the publication of Let Me
         Lie. It was the first installment of his fifth and last
         trilogy, consisting largely of semi-autobiographical essays,
         filled with remembrances of Virginia.</p>
      <p>Cabell continued to live and work in Richmond, residing at
         3201 Monument Avenue. He and his family began to spend most of
         their winter months in St. Augustine, Florida after Cabell
         began to suffer from attacks of pneumonia in 1935. During
         their stay in Florida in 1949, his wife died of heart failure.
         In 1950, he married Margaret Waller Freeman (1893?-1983), whom
         he had known for many years. Cabell suffered a cerebral
         hemorrhage in 1958 and on May 5, he died at his home in
         Richmond.</p>
      <p>Cabell's writings, published in various magazines,
         newspapers and anthologies, included numerous short stories,
         poetry, essays, book reviews and one play. He had authored
         more than 52 volumes of work, including three devoted to
         genealogy.</p>
      <p>Cabell is recognized as one of the first contemporary
         writers from the South. Like his friend and fellow Richmond
         writer Ellen Glasgow (1873-1945), Cabell was not afraid to
         satirize what he saw as the South's contradictions. Others,
         noting Cabell's unique blending of classic myths and legends
         with his own imagination, consider him a pioneer of fantasy
         writing. His work has been admired by a diverse group of
         writers, including Carl Van Vechten, Margaret Mitchell, Edmund
         Wilson, Robert Heinlein, and Neil Gaiman.</p>
      <p>Soon after Virginia Commonwealth University was established
         in 1968, when the Medical College of Virginia merged with
         Richmond Professional Institute, the University began plans
         for a new library for the Academic Campus. In 1970, the James
         Branch Cabell Library, named for one of Richmond's most
         respected writers, opened its doors.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent>
      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection is composed of a great deal of material that
         had been placed by Cabell in books that made up his personal
         library which numbered about 3,000 volumes and was donated to
         the library in the 1970s.</p>
      <p>The collection includes correspondence with a number of
         noted American and British writers of the 20th century
         including H.L. Mencken, Ellen Glasgow, Sinclair Lewis, and
         Theodore Dreiser. There is also correspondence with family,
         friends, editors and publishers.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains manuscripts of Cabell's work
         dating primarily from 1900 through 1930. Published reviews and
         criticisms of Cabell's work by various editors and writers is
         also included. The papers also contain a large collection of
         periodicals where Cabell's essays, reviews and fiction were
         published. Published and unpublished dramatic and musical
         interpretations of Cabell's work by others is included in the
         collection. Newspaper clippings, photographs, periodicals,
         criticisms, printed material, and publishers' agreements and
         statements of sales are also found in the collection. The
         collection also contains notebooks and scrapbooks compiled by
         Cabell documenting his early years as a writer.</p>
      <p>The papers dating from 1963-1971 of the Cabell Society and
         correspondence between its founders is included in the
         collection as well as materials concerning Between Friends:
         Letters of James Branch Cabell and Others which was published
         in 1962.</p>
      <p>Much of the material in Series I, II, III and VIII was
         taken from the nearly 3,000 volumes in Cabell's personal
         library. Cabell placed letters, newspaper clippings,
         photographs, illustrations, typed and written revisions of his
         works and other memorabilia in his books. In 1967, Cabell's
         library was cataloged by then doctoral student Jean Maurice
         Duke. He assigned each volume a "Duke" number and gave a
         description of each book and its contents. Prof. Duke would
         later serve as a long time faculty member of VCU's English
         Department.</p>
      <p>In the 1970s his library (some 3,000 volumes) was moved
         from his home on Monument Avenue to VCU's James Branch Cabell
         Library. A sizable portion of that material was laminated at
         the Barrow lab at the Virginia State Library, paid for by
         Margaret Freeman Cabell.</p>
      <p>Items taken from Cabell's library will have a Duke number
         written in pencil on it, indicating what volume the material
         was taken from. See James Branch Cabell's Library: A Catalogue
         by Jean Maurice Duke to determine from which book the item
         came.</p>

               where many of Cabell's book reviews, essays, short
               stories and other fiction originally appeared before
               they were later revised into book form. Each volume is
               named for a published Cabell book and contains the
               original magazine contribution. There are also two boxes

                  Athens, Greece or in South America and a 1906 letter
                  from the White House regretting Cabell's decision not
                  to accept the position in the State Department. There
                  are also programs of plays performed in 1896 by the

            <p>This is a bound volume of 112 sheets (8 1/2 x 10
                  1/2) containing a large amount of many kinds of
                  material concerning Cabell and his writings.</p>
            <p>There are almost 100 letters to him. Many are from
                  publishers to whom he had sent, or offered to send, a
                  manuscript. In some of these the publishers offered
                  to read his book. In others they gave their opinions
                  of it and their decision on publishing. Most of these
                  say that while they appreciated the quality of his
                  work they cannot publish it, usually because they do
                  not think it would be profitable. There are a few
                  letters asking him to submit material to them. Many
                  others are from individuals who have read something
                  by or about him. Most of this material is dated from
                  1911-1917.</p>
            <p>There are also more than 100 newspaper and
                  magazine clippings about him, his family and his
                  books. Some are advertisements, some are reviews.
                  They come from all over the country and nearly all
                  are dated and have the name of the source. It appears
                  that a clipping service must have supplied many of
                  them. There are also a few photographs of Cabell.</p>
