      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Lucian Louis Watts (1888-19) was born in Albemarle County,
         Virginia in November 1888. Son of the Albemarle County
         Sheriff, he graduated from public high school and attended
         Fork Union Military Academy for one year. His youth was an
         active one, and he participated in local sports and served as
         a deputy sheriff.</p>
      <p>Watts was employed at railroad construction work at age
         eighteen. Within the next three years he became Superintendent
         of seven miles of railroad construction work. He continued in
         this profession until a dynamite explosion caused him to lose
         his sight, May 27, 1913.</p>
      <p>Following a recuperation of more than a year, Watts
         enrolled in the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind in
         Staunton, October 1914. He graduated from the school in June
         1917, and he returned there the following fall to be a
         supervisor of blind boys. By June 1918, he had became an
         instructor of industrial work. At the same time he made plans
         to organize an association for the adult blind. With the help
         of H. Randolph Latimer of Maryland, and of H.M. McManaway,
         Superintendent of the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind,
         Watts organized the Virginia Association of Workers for the
         Blind, June 9, 1919.</p>
      <p>The legislative survey led to the creation of a
         three-member Commission to study these problems in depth; Watt
         served as secretary of this temporary commission. The
         commission was enlarged and made permanent in 1922, and Watt
         was appointed its Executive Secretary. He was also elected as
         the first president of the Virginia Association of Workers for
         the Blind, a position he held continuously throughout his
         affiliation with the Association.</p>
      <p>Watts, through the Association of Workers for the Blind,
         initiated a financial campaign to establish a workshop for the
         blind at Charlottesville. Begun in 1925, the Workshop for the
         Blind was completed by 1930. It was transferred to the
         Virginia Commission for the Blind in 1936.</p>
      <p>Watts served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates
         from January 1, 1926 to January 1, 1934. In 1934 he was
         elected President of the American Association of Workers for
         the Blind, and after his term ended in 1936 he remained active
         in the Association, serving on the Board of Directors and as
         Chairman of the Legislative Committee. He was also a Board
         member for the National Industries of the Blind. Lucian Watts
         died....</p>
