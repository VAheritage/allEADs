      <p>"The legal battles fought over the 1970 Richmond annexation
         are considered by many observers, including attorneys in the
         U.S. Justice Department, as the most complex, prolonged, and
         far-reaching if any legal action triggered by municipal
         boundary expansion. For the Richmond power structure, the Holt
         suits quickly became much more than minor irritants. They had
         the potential to radically change the city's political
         landscape. What in past years involved fairly simple and
         straightforward strategies designed to maintain the political
         status quo now required, given the sophisticated legal
         challenges that Curtis Holt mounted against the city, equally
         sophisticated legal responses. The long cycle of
         action-response-reaction that characterized the sequence of
         events in the he courts was emotionally draining on both the
         participants and the observers. The information generated by
         the tedious research undertaken by attorneys for each side of
         the suits and by consultants versed in urban and regional
         planning, economics, and public administration, plus the
         lengthy depositions and courtroom hearings was comparable to
         that of a small library. The legal battle was made more
         complicated by the intricate routes traveled by the litigants
         and the fact that the routes at different points crossed each
         other, ran parallel to each other, and diverged at right
         angles. Journalists covering the cases over the years were
         hard pressed to summarize the proceedings in an intelligible
         fashion, as each year one case became more complicated or else
         was set aside as another equally complex case, was begun.</p>
      <p>"The litigation began in February 1971 was Curtis Holt
         initiated his first suit contesting the annexation on
         constitutional grounds, and concluded over five and a half
         years later in November 1976 following a second Holt suit and
         a suit brought by the city. Litigation over annexation led to
         a U.S. Supreme Court order suspending local elections in
         Richmond that lasted five years and enabled the 1970 council,
         which was to serve until 1972, to continue in power for almost
         seven years. The arguments surrounding the various suits were
         presented to six different judicial bodies, the U.S. District
         Court in Richmond, a three judge district court in Richmond, a
         three judge district court in Washington, D.C., a Special
         Master in Washington, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and
         the U.S. Supreme Court...Holt's first suit (Holt I) against
         the city was successfully argued before the U.S. District
         Court in Richmond. The city, however, was successful in
         overturning the decision in the Fourth Circuit Court of
         Appeals. Holt's response was an appeal to the U.S. Supreme
         Court, but the high court denied the writ.</p>
      <p>"Prior to the termination of the first suit, Holt brought a
         second suit (Holt II) against the city. Holt II was stayed by
         the federal court, though not before the Supreme Court had
         enjoined further city council elections. What prevented Holt
         II from moving forward was a suit which the city filed.</p>
      <p>"The city's suit was itself complex, notwithstanding the
         confusion which was generated by the combination of the city's
         suit, Holt I, and Holt II. The city's suit was brought before
         a special three judge District Court in Washington which
         referred it to a Special Master for hearings and
         recommendations. Upon receiving the recommendation of the
         Master, the Washington court ruled against the city. The city
         appealed to the Supreme Court where, by Unanimous vote, the
         justices held that there was racial motive for the annexation.
         The Court also ruled, however, that, given the single-member
         council districts (Richmond had developed such a plan) and
         justifiable reasons such as economic or administrative
         benefits reaped by the city from the annexed area, the city
         could retain the annexed area. But, the city had to prove that
         such justifiable reasons existed and, moreover, had to revert
         to ward representation.</p>
      <p>"The Supreme Court returned the case to the Washington
         District Court to determine whether verifiable reasons did
         exist. The Washington Court, once again, referred the case to
         the Special Master. The Master found that the city could prove
         that it received economic and administrative benefits from the
         annexed area and recommended, therefore, that the city retain
         the area. The Washington Court agreed with the recommendation
         of the Master and affirmed the annexation.</p>
      <p>"After conferring with members of the city's black
         community and deciding that appeals and other legal action
         were only delaying the reinstatement of councilmanic
         elections, Holt did not appeal the decision to the Supreme
         Court...With the City's suit resolved, the injunction against
         elections were lifted and local elections were called for
         March 1, 1977. Furthermore, Holt II, which was stayed pending
         the outcome of the city's suit, was withdrawn by the Richmond
         District Court upon the request of both the city and Curtis
         Holt." excerpted from

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The materials cover the period 1942 to 1976 with the
         majority of the collection focusing on the period 1969-1975.
         Primarily notes, briefs, motion, replies and questions, the
         documents reflect the scope of the annexation trials of the
         1970s of the City of Richmond. A large portion of the
         materials are not dated and others, because of the
         interdependency of the multiple trials described above, are as
         easily placed in one series as another. Documentation that may
         be of interest aside from the trial proceedings include;
         Comparative Population studies, Master Plans, Financial
         Reports for the City of Richmond, School Board Budgets and
         Reports, and city budgets.</p>

        <p>The collection has been weeded and arranged as closely
            as possible to reflect the separate legal actions involved
            in the Annexation of Chesterfield County and subsequent
            legal actions. Since the processing has occurred over time
            many of the folder heading do not accurately reflect the
            contents of the folders. The guide headings and folder
            numbers correspond to the actual folder numbers and
            contents. Although mistakes in arrangement have probably
            been made (there are some marked Holt III and IV for which
            there is no description) considerable effort has been
            expended to make the materials understandable.</p>
