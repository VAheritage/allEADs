      <p>The Richmond Crusade for Voters was founded in 1956, and
         grew out of The Council to Save Public Schools, a Richmond
         organization formed to fight a January 1956 law which allowed
         cities in Virginia the option of closing public schools rather
         than integrating them. The three co-founders of the Crusade
         were Dr. William S. Thornton, Dr. William Ferguson Reid, and
         John M. Brooks. These three men founded the Richmond Crusade
         for Voters with the goal of "increasing effective black
         participation in Richmond's political process" (Nov-Dec 1988
         edition of Richmond Surroundings). The Crusade's mission is
         "...to increase the voting strength of the population of the
         city of Richmond and to improve the moral, social, economic,
         educational and general welfare of our people" ("Richmond Free
         Press," January 1, 1994).</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection includes photocopied items collected by
         Crusade historian William A. Thornton (no relation to founder
         and first president, Dr. William S. Thornton). Photocopies of
         minutes, correspondence, historian's reports, newsletters,
         newspaper clippings (dating from the 1950s until 1995),
         campaign flyers for various candidates, financial reports and
         other materials make up the collection. Some original
         correspondence, miscellaneous documents, and two photographs
         are also included in the collection. The date range of the
         collection, from the early 1950s until 1995, spans the history
         of the organization.</p>

        <p>There are two binders and a folder in this collection. A
            video, on the history of the Crusade from the television
            news program "Impact," originally accompanied the
            collection. It has been separated from the collection to be
            catalogued. The binders are arranged in chronological order
            and they are separated by the terms of each Crusade
            president. Binder 1 covers the terms between 1953-1984 and
            binder 2 covers 1984- 1995. The folder holds originals of
            articles, correspondence, programs and other materials, all
            of which were photocopied and included in the binders.</p>

               the presidential term and usually a biography of the
               president. There are also newsletters, financial
