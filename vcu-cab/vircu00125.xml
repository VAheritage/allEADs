      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>Carl Archacki, born January 1957 in Meadville, Pennsylvania, was raised in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, and is the youngest and only son (with three older sisters) of Carl Frank Archacki and Helen Mamrak Archacki.  As an infant, Archacki was baptized into the Catholic Church and has remained devout since.  Archacki has served various outreach roles in his younger years, specifically with the Catholic Youth Association (CYA) in the Erie Diocese.  In his outreach efforts, Archacki learned from his parents' model, as they were both "incredible examples in their communities and church throughout their lives."
</p>
      <p>In May 1979, Archacki graduated from Ashland University, Ashland, Ohio, with a Bachelor of Arts in Communication and directly entered the broadcast sales arena with the CBS affiliate, WSEE in Erie, Pennsylvania.   In 1986, Archacki moved to Richmond, Virginia, to begin a sales career with then WXEX, which became WRIC (Richmond's local ABC affiliate) in 1990.  Archacki has been with WRIC for more than twenty years and is currently the Regional Sales Manager.  While in Richmond, Archacki became involved with Dignity / Integrity, a religious support group for gay / lesbian Catholics and Episcopalians, and would serve as both Vice-President and President of the local Richmond chapter.
</p>
      <p>In the 1990s, Archacki became involved with the Sexual Minorities Commission of the Catholic Diocese of Richmond.  The commission, an official Catholic outreach support group that ministered to the spiritual and pastoral needs of gay / lesbian Christians and their families, operated for twenty-five years under the support of Bishop Walter Sullivan.  It was dissolved in 2004 by the Richmond Diocese.  Archacki served as chair of the commission for six years and helped organize and carry out many retreats and workshops throughout the Richmond Diocese.  He also helped establish the National Association of Catholic Diocesan Lesbian and Gay Ministries and served on its national board.
</p>
      <p>For more than twenty years, Archacki has been an active parishioner of the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart, where he has been involved with various ministries, including: the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA), Social Ministry Program, Pastoral Council, Communications Committee, and Communion Minister.  Archacki's role in activism outreach activities has also spread into the secular environment and has included work with Equality Virginia, the Human Rights Campaign, the Richmond Ad Club, the Richmond Aids Business Council, the Richmond City Democratic Party, and the Richmond Gay Pride Coalition.
