      <p>Clarence Lee Townes, Jr., businessman, political activist,
         and a significant participant in the revitalization of
         Richmond, Virginia, has spent much of his life working to
         broaden and increase economic and political opportunities for
         African-Americans in Virginia.</p>
      <p>Born in Richmond on January 21, 1928, Townes is the son of
         Alice Smith and Clarence L. Townes, Sr. and graduated from
         Armstrong High School in 1944. Townes attended Virginia Union
         University and received a B.S. degree (Commerce). In 1951, he
         married Grace Elizabeth Harris of Richmond and the couple had
         four children. Commissioned in 1952 as a Second Lietenant in
         the United States Army Infantry, Townes received an honorabel
         discharge in 1953.</p>
      <p>After the army, Townes was appointed Assistant Manager
         (Richmond Office) of the Virginia Mutual Benefit Life
         Insurance Company, a company his father had helped found. He
         later became director of training (1964- 1966).</p>
      <p>Townes was active in Republican Party politics in the late
         1950s. As many African-Americans were turning towards the
         Democratic Party, he served on the Richmond City Republican
         Committee (1958-1961) and as a board member of Richmond
         Forward, a political action group. Also, her served as
         commissioner (1963-1966) of the Richmond Redevelopment and
         Housing Authority. Townes attended the 1964 Republican
         convention as the first black member of a Virginia delegation
         in modern times. After the convention, he ran as the
         Republican Candidate for the Richmond-Henrico seat in the
         Virginia House of Delegates. Although he lost, and would not
         seek public office in the future, the election race brought
         national attention to the South and its treatment of
         African-Americans in the political process. "The great thing
         that came out of this (election), "Townes wrote at the time,
         "was to focus the attention of both parties on legitimately
         seeking the Negro vote (in Virginia)."</p>
      <p>Townes was Special Assistant to the State Chairman,
         Republican Party of Virginia in 1965 (1965-1966). He organized
         and was treasurer of the National Negro Republican Assembley
         (1965-1966) which ran an eight man Republican slate against an
         eight man Democratic slate. In 1966, Townes became an
         Assistant to the Chairman of the Republican National Committee
         (1966-1970) and later Director of Minorities (1967-1970),
         working to increase Republican ties with minorities.</p>
      <p>In 1970, after leaving the RNC, he helped found the Joint
         Center for Political Affairs, an African-American think-tank
         associated with Howard University. The Joint Center was
         created to help newly elected black officials with the
         business of government. Townes sereved as Director of
         Governmental Affairs (1970-1974).</p>
      <p>In addition, Townes was a board and founding member of the
         Jefferson Townhouse Corporation of Richmond, Virginia, a black
         controlled enterprise that operated a housing complex located
         in the city. In 1970 he became a member of the Board of
         Directors of the Consolidated Bank and Trust Co. of Richmond,
         the oldest black controlled bank in the nation. Townes also
         worked as a consultant on federal programs to Virginia State
         College and was a consultant to the Virginia Electric and
         Power company on matters pertaining to equal employment. He
         was also a consultant for the Manpower Administration, U.S.
         Department of Labor, evaluating the agency's National Office
         Equal Opportunity Program.</p>
      <p>After commuting by bus from Richmond to Washington, D.C.
         for eight years, Townes returned to Richmond in 1974 to
         establish a bus company called Metro Coach. After a series of
         business disappointments, lawsuits and investigations the
         company eventually turned into a success. At this time, the
         early 1980s, Townes chaired Richmond Renaissance, a
         non-profit, biracial corporation formed to foster economic
         development in downtown Richmond. Townes served as Richmond
         Renaissance's deputy director from 1982 until 1991 when he
         appointed director.</p>
      <p>In the early 1990s he served as head of the Richmond School 
	   Board and the Metropolitan Richmond Convention and Visitors 
	   Bureau. He was a member of the VCU Board of Visitors in the 
	   late 1990s. In the 2000s he served as a consultant and member 
	   to several boards and campaigns, including as a member of the 
	   VCU Real Estate Foundation and a Board of Trustees emeritus at 
	   the Valentine Museum.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection includes correspondence, notes, newspaper
         and journal clippings, various organizational minutes,
         numerous reports and files, drafts of speeches, manuscripts
         and published materials dating from 1944 through 1988. The
         bulk of the collection dates from the early 1960s through the
         mid 1980s and focuses on Townes' interest in and involvement
         with issues concerning race, politics, and the revitalization
         of downtown Richmond. The collection also includes a
         significant amount of material on the role of African-American
         Republicans in the Virginia Republican Party of the 1960s and
         in the National Republican Party during the late 1960s and
         early 1970s.</p>
      <p>Related information on the revitalization and development
         of downtown Richmond can be found in the Richmond Renaissance
         Archives (M 303) and the McClenahan (M 302).</p>
      <p>Series I contains materials documenting Townes' numerous
         entrepreneurial and civic activities, mostly dating from the
         late 1950s until the early 1960s. Miscellaneous material,
         which were not appropriate for other major sections of the
         collection, are also located within this series.</p>
      <p>Series II contains the largest quantity of material and
         concerns the Virginia Republican Party (1963-1966) and the
         Republican National Committee (1966-1972). Correspondence,
         reports and publications, material from Townes' race for the
         Virginia General Assembly and his work with the National Negro
         Republican Assembly (1964-1966) are included in this series,
         in addition to miscellaneous Republican items.</p>
      <p>Series III consists of records from Townes' work with the
         Joint Center for Political Studies, dating from the early
         1970s.</p>
      <p>Series IV is composed of materials generated by Townes as
         deputy director in the early years of the Richmond
         Renaissance. These records focus on projects, particularly
         Sixth Street Marketplace and the Richmond Metro Visitors
         Center.</p>
      <p>Series V contains an abundant collection of publications
         and reports collected by Townes, many on urban and minority
         issues. The majority of the publications were distributed by
         the Republican Party (late 1960s-early 1970s). There are also
         U.S. government publications, publications from the Joint
         Center for Political Studies, and miscellaneous publications
         pertaining to business, education, localities, civic
         organizations and public policy organizations.</p>
      <p>Series VI is comprised of ephemeral material, primarily
         related to the Republican Party, as well as tapes of speeches,
         business cards, address books and business calendars. This
         series also contains nearly forty photographs of Townes
         and others. Most of the
         photographs were taken for publicity, dating from his campaign
         for the General Assembly in 1965 through his days at the
         Republican National Committee in the late 1960s and early
         1970s.</p>
