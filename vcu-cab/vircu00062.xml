         <p>George Cruikshank, son of caricaturist Isaac Cruikshank,
         was born in London, England in 1792 and died there in 1878. He
         began his career as a social/political caricaturist in 1811.
         Between 1819 and 1821, Cruikshank produced a series of colored
         etchings followed by a collection of comic stories in four
         volumes. He was considered the foremost illustrator of such
         classics as Grimms' Fairy Tales, Scott's novels and Dicken's
         Oliver Twist. In 66 years of work, Cruikshank illustrated more
         than 200 books. His work, wrote one reviewer of a biography of
         Cruikshank, "recorded, commented on, and satirized his times
         to such an extent that they have frequently been used to
         represent the age."</p>
      </bioghist>
      <scopecontent>
         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The collection is comprised of eight sketches and notes by
         Cruikshank dated 1833, 1845, 1852, 1874, and undated. The
         collection also contains seven autographed letters to
         Cruikshank, and one un-mailed mourning envelope addressed in
         Cruikshank's hand, with his signature for return address. The
         letters total 13 pages are on matters of business,
         arrangements for printing his drawings, passes to exhibits of
         his works, and the like, 1860-1872.</p>
         <p>Special Collections and Archives also has a significant
         collection of books illustrated by George Cruikshank -- many
         of which were published in the 19th century.</p>
