      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Fred Orr Wygal (1900-1980), a leader in the field of
         education in Virginia, was a native of Dryden in Lee County,
         Virginia. He received his A.B. degree from Emory and Henry
         College in 1926 and his M.A. degree from the University of
         Virginia in 1930. He was named Outstanding Alumnus of the Year
         by Emory and Henry College in 1967, and he was awarded an
         honorary Doctor of Humanities degree by that institution in
         1974.</p>
      <p>Wygal began his educational career as a classroom teacher
         in Lee County in the mid-1920s, and served as principals of
         three high schools in Washington and Grayson counties between
         1927 and 1939. In 1939, he was named superintendent of the
         Radford public schools, where he served until 1942, when he
         was appointed Director of the Division of Guidance and Adult
         Education for the Virginia Department of Education. He was
         named Director of the Division of Related Instructional
         Services in 1954, and in 1958 he became Director of the
         Division of Teacher Education.</p>
      <p>During his years of service with the Department of
         Education, he took a leave of absence to become acting chief
         executive of Longwood College during the absence of Francis L.
         Lankford in 1962-1963. He retired from the State Department of
         Education in 1964, and became Dean of Students at Ferrum
         College. He served in this position until 1966, and he again
         served as acting president of Longwood College from 1967 until
         1968. In 1968, he was appointed as acting executive
         administrator of Virginia Commonwealth University when that
         University was created by the merger of the medical College of
         Virginia and Richmond Professional Institute in 1968. He held
         that post until 1969. In 1968, he was named director of the
         Virginia Board of Vocational Rehabilitation's study for a
         proposed long-range plan for vocational rehabilitation. He
         returned to Ferrum College in 1970.</p>
      <p>In addition to his contributions in the educational field,
         Wygal was a long-time member of Reveille Methodist Church in
         Richmond, where he taught Young Adult Bible Class for thirty
         years, and served three terms as Chairman of the
         Administrative Board. He was also a former president of Rotary
         International and a former director of the Southern Council of
         Teacher Education. He was a member of the United Methodist
         Conference Board of Education, a member of the Richmond
         Community Council and he was chairman of the Richmond District
         Committee on Adult Education.</p>
      <p>Wygal was honored by three Virginia colleges for his
         associations with them. The faculty center at Ferrum College,
         the music building at Longwood College, and the school
         administration building at Radford University are all named
         for him.</p>
      <p>Wygal was married to Billie Robinson and had one son, Fred
         O. Wygal, Jr.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Wygal Papers contain primarily materials related to
         education in Virginia, particularly higher education, and to
         activities of the Methodist church. Included in the collection
         are numerous reports of self- studies conducted by elementary
         schools in Virginia in which Wygal participated, as well as an
         investigative study of Radford University. In addition, the
         collection contains a report and materials related to a
         self-study conducted by Reveille Methodist Church in which
         Wygal took an active part.</p>
      <p>Wygal's correspondence, both personal and official,
         provides a clear sense of his commitment to and involvement in
         the quality of education in Virginia, and much of the material
         included in the collection is related to his experience in the
         administration of higher education. Wygal was much in demand
         as a speaker, both in his capacity as an educator and as an
         informed layman in his church, and the collection contains
         over 200 public speaking items, including outlines, notes and
         texts of speeches and lectures.</p>
      <p>Wygal's relationship with the Methodist Church in Virginia
         was a long and active one, and his influence was felt in many
         areas of his church's life. The collection contains minutes
         and related materials of the Administrative Board of Reveille
         Methodist Church in Richmond, as well as reports and studies
         of the Wesley Foundation campus ministry at several Virginia
         schools. Wygal was involved in the Commission for Christian
         Higher Education, and his papers contain materials related to
         this activity.</p>
