            Executive Director Clarence L. Townes, Jr. was made October
            11, 1996, consisting of approximately 33 linear feet. A
            second donation from Richmond Renaissance Inc. occurred two
            years later, October 10, 1996, when the organization merged
            that month with the Central Richmond Association and
            Downtown Richmond Inc. This second donation consisted of
            120 linear feet (many of which were oversize items,

      <p>Richmond Renaissance Inc. is a non-profit, bi-racial,
         public-private corporation formed in 1981 to foster economic
         development in downtown Richmond. Its first major project was
         the 6th Street Marketplace, which opened in 1985.
         Revitalization of Richmond's historic Jackson Ward
         neighborhood and improvements to the city's downtown
         riverfront property were two other major initiatives in which
         Richmond Renaissance has played an active role. Richmond
         Renaissance has been involved with other projects, including
         the Jackson Center office building, the Belle Isle pedestrian
         bridge and Canal Walk, increased downtown parking, the
         Cultural Link Trolley Project, the Broad Street Task Force and
         numerous other efforts to foster economic development</p>
      <p>The role and direction of Richmond Renaissance is overseen
         by its officers, many of whom are city officials, and a large
         board of directors (64 members in 1997). The board is
         comprised of prominent citizens, members of the business
         community, and various other city representatives. The
         Executive Committee manages the organization and includes
         members of the board, officers, and members of the Executive
         Staff. It is the Executive Staff which manages the day to day
         activities. The first Executive Director was J. Randall Evans,
         who served from October 1982 until December 1986. Clarence L.
         Townes, Jr. was the Deputy Director during that time. Townes
         then served as acting director from December 1986 to August
         1987 when Robert E. Olson was named Executive Director. Townes
         continued as Deputy Director. In November 1991 Olson left to
         become Executive Director of the Virginia Biotechnology
         Research Park and Mr. Townes was named Executive Director.</p>
      <p>In the fall of 1996, Richmond Renaissance Inc. merged with
         two other city organizations that had been promoting economic
         development in Richmond, the Central Richmond Association
         (CRA), begun in the early 1950s, and Downtown Richmond Inc.
         The merger was described as an attempt to unify "fund-raising
         efforts and to more effectively address Downtown issues."
         Townes continues in his position as Executive Director after
         the merger. Frances N. Johns, former director of CRA, was
         appointed Assistant Executive Director of Richmond
         Renaissance.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Richmond Renaissance Archives include correspondence,
         minutes, newspaper and journal clippings, various
         publications, reports, photographs, slides, and various
         promotional materials dating from 1956 through 1995. The bulk
         of the collection dates from 1982 through 1994 and focuses on
         Richmond Renaissance's activities to foster downtown Richmond
         revitalization. The collection documents the organization's
         involvement with a number of initiatives in the city,
         including the development of the city's riverfront properties,
         redevelopment of the downtown area, including Broad Street,
         and Jackson Ward neighborhood, and its planning, promotion and
         leadership in the development of the Sixth Street
         Marketplace.</p>

        <head>Arrangement</head>
        <p>The first deposit of the collection, consisting of about
            one third of the materials, was deposited to Special
            Collections and Archives (SCA) in transfile boxes labeled
            by subject (i.e. Jackson Ward, Sixth Street Marketplace).
            The collection was arranged to reflect this subject
            division, arranged topically by series and alphabetically
            therein. The second deposit of the collection has not been
            fully processed although it is inventoried and is
            accessible to researchers. Materials in this section of the
            archives will eventually be transferred to the appropriate
            collection series. Most of the original office folder
            headings have been maintained in the processing of this
            collection.</p>
      </arrangement>
      <arrangement>
        <head>Organization</head>
        <p>The collection is divided into seven series. Series
            I--Jackson Ward (n.d., 1964-1992) consists of materials
            relating to the redevelopment of Jackson Ward, a historic
            African-American Richmond neighborhood. This series also
            contains information on Broad Street, the Church Hill
            neighborhood, and other downtown revitalization
            initiatives. Series II--Riverfront (n.d., 1983-1991) is
            composed of material on various projects associated with
            the city's Riverfront area, including the Canal Walk, Belle
            Isle, and the James River Discovery Program. Series
            III--Sixth Street Marketplace (n.d., 1956-1986) documents
            the early years of the Sixth Street Marketplace project,
            from its planning stages to the first few years of its
            existence. Series IV--General Office Files and
            Correspondence (n.d., 1982-1989) contains the
            organization's general office file and correspondence. This
            series also contains material relating to projects other
            than those in the first three sections of the
            collection.</p>
        <p>Series V--Miscellaneous Reports and Publications (n.d.,
            1980-1990) includes publications produced by the city, the
            state, the federal government, numerous organizations and
            publishers -- all relating to urban and regional planning.
            Series VI--Photographs, Slides, Video and Audio Tapes
            (n.d., 1984-1991) contains photographs, slides, and other
            media documenting many of the organization's endeavors --
            including about three dozen large poster size placards used
            for presentations on Broad Street buildings and other
            redevelopment projects. The last series in the collection,
            Series VII, is made up of the second deposit of materials
            made by Richmond Renaissance, Inc. and includes materials
            found in the previous six sections of the collection. These
            materials date in range from 1969-1995 and will be placed
            in the appropriate sections of the collection in the
            future.</p>
