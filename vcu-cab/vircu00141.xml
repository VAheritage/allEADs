<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Virginia's capital had its own symphony orchestra for a brief period in the 1930's; but the present Richmond Symphony dates from 1956, when it was founded as a community orchestra.  Edgar Schenkman led the orchestra as its music director and conductor from its founding until 1971, when direction was taken over by French conductor Jacques Houtmann.  The Symphony expanded greatly during Houtmann's sixteen years of leadership, achieving regional orchestra status and turning its part time "Little Symphony" into a full time Sinfonia in 1973.  The first such professional symphonic ensemble to be established in Virginia, the Richmond Sinfonia proceeded to expand its schedule, particularly in the area of in school concerts for Virginia's school children.  Further performing flexibility was lent by the Symphony's String, Brass, and Woodwind Ensembles.  The development of student concerts and the sponsorship of youth orchestras rounded out the Symphony's extensive involvement with music education in the state.
</p>
<p>In 1987 the orchestra welcomed its third director, the young George Manahan from the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra.  The Richmond Symphony continues to be the largest performing arts organization in Virginia.  Concert series, both classical and popular, are held in the Richmond Mosque and the Virginia Center for the Performing Arts (Carpenter Center), a downtown theater in whose renovation the Symphony took part.  These and other special performances are supported by foundations, private donations, and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Virginia Commission for the Arts.
