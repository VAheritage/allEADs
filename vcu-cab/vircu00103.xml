      <p>"M. Thomas Inge, Ph.D. is the Robert Emory Blackwell
         Professor of English and the Humanities at Randolph-Macon
         College in Ashland, Virginia. A native of Newport News,
         Virginia, he received his B.A. degree in English and Spanish
         from Randolph-Macon College in 1959 and his M.A. and Ph.D.
         degrees in English and American literature from Vanderbilt
         University in 1960 and 1964 respectively. After teaching at
         Vanderbilt University, he became a member of the Department of
         American Thought and Language at Michigan State University
         from 1964 to 1969, when he joined the Department of English at
         Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. He served as
         Chair of the department from 1974 to 1980 and then was Head of
         the Department of English at Clemson University in South
         Carolina. From 1982 to 1984, he was appointed Resident Scholar
         in American Studies by the U.S. Information Agency in
         Washington.</p>
      <p>As a senior Fulbright Lecturer, Inge has taught at the
         University of Salamanca in Spain (1967-68) and at three
         institutions in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1971). On a third
         Fulbright appointment in 1979, he offered courses on American
         humor and literary regionalism at Moscow State University in
         the Soviet Union. As resident Scholar with USIA, he consulted
         and lectured abroad in eighteen countries, including France,
         Italy, Portugal, Japan, New Zealand, Thailand, Indonesia,
         Malaysia, and the People's Republic of China. More recently,
         he has lectured in Poland, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Finland,
         Denmark, England, Germany, and the Czech Republic. At the
         invitation of the Gorky Institute, he returned to the Soviet
         Union to participate in conferences on Sholokhov and Faulkner
         and the works of Eudora Welty. He has led travel-study courses
         to the Soviet Union in 1988 and China in 1989, and in 1994 he
         taught at Charles University in Prague on a fourth Fulbright
         lectureship.</p>
      <p>Among others, Inge teaches courses in American humor and
         satire and is the author or editor of over fifty books. His
         three-volume Handbook of American Popular Culture was cited by
         the American Library Association as an outstanding reference
         work in 1979 and was issued in a revised and expanded edition
         in 1989. In addition to his continuing interests in
         literature, Inge is also engaged in research on the history
         and development of American comic art, which resulted in his
         book "Comics as Culture."</p>
      <p>More recent publications include "Anything Can Happen in a
         Comic Strip," a study of self-referentiality in the comics,
         and "Charles M. Schulz: Conversations, a collection of
         interviews with the creator of Peanuts," the first in a series
         of such collections for which Inge is serving as the general
         editor for the University Press of Mississippi. Works in
         progress include books on the relations between American
         literature and the comics and the adaptation process in the
         films of Walt Disney."</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection is composed of materials collected by Dr.
         Inge relating to his academic studies of the comic arts,
         popular culture, and American literature. The bulk of the
         collection is dated from the 1950s onward and is made up of
         many unique items collected by Inge covering the history of
         the comic arts. It includes a large collection of published
         and unpublished materials and ephemera items relating to the
         comic arts. Manuscripts by Inge and other writers are also
         included. The collection contains correspondence with a number
         of noted artists and writers, including Art Spieglman, Mort
         Walker, Bruce Duncan, and Harold Foster, and comic arts
         scholars. The collection includes advertisements, fan club
         materials, posters, art prints, animation cells, comic strip
         and comic book samples, comic and animation character drinking
         glasses, numerous buttons, records, and various other
         collectable items. Other materials incorporate Inge's
         interests in American literature and include typescript copies
         of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Ellen Glasgow Newsletter</title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Frontier Home</title>, copies of
         literary journals, numerous publications, and correspondence.
         The collection also contains items of Dr. Inge's own personal
         collection of materials ranging from his grade school papers
         and school yearbooks to an autograph scrapbook and EC Fan Club
         dating from the 1950s.</p>
      <p>The collection is highlighted by a very large collection of
         reference journals including fanzines, newsletters, journals,
         and numerous other periodicals related to the comic arts.
         These periodical titles focus on the history and art of comic
         books and comic strips, cartoonists, comic book and comic
         strip characters, animation, and other aspects of the comic
         arts and popular culture. These materials, and the hundreds of
         comic books and reference books donated by Dr. Inge, have been
         incorporated into their own individual collections.</p>
