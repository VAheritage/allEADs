<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The Reverend Heslip Malbert "Happy" Lee (1922- ), minister and educator, social and political activist, has spent much of his life working to improve relations between blacks and whites. His life's work is
representative of many other like-minded individuals of his generation who were active in the cause for civil rights and equality in the last half of the 20th century. A native of Georgia, Lee's work during the
height of the struggle for civil rights brought him to Virginia in the early 1960s where he served as Executive Director of the Virginia Council on Human Relations. In the late 1960s and 1970s he served as a
consultant to various educational, urban, and community programs in North Carolina, Georgia, and other localities. [A detailed time line follows this brief biographical sketch.]
</p>
<p>Born in rural Polk County, Georgia on February 21, 1922, Heslip Malbert Lee is the son of Mary Camp Lee (1918-1983) and Malbert Warren Lee (1898-1976). Lee had two younger siblings, a sister, Virginia Lee, born
1924, and a brother, Charles Lee, who died at age 2. The Lee family were poor tenant farmers, raising cotton and corn, living without electricity and running water. Lee attended elementary and high school in Polk
County. The origin of the name "Happy" began when Lee's sister could not pronounce his first name. She eventually started calling him something that sounded like "Happy." Lee was at Junior College when the name
"Happy" began to be used by more than his family. One of his professors considered his name Heslip too hard to remember and asked him if he had a nickname. Lee recounted his sister calling him "Happy." The
professor preferred the nickname and it stuck.
</p>
<p>In 1941, Lee married Laura McClung (1924- ) of Haralson County. They later had five children: Dwain H. Lee, Glen L. Lee, Joan Lee, Stephen F. Lee (who died in 1994), and Laurie Lee. Happy Lee operated a dairy
farm and grocery business in Polk County. Ordained to "preach the Gospel" in October of 1949, Lee served as pastor of the Antioch Baptist Church in July of 1950. He would go on to serve as pastor of nearly a dozen
other Baptist churches in Georgia and other states.
</p>
<p>Lee received a B.A. Degree in Philosophy in June, 1954 from Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, and a Master of Divinity Degree in 1957 from Colgate-Rochester Divinity School. He became pastor of York Baptist
Church, in York, New York, while working in a number of local community organizations. He returned to Georgia and served two years, 1957-1959, as Director of Religious Activities, at Mercer University, in Macon.
</p>
<p>Lee served as pastor of First Baptist Church, in Springfield, Virginia, from 1959-1961 and became a member of the Board of Directors of the Virginia Council of Human Relations (VCHR), a biracial state wide
organization that worked to foster communication and improved relations between blacks and whites. Lee and his family moved to Richmond when he accepted the post as Executive Director of VCHR. He also served
during this time period, 1961-1964, as a member of the Virginia State Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.
</p>
<p>Lee was extremely active as VCHR's Executive Director. He worked to increase the number of local VCHR groups and overall membership; he spoke to numerous groups in both small and large settings; helped in the
desegregation of dozens of public facilities in Virginia; and monitored actions in Prince Edward County, Virginia, where county officials had closed their pubic schools in an effort to block school desegregation.
</p>
<p>In late 1964 Lee left Virginia and became Executive Director, Salisbury-Rowan Community Service Council, Inc., in Salisbury, North Carolina and served as Chairman, North Carolina State Advisory Committee to the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. In 1966 he began serving as Vice President for Development, Shaw University, Raleigh and continued to be active in the civil rights field in the state. Beginning in 1968 he would
serve for nearly ten years under a variety of titles acting as a consultant to several educational, urban, and community programs in North Carolina, Georgia, and other localities.
</p>
<p>Lee retired in 1978 in Cedartown, Georgia, and operated the family jewelry store and farmed. In the 1980s, he served in the "Minister-at-Large" program of the American Baptist Churches with assignments in
churches from New York to Utah. In the 1990s he chaired the 7th District (7 Counties) Democratic Party in Georgia and is credited with revitalizing the Polk County Democratic Party.

<p>This spiral bound notebook of correspondence contains over 200 letters that were arranged in chronological order by Lee.  Most are addressed to Lee but there are about a dozen letters by Lee to others.  Much of the correspondence concerns Lee's work as director of the Virginia Council on Human Relations (VCHR) 1960-1964; as Executive Director of the Salisbury-Rowan Community Service program in Salisbury, North Carolina, 1964-1966; and as Vice-President for Development at Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina, 1966-1967. Letters worth nothing include: David H. Scull, May 27, 1959, inviting Lee to serve as Executive Director of the Virginia Council on Human Relations; Richard Hocking, Chairman, Georgia Council on Human Relations, December 14, 1960, asking Lee to become its Executive Director; Leo E. Cloutier, Executive Vice-President, General Manager, Richmond Virginians baseball team, August 12, 1963, concerns the desegregation of Parker Field, Richmond, Virginia; Heslip M. Lee, September 26, 1963, addressed to Lee White, Special Assistant to the President of the United Sates, detailing the work of the VCHR, the desegregation of theaters and restaurants in Virginia, the situation in Prince Edward County, and Lee's invitation for the president to visit Richmond to deliver an address [an invitation to President Johnson to deliver an address from Lee and others is dated January 20, 1964]; Wyatt Tee Walker,  Executive Assistant, Southern Christian Leadership Conference, October 22, 1963, thanking Lee for the  "greatest convention in SCLC's History" and noting "the full use of the John Marshall's [a Richmond hotel] facilities represents a significant break-through in human relations;" and Norman Lee Williams, December 12, 1963, addressed to Rev. John J. Mahon, President, Richmond Council, Richmond-Petersburg Area Council on Human Relations, concerning William's preference for "the segregated way of life." The notebook also contains reports by Lee as a consultant to CAP (Community Action Program), the federal anti-poverty program, on his visits to localities throughout the South.  Correspondents also include individuals who were active in desegregation efforts in Virginia, especially Prince Edward County: members of the American Friends Service Committee, Inc., Cambridge Massachusetts; J. Rupert Picott, Executive Director, Virginia Teachers Association; Willie Carter, Prince Edward County Branch NAACP; J. Kenneth Morland, Chairman, Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Randolph-Macon Women's College, Lynchburg, Virginia; and L. Francis Griffin, Minister, First Baptist Church, Farmville, Virginia.

<p>This folder contains ten letters addressed to Lee and fourteen written by him during his tenure as pastor of the First Baptist Church, Springfield, Virginia, 1959-1961.  The letters were placed in chronological order by Lee.  Many of the letters focus on his resignation as pastor to become Executive Director of the Virginia Council of Human Relations in Richmond. In a mimeographed copy of one letter from 1960, addressed to a college freshman woman and a member of his church, Lee discussed his views about Lent, Ash Wednesday, and Good Friday.  This letter was to be used for discussion with a group of college students belonging to various different denominations.

<p>This spiral bound notebook of correspondence arranged chronological by Lee contains sixty-two letters, one from 1961, the others date from December of 1962 through December of 1963.  It was during this time period, 1961-1964, that Lee served as Executive Director of the Virginia Council on Human Relations (VCHR).  A significant number of letters are carbon copies sent by Lee to various recipients. Several of the letters are from or addressed by Lee to individuals at Mercer University, Macon, Georgia.  Lee graduated from the school in 1954.  He also worked for two years as Director of Religious Activities working with students and reporting to the president of the school.  Some of these letters concern what Lee described in a May 3, 1963 letter to the president of the school as "the removal of racial bars for admission to Mercer." The notebook contains a report by Mercer University President Rufus Harris dated April 18, 1963 to the trustees of the school on the need to racially integrate the University (a letter dated October 9, 1963 notes that Mercer University "just admitted three negroes").  Letters dated June 13, 1963 and July 23, 1963 concern Carl Braden (1914-1975), a noted white civil rights and political activist whose work in Virginia may have been considered counter productive by the VCHR.  There is also correspondence in September and October of 1963 discussing a possible "march on Nashville" (home to the Southern Baptist Convention) to highlight differences between progressive and conservative Baptists.

<p>These materials were originally bound together and include reports by Lee and correspondence (20 letters, 2 telegrams) documenting the work of Lee and the Virginia Council on Human Relations (VCHR) during the year 1964.  One letter addressed to Lee by Edward E. Haddock, a Richmond doctor, dated August 14, 1964, discussed Haddock's attendance at a meeting of the National Citizens Committee in Washington D.C. that focused on the implementation of the recently passed Civil Rights Acts.  Haddock informed Lee "I was quite proud to have an opportunity to speak in our work-shop session where I told the group that the best that had ever happened in Richmond to help us with our problems was when you came on the scene.  I went into some detail about how you have worked to enable miracles to come forth quietly."  Other materials include notes by Lee for his remarks at the Prince Edward County NAACP Freedom-Labor Day event, September 7, 1964 and notes for a speech he gave at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, February 17, 1964, entitled "Sociological Implications of the Present Situation."  The folder also contains a photocopy of the program for the VCHR sponsored event entitled "Consultation of Virginia Lawyers" held in Richmond, January 11, 1964, that included speakers Robert R. Merhige, Jr. (who later served as a Federal judge on the U. S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, from 1967 through 1998) and Nicholas Katzenbach (who was then U.S. Deputy Attorney General and directed federal enforcement of desegregation, later served as Attorney General 1965-1967 and then as Under Secretary of State 1966-1969).
