<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Encampment for Citizenship (EFC), a national youth program affiliated with the American Ethical Union, was founded in 1946, by Algernon D. Black, social activist and New York Society for Ethical Culture leader, and Alice K. (Nanny) Pollitzer, prominent civic leader and Ethical Culture Movement member. In response to the rise of fascism abroad and to the country's domestic problems of the day, it was their intention to create "community learning environments for youth which transcended racial, ethnic, class, religious and national boundaries," a vision inspired by their belief that "young people would grow as citizens and leaders if they lived and worked together in self-made democratic communities." From this experience, it was hoped that they would "develop a deeper knowledge of themselves and a vision of a more humane society."
</p>
<p>The EFC's primary objective became "the creation of a responsible, informed and effective citizenship among American youth" capable of helping to solve society's most complex and intractable problems, and the organization aimed to foster youth leadership and civic involvement within a decidedly multicultural framework. Program participants were encouraged to examine current political, social, and economic issues through a curriculum designed to develop critical thinking and leadership skills. Over the years, the program came to include internship and community service projects, field trips, political activities, and community government participation. In addition, a wide variety of workshops, discussion groups, and lectures were held, in which the following types of subjects would be explored: social and economic justice, health and poverty, criminal justice, international relations, human rights, the environment, labor politics, education reform, racism and sexism, community and economic democracy, and youth empowerment.
</p>
<p>Between the Encampment's inception in 1946 and dissolution in 1995, more than 7,000 young people from a diversity of racial, ethnic, religious, economic, and geographic backgrounds participated in EFC annual summer sessions, year-round leadership training programs, and various short-term projects. Some well-known EFC alumni include: Gale Brewer, Ada Deer, William Haddad, David Harris, Allard Lowenstein, Jean McGuire, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Charles Patterson, David Rothenberg, Hal Sieber, and Floyd "Red Crow" Westerman.
</p>
<p>For several decades, the EFC enjoyed a national reputation. Prominent Encampment supporters included Eleanor Roosevelt, who served as Chairwoman of the EFC Board of Sponsors from 1946 to 1962, and Martin Luther King, Jr. In the 1950s, the organization was viewed by some with suspicion, including the American Legion, which accused the EFC of being "un-American" and "socialistic." Widespread support for the organization continued through the 1970s, but began to wane in the 1980s within the country's conservative political climate. By the early 1990s, the Encampment had lost most of its funding base, which ultimately led to its demise. In 2010, efforts by former EFC leaders and alumni were begun to revive the Encampment, and there continues to be growing interest and support for a revitalization of the organization.
