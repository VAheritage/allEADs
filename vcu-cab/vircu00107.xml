<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Guy M. Kinman, Jr., son of a World War I veteran and Army officer, attended seminary after college. He then ministered to United Presbyterian Church congregations in Pennsylvania and Minnesota before serving as
a chaplain in the United States Air Force. By 1957 he began to phase himself out of the ministry and honorably resigned in 1959. He married in 1962 but divorced ten years later.
</p>
<p>Around 1980, Kinman who now worked as a personnel administrator, became interested and intricately involved in the gay and lesbian movement in Richmond. In 1983, a year after he retired, Kinman took the
position of president of the Richmond, Virginia Gay and Lesbian Alliance, the first statewide network of lesbians and gays. While in this position, Kinman, inspired by a similar act in Lynchburg and Roanoke,
Virginia, raised funds to purchase advertisements on billboards throughout the Richmond area. The signs read, "Someone you know is gay... Maybe someone you love" and gave Kinman's phone number. The ad campaign
attracted local and national attention. Kinman continues to live in the Richmond area.
