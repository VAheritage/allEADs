      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>George Carr was born in Albemarle County, Virginia on
         November 16, 1800, the son of Micajah Carr (1752-1812) and
         Elizabeth Wood. He received his education in local schools and
         through independent study, and on September 15, 1822 was
         licensed to practice law in Virginia, qualified as an attorney
         in the local bar, and practiced in Charlottesville. He was
         also involved in educational work for over ten years. In
         February 1855 Carr married Melinda Cahoon Poore (1827-1898),
         and several years later the couple moved to "The Barracks," a
         farm six miles northwest of Charlottesville where Hessian
         troops were imprisioned during the Revolutionary War. George
         Carr died on October 1, 1866.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists primarily of the correspondence of
         George Carr, but includes correspondence of other members of
         the Carr family of Albemarle County, Virginia, financial
         papers, legal documents and papers, genealogical records, and
         other miscellaneous papers and memorabilia.</p>
      <p>Much of the correspondence in the collection is between
         various members of the Levy family and concerns the
         maintenance and sale of "Monticello," the former home of
         Thomas Jefferson and later the home of Captain Uriah Phillips
         Levy, who bought the estate in 1836. George Carr, as
         commissioner for the liquidation of the estate, saw to the
         maintenance of the estate, both before and after Levy's death,
         and dealt with troublesome caretakers who sold shingles and
         bricks from the house and charged admission for tours of the
         estate. Captain Levy willed the estate to the United States
         government upon his death in 1862, but the will was
         successfully contested by his heirs. Arrangements to sell the
         estate dragged on for many years, and included in this
         collection are many letters from perspective buyers. Through
         George Carr's efforts, Jefferson Monroe Levy -- a United
         States congressman and lawyer from New York, and the nephew of
         Uriah Levy -- was finally able to purchase the estate from the
         other heirs in 1882. Also relating to "Monticello" are four
         letters to Thomas Jefferson in 1801 and 1802 from James
         Dinsmore regarding the building of "Monticello."</p>
      <p>Much of the remaining correspondence consists of letters
         from members of George Carr's family and from friends, which
         describe the hardships of life in Tennessee, Kentucky,
         Louisiana, South Carolina, and Missouri during the first half
         of the nineteenth century, and includes letters from Adare,
         Green, Hickman, and Todd counties in Kentucky; Cooper County,
         Pleasant Hill, and St. Louis in Missouri; Davidson, Wilson,
         and Shelby counties, and Memphis in Tennessee; Spartin county
         in South Carolina; and Natchez, Mississippi. Topics discussed
         include the frequency of crop failure, the cost of land, and
         interest rates.</p>
      <p>Prominent correspondents among Carr's friends are St.
         George Tucker, Thomas Walker Gilmer, Joseph Coolidge, George
         Wythe Randolph and John A. G. Davis. Several letters from
         Alexander Rives concern party politics in Virginia. A letter
         from William Cabell Rives presents George Carr to
         Vice-president Martin Van Buren. Also included is a letter
         from Joseph Jones Monroe, dated 23 April 1814, to President
         James Monroe regarding a Mr. Carr's opposition to the
         administration and containing some unfavorable remarks on
         Thomas Jefferson. The twentieth-century corresponence is
         primarily concerned with the Daughters of the American
         Revolution and their research into family lineage. The
         remaining non-business correspondence provides insights into
         life in the nineteenth century, and mentions such topics as
         the difficulties of travelling, the experiences of a student
         in a medical school in Philadelphia in 1829, a race riot in
         Philadelphia in 1842, and the prices of crops in various parts
         of the country.</p>
      <p>The financial papers date from ca. 1800-1939, and contain
         the bills, receipts, accounts, commodity price reports, and
         checks of George Carr and other members of the Carr family.
         Included among the financial papers is an itemized receipt for
         fees paid to the University of Virginia in 1837 by George
         Carr.</p>
      <p>The legal papers, dating from 1745 to 1882, contain
         indentures; wills; land deeds and grants; and other legal
         documents and copies of documents belonging to George Carr,
         his family, and his clients. Included is a copy of a legal
         brief (ca. 1804-1813) concering a dispute between Thomas
         Jefferson and David Michie over land at Milton, Virginia.
         Although the collection has many letters concerning
         "Monticello," it contains no legal documents relating to the
         settlement of the estate.</p>
      <p>Other items of interest in the collection include a
         twenty-one page speech draft, dated 1834, by William Cabell
         Rives, concerning his resignation from the U.S. Senate over
         orders from the Virginia Assembly to vote against Andrew
         Jackson's proposed decentralization of the second Bank of the
         United States. Also included are documents concerning the
         Virginia militia; land surveys and plats; genealogical
         material regarding the Poore, Carr, Cave, Cross, Tompkins, and
         Trevillian families; a recipe book; two report cards of
         University of Virginia students; and other miscellaneous
         papers, printed material, memorabilia, and photographs,
         inlcuding a photograph of "Our Mammy Sally," a Black
         woman.</p>

        <p>The four accessions have been filed separately. Each is
            organized in a similar fashion, with correspondence
            followed by legal papers, financial papers, broadsides and
            circulars, and other printed materials and memorabilia. In
            each section, correspondence and miscellaneous material
            regarding the sale of "Monticello" is filed separately from
            the rest of the correspondence. #4869-b, which is made up
            primarily of genealogical material, is divided between
            material on the Carr, Poore, and Tompkins families, and
            within each section by type of material: correspondence,
            legal papers, financial papers, genealogical material,
            printed material, and miscellaneous papers and
            memorabilia.</p>
