      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Balch Family Papers consist of ca. 170 items (9
         Hollinger boxes, two oversize folders, ca. 3.5 linear shelf
         feet), 1760 (1864-1928) 1955, correspondence, diaries,
         journals, financial papers, manuscripts, photographs, and
         miscellaneous bound volumes concerning Balch and Swift
         families of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Topics of interest
         include: family matters, the Civil War, European travels, art
         in Europe and America, the controversy over the discovery of
         the North Pole by Dr. Frederick Cookin 1908 and/or Robert
         Peary in 1909, and Arctic exploration.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the collection pertains to Edwin Swift Balch
         (1856-1927). Born in Philadelphia, he was the son of Thomas
         and Emily (Swift) Balch, and graduated from Harvard in 1878.
         After studying law under William Henry Rawle, he was admitted
         to the bar in 1882. He had a deep interest in the Cook-Peary
         controversy and was the author of several books on Polar
         exploration including 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The North Pole and Bradley
         Land</title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Antarctica.</title>Balch was married
         twice; first to Eugenia H. Macfarlane in 1904 and later, to
         Emily Topscott Clark in 1924. His papers, 1859-1927, chiefly
         pertain to his interest in polar exploration, especially the
         Cook-Peary controversy over the discovery of the Norht Pole,
         and consist of scrapbooks, letters to him regarding the
         article, "The North Pole Question," and miscellaneous related
         items. The scrapbooks reflect his interests in mountain
         exploration, glaciers, geography, geology, art, and various
         other subjects. Also present is his three- volume bound
         journal, 1859- 1906, which contains references to Philadelphia
         society, the Civil War in West Virginia, possible recognition
         of the Confederacy by Great Britain and France, the
         Philadelphia riots of 1864, the Suez Canal, the Sedan
         battlefield in the Franco-Prussian War, Theodore Roosevelt,
         Ferdinand de Lesseps, Henry Stanley, Richard Cobden, Arctic
         exploration and other topics. His partial diaries, 1903-1907,
         unpublished articles and short stories, miscellaneous volumes
         and photographs comprise the remainder of his papers.</p>
      <p>A special item of interest is his autograph book,
         1864-1943, which was later maintained by Emily Clark Balch. It
         contains autographs of Hervey Allen, George Bancroft, Hector
         Bolitho, John C. Breckenridge, James Buchanan, Struthers Burt,
         James Branch Cabell, George Catlin, Gustave Doré,
         Frederick Douglass, Hamilton Fish, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Richard
         Jordon Gatling, Ulysses S. Grant, Ellen Glasgow, Charles
         Gounod, Robert E. Lee, Eric Linklater, Henry Wadsworth
         Longfellow, Thomas B. Macaulay, George B. McClellan, Samuel
         F.B. Morse, Robert E. Peary, Burton Rascoe, John Meredith
         Read, William H. Seward, Henry M. Stanley, Charles Sumner,
         Carl Van Vechten, Richard Wagner (with the opening bars from
         Lohengrin), James Watson Welt, William E. Woodward, and
         others.</p>
      <p>Emily Swift Balch (Mrs. Thomas Balch), 1832-1917, was teh
         mother of Edwin. Her papers, 1852-1917, consist of letters
         from her father, Joseph Swift, photographs, and typescript
         excerpts from her journals. These volumes contain references
         similar to those of her son's, and in addition, information
         about fighting near Leestown, West Virginia during the Civil
         War, Mosby's Raiders, her trip to Europe, Napoleon III, the
         Paris Commune, Henry M. Stanley and Ferdinand de Lesseps. Also

         Balch. His papers, 1825-1881, consist of typescripts of his
         letters and journals which describe events in his various
         trips through the United States and Europe including his
         presentation to Louis Phillipe, a performance by Jenny Lind,
         the London Exhibition of 1851 and a visit with Prince Klemens
         von Metternich.</p>
      <p>Thomas Willing Balch (ca. 1868-1927) a brother of Edwin
         Balch, was a noted lawyer. After attending Harvard, the
         University of Pennsylvania, and Trinity College, he began his
         law practice in Philadelphia and was the author of numerous
         books on jurisprudence. His papers, 1924, consist of an
         account book and an indenture.</p>

         of typescripts of her letters from Switzerland in 1886.</p>
      <p>Thomas Balch (1821-1877) was the originator of the idea of
         an international tribunal to settle the claims for damages
         inflicted by the Confederate raider, Alabama. His papers
         include typescripts of his letters and diaries, 1837-1921,
         which contain references to Sherman's march through Georgia, a
         demonstration of a Gatling gun, and his meeting Henry Stanley
         in Cairo, Egypt during 1867. There is also a photograph of his
         gravestone.</p>

         Towanda, Pennsylvania, the daughter of James and Mary
         (Overton) Macfarlane. She studied art at various institutions
         including Vassar College and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine
         Arts, and travelled to Europe for further study. She married
         Edwin Swift Balch in 1904 and continued to paint and exhibit,
         notably at the Paris Exposition of 1900. She and her husband
         published 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Art and Man</title>in 1920, and she was
         a member of various organizations including the Pennsylvania
         Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the
         Pennsylvania Historical Society, and the Daughters of the
         American Revolution. Her papers, 1885-1912, consist of deeds
         of trust, unpublished stories and articles, her Vassar
         sketchbook, various bound volumes, and an account of her life
         by her husband.</p>

         of Edwin Swift Balch. She was the daughter of the Rev. Dr.
         William Meade and Nancy (Tapscott) Clark, and eventually

         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Reviewer.</title>Her papers,
         1920-1929, 1944, and 1955, include a series of essays written
         by Joseph Hergesheimer (and later published as 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Presbyterian Child</title>) and
         dedicated to her, a minute book kept by her as secretary of
         the Little Theatre League Club, various letters to her, a
         biographical sketch, a newspaper clipping, and autographs of
         Amélie and Pierre Troubetzskoy.</p>
      <p>The typescript copy of a diary of Joseph Shippen
         (1728-1800) prominent Philadelphia merchant and loyalist, and
         father-in-law of Benedict Arnold, pertains to his European
         tour of 1760-1761 during which he visited Italy, Switzerland,
         Germany, Luxemburg, Belgium, and Great Britain. Shippen
         included itemized lists of expenses for his journey.</p>
