      <p>Walter Frank (1882-1969) was a civil liberties lawyer who
         practiced in the law offices of Kurzman &amp; Frank in New
         York. He was also vice-chairman of the executive committee of
         the Citizens Union, a member of the national board of the
         American Civil Liberties Union, the National Consumers League,
         and the Citizens League for Industrial Democracy. He received
         the Citizenship award from the League for Industrial Democracy
         in 1956 and a citation for exceptional civic service from the
         Citizens Union in 1966. Throughout his life, Frank was known
         as an advocate for civil liberties and racial equality, and
         was very active in trying to meet these goals.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Papers, 1943-1965, pertaining to the American Civil
         Liberties Union include correspondence and reports. There are
         letters from Dorothy Kenyon (1888-1972), December 9, 1942 re
         the Civil Liberties Defense Fund; Roger N. Baldwin (1884- ),
         October 17, 1944, re the Railway Mail Association; Varian Fry,
         January 8, 1956, re ACLU elections; and, John De Jarnette
         Pemberton, Jr., September 20, 1966 and July 15 &amp; 22,
         August 1, 1968, re ACLU business and board election results.
         Other items include the ACLU by-laws, December 3, 1957 and two
         reports, "Bibliography on Academic Freedom," May 1959 and "The
         ACLU's 1965 Expansion Program," September 1, 1965. Papers,
         1943-1950, relating to the Bar Association consist of numerous
         reports of the Committee on the Bill of Rights. Papers,
         1939-1970, concerning Frank's other civic service include
         letters and speeches about the League for Industrial Democracy
         1956 Award for distinguished public service and the Citizens
         Union 1966 Award for exceptional civil service. There are
         letters of congratulations from Dorothy Kenyon (1888-1972)
         (telegram), Newbold Morris (1902-1966), Karl E. Meyer, Norman
         (Mattoon) Thomas (1884-1968) (electrostatic copy), and Roger
         Nash Baldwin (1884- ). Also included are two statements,
         January 1956, by John Haynes Holmes (1879-1964) and Richard S.
         Childs, concerning Frank's civic accomplishments. Papers,
         1962, concerning the Civil Liberties Center at New York
         University School of Law, include letters of Norman Dorsen,
         director, and a report entitled "A Summary of State Decisions
         on Standing to Challenge Unconstitutional State Action in New
         York." Papers, 1945-1946, concerning the Equal Rights
         Amendment contain letters from Dorothy S. McAllister, Chairman
         of the National Committee to Defeat the Un-Equal Rights
         Amendment.</p>
      <p>Personal correspondence, 1925-1969, of Walter and Adelaide
         Frank cover a variety of topics. The letters are arranged
         alphabetically by last name of the correspondent. There is an
         interesting letter, December 6, 1930, from anarchist Alexander
         Berkman (1870-1936) in St. Tropez, France, concerning his
         recent activities and his possible fate. Letters from LeRoy
         Bowman (1887-1971) discuss his book, tentatively entitled 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Stumbling Toward Democracy: a grass
         high view of organization in America</title>, April 6, 1967,
         and a League for Industrial Democracy election, April 30,
         1969. Letters, 1942- 1961, from Abram Lincoln Harris
         (1899-1963) are rich in relating the feelings and experiences
         of a black man in the academic world. In a letter of [1948?]
         he writes about being recommended for a position with tenure
         at Chicago University, commenting that his "Alma Mater will go
         very slowly in the matter of giving a Negro a major
         appointment on the faculty." On July 17, 1949, from London, he
         relates the conditions of blacks living and working in England
         and his own experiences with prejudice there. Elinore
         Morehouse Herrick (1895-1964) and John Haynes Holmes
         (1879-1964) both comment on the Franks' proposal to share
         their books with others through a lending process, October
         1950. There are also several letters from Holmes about the
         Roger Baldwin Foundation lectures (July 15, 1952 and May 17,
         September 15, 1955). There is a letter, October 13, 1939, from
         Cordell Hull (1871-1955), giving an explanation of the goals
         and functions of the Department of State, especially its
         Division of Cultural Relations. He expresses his desire to
         have cooperation between the government and "the numerous
         public and private institutions and organizations" in working
         toward a better understanding between the American people and
         other countries, and extends an invitation to Frank to
         participate in a Conference on Inter-American Relations in the
         Field of Education. A letter, March 19, 1960, from Joseph P.
         Lash (1909- ), refers to his concerns over Germany's future
         and his opposition to reunification. Henry Morgenthau
         (1856-1946) writes on March 23, 1933, in answer to an inquiry
         concerning a possible Commission to Russia. There are two
         invitations, one to appear as a guest on Edward R. Murrow's
         (1908-1965) "This I Believe" Program, and one from Eleanor
         Roosevelt (1884-1962) for dinner at the White House on January
         28, 1941. On September 25, 1946, Gaetano Salvemini (1873-1957)
         writes in appreciation of a check for the Italian School of
         Pisa and its part toward "international cooperation." Two
         letters, June 1 and 22, 1931, from architect William Sanger,
         concern the College Art Association's desire to exhibit
         Frank's watercolors, "The Derelict" and "On the Shrewsbury
         River," in their travelling show. There are also letters from
         Elmer Rice (1892-1967), Bayard Rustin (1910- ), Wallace
         Stanley Sayre (1905- 1972), Harbans Singh (1921- ), Norman
         Thomas (1884-1968), and Jean Starr Untermeyer (1886-1970). A
         letter, July 26, 1936, signed "Leon," discusses observations
         made in Leningrad and Moscow, U.S.S.R. following the new
         constitution. Comments are made on various aspects of life,
         including work-related areas, housing, and costs; education,
         particularly libraries and new schools; the existence of art,
         historical, and industrial museums, and places for
         entertainment. There are references to the state of flux and
         the suggestions and criticisms (about the constitution) from
         many sources.</p>
      <p>There are also miscellaneous items including newspaper
         articles on Adelaide (Schulkind) and Walter Frank,
         certificates of appointment, 1921 and 1928, and poetry
         concerning a visit to Mexico. In addition, there are several
         photographs of Frank, both in work and social settings and
         accepting the L.I.D. 1956 Award. Papers, 1942-1947, concerning
         Powers of Attorney include several letters from Randolph
         Evernghim Paul (1890- 1956) and D. Spencer Bliss ( -1950). Of
         special interest are letters, 1930-1931, of Katherine Anne
         Porter while in Mexico. The three letters written to Frank are
         very open and revealing, discussing various aspects of her
         writing and immediate plans for the future. Porter was in
         Mexico following the advise of her physician to go to a warmer
         climate. Apparently, Frank was her benefactor, as she writes
         "without your help I could not have stayed here so long...,"
         and asks for an extension of the help. She explains that she
         has applied for the Guggenheim Fellowship but won't hear
         anything until March, and meanwhile has had various offers
         from magazines. She expresses her belief that she will be able
         to finish her novel [ 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Thieves' Market</title>] and reach a
         healthy state if allowed to stay a few months more in Mexico.
         She refers to being a little homesick and missing her friend
         Becky [Crawford]. Also, in her letter of December 14, 1930,
         she notes that she is sending an inscribed copy of her 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Flowering Judas</title>. In her letter
         of January 26, 1931, she relates how she wrote and completed
         her first story, "Maria Concepcion," discusses her view of
         limited editions, and describes events during the earthquake
         that nearly destroyed Oaxaca, Mexico. Her letter of April 7,
         1931, reveals that she has been accepted for the Guggenheim
         Fellowship, and that she will be ready to begin her second
         novel in October. There are also fifteen snapshots of scenes
         in Mexico, including three of Porter.</p>
      <p>Professional Correspondence includes letters from Newbold
         Morris (1902-1966), May 16, 1961; Stanley Myer Isaacs

      <p>Material on Charlotte Wilder includes two letters and a
         transcript of an article, November 1, 1934, relating the
         relationship between Frank and Wilder. In a letter dated
         "Friday," she encloses ten of her poems and discusses her
         manner of writing prose. There are also two letters from
         Evelyn Scott with the Wilder material.</p>
      <p>Among the bound volumes are two sets of family journals,
         "Our Days" (1957-1967) and "Woodland House Log" (1949-1957).
