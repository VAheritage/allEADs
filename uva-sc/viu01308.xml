         <p>Charles Anthony (1883- ) was a Campbell County, Va.,
         teacher and poet, holding positions at Concord State Normal
         School, Athens, W. Va., and State Teachers College,
         Harrisonburg, Va. She was the author of <title render="italic">Amethyst Mist.</title>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>There are ca. 134 items, 1895-1929, and n.d., pertaining to
         Charles Anthony (1883- ), of "Walnut Hill," Evington,
         Virginia. The correspondence is chiefly of a personal nature.
         In 1906, a friend offers sympathy for her blues and comments
         on 
         <title render="italic">Roughing It</title> by Mark Twain and 
         <title render="italic">Lucile</title> [by Owen Meredith]. A
         1909 letter concerns the romantic relationship of the writer
         and his girlfriend, and comments that football may be doomed
         as there have been too many fatalities this year. A 1925
         typescript letter concerns a train ride through Roanoke and
         Lynchburg and the resulting visit in Evington. There is a
         letter, January 13, 1929, from Anthony to [John Calvin]
         Metcalf, a former professor, concerning her little volume of
         verse. Among the educational papers are letters and other
         papers concerning her work at Concord State Normal School and
         a salary dispute and three tributes to Anthony from students.
         There are one postcard photograph of a young lady and two
         negatives of a woman [Charles Anthony?]. The majority of the
         collection consists of poetry and prose by Anthony, both
         titled and untitled, and in autograph and typed versions.
         There is a 25-page typed manuscript entitled <title render="doublequote">White Birds,
         Flying.</title>
