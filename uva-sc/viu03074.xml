         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>There are two letters, July 23, 1806 and September 25,
         1810, from Wilson Cary Nicholas (1761-1820), U. S. senator and
         governor of Virginia, to his brother-in-law, General Samuel
         Smith (1752-1839), American politician. Wilson Cary Nicholas
         was married to the general's sister Margaret Smith (1765-1849)
         ca. 1783; they were the parents of Jane Hollins (1798-1871),
         who later became Mrs. Thomas Jefferson Randolph. Wilson Cary
         Nicholas (1761-1820) was the son of Robert Carter (1715-1780)
         and Anne (Cary) Nicholas. He had three brothers: George
         (1754-1799); John (1756-1819); and, Philip Norborne
         (1773-1849). George married General Samuel Smith's sister Mary
         (1755-1806); they had several children including Robert Carter
         ( -1857); Samuel Smith (1797-1869), Georgianna [George Ann?],
         Betsy [Elizabeth?], Cary, and Nelson [children mentioned in
         this letter].</p>
         <p>On July 23, 1806, Wilson Cary Nicholas, "Warren," Albemarle
         County, Virginia, writes to his brother-in-law Samuel Smith,
         Baltimore, Maryland, upon receiving news of the death of
         sister [Mary (Smith)] Nicholas. He discusses the financial
         hardships following the death of his brother [George in 1799]
         and his dealings with the estate, estimating that "the house,
         lands, and Negroes, which is held in our names, and in mine,
         at [near] $40000..." Nicholas attempts to make financial
         arrangements to pay his own debts and the debts of the estate.
         One major concern of this letter is the disposition of the
         children of George and Mary (Smith) Nicholas, now dependent on
         Nicholas, Smith, and [ ] Morrison, who are apparently their
         guardians. Nicholas thinks it best for Georgianna and Betsy to
         live with close friends for awhile; and, he entrusts young
         Samuel to the general. He also mentions Cary and Nelson, who
         have been educated and supported at his own expense, as being
         the children of his dearest friends; and, he is concerned
         specifically about Nelson who "came to me so young, and has
         lived with me so long, that I feel towards him as if he was my
         own child..." He is also disturbed by [George's son]Robert
         being unfit to help with the children, claiming him unfit as a
         proper guardian for his five sisters.</p>
         <p>On September 25, 1810, Nicholas, "Warren," Albemarle
         County, writes to Smith, Baltimore, upon hearing the news that
         C[ ] N[ ] would be in the neighborhood and hoping that he
         would not have the impudence to attempt to visit. He mentions
         his distress over the silence and absence of Robert [Carter
         Nicholas], questioning how he supports himself, and further
         commenting on his neglect of his employers and parents. He
         also makes financial arrangements with Smith regarding the
         breeding of Merino sheep.</p>
