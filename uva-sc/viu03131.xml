      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection contains the written memories of a
         Confederate surgeon during the Confederate Army's retreat and
         surrender at Appomattox Court House. The journal begins around
         March 21, 1865 and concludes near the end of April that same
         year. It is a very through narrative on the retreat as well as
         an entertaining piece of writing. The surgeon provides
         excellent detail of his activities during the last days of the
         Civil War. He apparently leaves out nothing. His writing
         discusses both the military campaigns and the civilian life
         surrounding them. Unfortunately, the identification of the
         surgeon remains a mystery. He does not identify himself or his
         regiment, although he does mention some of his fellow surgeons
         by name (who do not appear in the Appomattox Rosters taken
         after the surrender.) The journal does provide a very good
         sense of who this man was, and how the war affected him.</p>
      <p>The surgeon begins his narrative describing conditions at
         the time. He discusses life on the field of battle, using a
         humorous tone even with such terribly depressing topics. He
         tells stories with humor in almost every incident. One example
         of this humor is his story of a battle: He was sitting on the
         ground, eating a rare meal, when a fellow soldier crashes into
         him, causing him to drop his food. His reaction of anger for
         losing his meal is pushed aside when he finds himself in the
         middle of a skirmish; bullets and cannon balls whiz by,
         forcing him to take cover.</p>
      <p>His narrative does get serious and provides a clear sense
         of the gravity with which he lives everyday. During the
         retreat, he discusses the dire circumstances of the army. The
         battles become more intense as the war nears its close. He
         mentions the lack of food, the drudgery of the retreat, people
         sleeping with insufficient cover, and the wounded and ill not
         receiving medical treatment because the hospitals were
         destroyed or captured.</p>
      <p>He discusses the battle of Five Forks and Gettysburg as
         well as the seizures of Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia. He
         writes about the terrible fate of a train-load of wounded men
         who, due to a cut in the tracks, cannot make it to Petersburg
         and are left on the tracks for some time. He gives a vivid
         account of the Union Army's pursuit of the Confederates. Yet,
         after the surrender, he tries to put their actions in
         perspective even after they had destroyed most of the things
         he held dear. Most of his belongings were burned during the
         seige of the hospital and the burning of the train depot.</p>
      <p>The narrative moves easily from military matters to
         civilian ones. The surgeon gives comical descriptions of his
         horse, Satan, citing stories in which he constantly loses his
         horse. The surgeon's personal views come out very well in his
         writing and his style is clear and easily understood. The
         civilian aspect of his narrative focus mostly on his life and
         those he meets. The "diary" also gives a brief description of
         life after surrender, giving an impression of what life was
         like for the Confederate soldier after the war. The surgeon
         describes the trip home for himself and a band of fellow
         soldiers; and, he talks about Satan, his horse, being put out
         to pasture.</p>
