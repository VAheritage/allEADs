      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection, ca. 57 items, 1936-1948, n.d., of the
         papers of George Conrad Westervelt (1879-1956), consists of
         correspondence, manuscripts, and photographs. Westervelt was a
         pioneer of aviation in America and China. He was a graduate of
         the United States Naval Academy and attended the Massachusetts
         Institute of Technology where he studied naval architecture.
         He later became involved in the Boeing line of aircraft,
         assisting in the design of a seaplane. During the First World
         War he supervised the construction of naval aircraft; after
         the war he continued to design naval aircraft, commanding the
         Naval Aircraft Factory at Philadelphia until 1927. He then
         retired and joined the Curtiss-Wright organization. In 1929,
         Curtiss-Wright and the Chinese government formed a partnership
         in the China National Aviation Corporation. Curtiss- Wright
         hoped to market their planes in China through this
         corporation's efforts. The company's plans went awry due to
         the Great Depression and the Chinese government was asked to
         subsidize the operation. Westervelt was sent to China in
         December of 1930 to insure the economical operation of CNAC.
         Westervelt married Miss Rieta Brabham Langhorne of Lynchburg,
         Virginia, on December 20, 1927; they had two daughters, Sally
         Cary and Effie Eda. [Additional biographical information on
         Westervelt may be found in the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">National Cyclopaedia of American
         Biography</title>43:103-4 '61]</p>
      <p>The correspondence is from the period Westervelt spent in
         China. The letters, 1930-1932, to John Sanderson and C. M.
         Keys are filled with the details of the daily operations and
         decisions Westervelt was called upon to make. The letters,
         1931-1932, to his wife, the former Miss Rieta Brabham
         Langhorne, describe the escalating tensions between China and
         Japan, as well as the military advances the Japanese made in
         Shanghai. The manuscript entitled "Shanghai to Chungking and
         Return" describes Westervelt and a colleague's trip by air and
         boat to Chungking while trying to determine the viability of
         extending the corporation's flights to Chungking. This 69-page
         typescript describes in great detail most of their activities,
         and includes Westervelt's observations on the economic and
         political climate of the towns they travelled through. There
         are also observations and descriptions of the everyday
         activities of the natives; Westervelt and his colleague were
         given the opportunity to buy two young Chinese girls in
         Chungking. He also describes the negotiations with local
         Chinese officials to set up an air route for mail and
         eventually passengers. There is also a manuscript, October
         1925, of ca. 125 pages, entitled "Mongolia," a melodrama in
         three acts by Westervelt.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous letters include one dated April 4, 1923, from
         H[oward Everett] Giles (1876-1955) to Miss Rieta Langhorne,
         concerning her art work and mentioning his own work. There are
         also miscellaneous photographs and other items relating to
         Miss Elizabeth Dortch Emory and her wedding in Chapel Hill,
         North Carolina.</p>
