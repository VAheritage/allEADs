      <p>Col. Fletcher Harris Archer was a Petersburg, Va. lawyer.
         Archer was a student at the University of Virginia and served
         as a captain during the Mexican War and a colonel in the
         Confederate Army.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of two one page letters to Colonel
         F.H. Archer of Petersburg, Virginia, from Robert A. Stiles
         (1836-1905) and John Willcox Brown (b. 1833), both Confederate
         officers and former University of Virginia students. John
         Willcox Brown, a Baltimore banker and president of the
         Maryland Trust Company, writes from Petersburg, July 16, 1868,
         to Archer, as Chairman of the Executive Committee, that his
         absence from home for the next two or three months will
         prevent him from discharging his duties as a member of the
         Executive Committee of the Conservative Party of Petersburg
         and that he must resign from the committee. He does promise to
         be present on the day of voting.</p>
      <p>The Richmond lawyer, Robert A. Stiles, writes on December
         22, 1875, to Archer at Petersburg, expressing regret that
         Archer had not received his previous letter or postal which
         said that he had examined the legal case against the railroad
         company with all the witnesses that could be secured and
         thought favorably of it. He promises to interview the officers
         of the railroad company and to try to get an advantageous
         settlement without a suit as there is a difference of opinion
         among the witnesses as to the speed of the train at the time
         of the accident.</p>
