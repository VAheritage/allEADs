      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>One of the first public schools in Charlottesville dates back to [1881] and was named
                "Midway Grammar and High School" or Primary School, and was the school for white
                children. It was also referred to as Lane or Charlottesville School (although a high
                school was built in 1940 which was also named Lane after Principal James Walker
                Lane). Midway was located on the east end of Main Street and originally provided
                education for elementary, middle and high school students. There was a school for
                "Negroes" which was the "Jefferson Graded School" and was located in the Delevan
                Hotel building on 632 Main Street in 1865. It was later moved to Brown and Fifth
                Street Northwest [1926] near the western edge of the Vinegar Hill neighborhood. New
                schools were soon constructed, McGuffey Elementary in 1916 located on Second Street;
                Venable Elementary was built on Fourteenth Street in 1922; George Rogers Clark
                Elementary School was built in Belmont in 1930; and Lane High School was built on
                Preston Avenue and McIntire Road in 1940. These schools were built under the careful
                scrutiny of James G. Johnson, who was the Superintendent of Schools from1909 to 1946
                and knew every detail of the construction. According to his correspondence,
                overseeing the construction on a weekly if not a daily basis caused him many
                sleepless nights and exhausted him physically and mentally.</p>
      <p>Fendall R. Ellis was the next school superintendent from 1947 to 1964 and had the
                difficult task of trying to keep the schools open during desegregation. He was
                included in the lawsuits in all three of the important court cases in
                Charlottesville and worked closely with the attorney for the School Board, John S.
                Battle, Jr. Ellis tried to mediate between massive resisters and the National
                Association for the Advancement of Colored People in order to keep the schools open
                during desegregation.</p>
      <p>As the number of school buildings multiplied and the issue of desegregation gained
                acceptance, the next school superintendents wrestled with more general issues in
                education, such as budgets, overcrowding, quality of education, new methods of
                teaching, the safety of students, busing, sex education in schools, and maintaining
                diversity in all of the Charlottesville City Schools. These school superintendents
                were George C. Tramontin from 1963 to 1966; Edward R. Rushton from 1967 to 1972;
                William J. Ellena from 1973 to 1981; Thomas J. McLernon from 1981 to 1982; Vincent
                C. Cibbarelli from 1982 to 1989; Joseph R. McGeehan from 1990 to 1995, and Dorothea
                Shannon [1996-2001].</p>

              <p>Comments include [they would be] "perfectly willing to abolish the
                                present public school system" rather than "see mixed schools in
                                Virginia;" "The negro is a pure jungle product;" "white children
                                attend school during one part of the day and the Negro children
                                attend during the other part of the day;" "Isenhower [sic] is a

                                The Court ruled that as long as the School Board was acting in good
                                faith and trying to take steps toward integration, there would not
                                be any punitive action taken against them.</p>

                                Mr. Battle explained that if they took that action, the state would
