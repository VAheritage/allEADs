            <head>Biographical Information</head>
            <p>Wilson Cary Nicholas (January 31, 1761-October 10, 1820) was an American
                politician who served in the U.S. Senate from 1799 to 1804 and was the Governor of
                Virginia 1814 to 1816. Nicholas was born in Williamsburg, Virginia where he attended
                the College of William and Mary. According to Nicholas's entry in the <title
                    render="italic">Biographical Directory of the United States Congress</title>, he
                served in the American Revolutionary War as commander of George Washington's Life
                Guard until the unit disbanded in 1783. This appears to be an error: his entry in
                    <title render="italic">American National Biography</title> states that "he
                commanded Virginia volunteer units from the fall of 1780 until the following fall,
                but there is no evidence that he was actually involved in battlefield action." He
                married Margaret Smith of Baltimore, Maryland, and settled at "Warren" in Albemarle
                County where he became a member of the Virginia House of Delegates 1784-1789
                and a delegate to the ratifying convention of 1788 which approved the Federal
                Constitution.</p>
            <p>Robert Carter Nicholas (1728-1780) was the nephew of Wilson Cary Nicholas and
                the son of Dr. George Nicholas and Elizabeth Carter Burwell Nicholas (widow of
                Nathaniel Burwell) of Williamsburg, Virginia. His father migrated to Virginia; his
                mother was the daughter of wealthy Virginia landowner, Robert "King" Carter of
                    <title render="underline">Corotoman</title>. Born January 28, 1728/9, both
                parents were dead by 1734. He studied law at the College of William and Mary and
                practiced in the general court under the royal government. He served in the House of
                Burgesses, 1755-61 as the representative from York County, and from 1766-1775
                as the representative of James City County, and was Treasurer for the colony of
                Virginia, 1766-1775. He was a member of the Virginia General Assembly from
                1776 to 1778 and in 1779 was appointed to the high court of chancery. Nicholas
                married Anne Cary, daughter of Wilson Cary of Warwick County in 1751 and the couple
                had four daughters and six sons.</p>

            <p>George Nicholas, born in Williamsburg about 1754, was the son of Robert Carter
                Nicholas, treasurer of Virginia from 1766 to 1776, and a great grandson of Robert
                "King" Carter. He attended the College of William and Mary and became a noted
                attorney. Nicholas was a lieutenant colonel in the Continental army but spent much
                of his time in Baltimore and did not participate in any significant engagements.
                During service in the House of Delegates in 1778-1779, 1781-1782, 1783,
                and from 1786 to 1788, the last three terms representing Albemarle County, Nicholas
                became friendly with James Madison. Elected to the Virginia Ratification Convention
                of 1788, Nicholas followed Madison's lead and spoke in favor of ratification of the
                proposed new Constitution. Soon after the convention, he moved west to Kentucky,
                where he had a distinguished career as an attorney, as a leading member of the
                Kentucky Constitutional Convention of 1792, and as the first attorney general of the
                state and professor of law at Transylvania University. Nicholas wrote important
                letters on western affairs to Madison and to Thomas Jefferson, which George
                Washington also read, and tried to convince the federal government to increase its
                military presence in the West to protect settlers from Indian incursions and to
                secure westerners' access to the Mississippi River. George Nicholas died in
                Lexington, Kentucky, on July 25, 1799. (Library of Virginia website:

                                tobacco. Also expresses Norton's sympathies in regard to taxation

                                every possible honor and believes he will be missed greatly in the
                                [Senate?]. Believes the Senate grows weaker at every change and says
                                that Mr. [Thomas?] Worthington has taken the head and quotes boldly
                                what the President wants. The President must attend to public
                                opinion. Smith was told that [John] Armstrong (1758-1843),
                                minister to France, had completely lost the confidence of his
                                friends, and that to buoy him up, [President Jefferson] joined
                                [James] Bowdoin to Armstrong to help make the final arrangements
                                with Spain. The Vice President [George Clinton] told [Jefferson]
                                that there was such hostility to Armstrong that any treaty made by
                                him would be in danger. Smith states, "The business is to bribe
                                France with seven millions of dollars to counsel [miserable?] Spain
                                to give us the Floridas &amp; fix our western boundary. The vote of
                                Senate, the recommendations &amp; Entreaty of Friends, desiring a
                                Mission might be sent to London had no effect on the President- he

                                the "loud language of John Randolph" [of Roanoke?], the need to
                                replace [James] Monroe "(who is notorious)" in Great Britain with a
                                Federalist, who is a well-informed merchant, and comments about
                                Randolph, "I am far from approving the conduct of Mr. R. It was
                                highly indiscreet &amp; improper - had done a great deal of

                                will shake the confidence of the people in the President." He also
                                refers to the Speaker [Joseph Hopper?] Nicholson's disgust and
                                determination to leave public life, the Spanish pressing on the

                                considered as a third person on the Spanish mission. Instead, Smith
                                believed that "the place I ought to have been named for was a third
                                with Monroe and Pinckney to make the Commercial Treaty at Great

                                Cary Nicholas ?], writes that although the advice in his letter was
                                sound and was read by several department heads and the President, it
                                has not been adopted. He discusses a letter from Armstrong
                                explaining the recent arming of Austria who plans engineering an
                                armed mediation, "its object is a separate peace between France,
                                Russia, Prussia, and Sweden, leaving the field of battle to France
                                and England. In such case the commerce and manufactures of G[reat]
                                B[ritain] will be excluded from the North of Europe - from the
                                Med[iterranean] - from Turkey - and if to this list
                                American be added - the downfall of G[reat] B[ritain] may be
                                pronounced as a certainty." Smith believes now is the time for the
                                United States to insist on its rights and privileges as a neutral
                                power and join the powers of Europe to resist the tyranny of the
                                seas by the British. But he says "To any such course however Mr.
                                Jefferson and Mr. Madison are [greatly] averse. Skilled as they both
                                are in the use of the pen, they presume altogether upon its powers."
                                A British vessel has withdrawn from Hampton Roads, Virginia, to Lynn
                                Haven Bay, Florida, but he expects more examples of arrogance from
                                the British fleet. Smith approves the actions of the people of
                                Norfolk who have erected guns on their fort.</unittitle>

                                especially those trading in India; notes that General James
                                Wilkinson is concerned that he might be implicated in the Burr
                                Conspiracy but according to Smith "I have little fear for the
                                Integrity of his Character - that he may have been indiscreet
                                I can easily believe - that in the Confidence of long
                                friendship and a high very high opinion of Burr he may have said [or
                                even?] written things that may require explanation. I can believe
                                but that he has ever harbored a dishonorable Intention against the
                                Interest or the fidelity he owed his country, I neither can nor will
                                believe." Smith supposes the judge intends on stopping the trial of
                                Burr for treason and permit the jury to find him guilty of a
                                misdemeanor instead. Gives information concerning a French pirate

                                Wilson Cary Nicholas, answers a question posed by Nicholas, "I
                                should prefer a foreign to a civil war. If there be any prospect of
                                the efficacy of the embargo &amp; non- intercourse as [?] measures,
                                I should still be inclined to give scope to their action. Of this,
                                you are more competent to decide at Washington, than we are here."
                                Cabell believes that the United States should prepare for war in
                                case it should come. Peace would always be preferable because "the
                                embargo deprives our enemies of the trade of only one country, but
                                us of that of the whole world." Cabell also discusses a letter from
                                Mr. Yancey which states that all the delegates from [John Randolph
                                of Roanoke ?]'s district have urged him to oppose Randolph in the
                                next election. "Randolph's conduct seems to inspire general disgust.
                                The common remark is, he makes mischief wherever he is, &amp; it is
