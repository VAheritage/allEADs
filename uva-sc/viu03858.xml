</head>
      <p>Francis L. Berkeley, Jr. was born in Albemarle County, Virginia on April 9, 1911. He received his bachelor's degree at the University of Virginia in 1934. He worked in the Virginia room at the library from 1934
to 1937 under curator, John Cook Wyllie and university archivist, Lester J. Cappon. While working there, he finished his M.A. thesis in the history department on the calendar of the Berkeley Papers, 1653- 1767.
After several years as a history teacher, he returned to the University of Virginia Library and organized the new Manuscripts Division and set up its catalogues. He was a captain in the U.S Navy and was on Naval
Leave duty from 1942-1946. On his return he became Curator of Manuscripts. During this time, manuscript collecting was accelerated to over three million manuscripts.
</p>
      <p>Berkeley was the author of many letters promoting the efforts and achievements of other researchers. He was also a research scholar in his own right and undertook small studies in colonial history such as the
John Rolfe and Jefferson studies and the letters and diaries of Robert "King" Carter. In 1952-1953 he received a Fulbright scholarship in Scotland which helped him to establish the Virginia Colonial Records
Project. He was a Guggenheim Fellow at the University of London in 1961-1962. He was also executive assistant to the president of the University of Virginia in 1963 and secretary to the Board of Visitors.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The collection contains ca.3,200 items, 10 hollinger boxes, 5 linear feet and is related to the life of archivist emeritus Francis L. Berkeley, Jr. from the University of Virginia Library. Well known for his
scholarly advice as an archivist, and as an executive assistant to former University of Virginia President Edgar F. Shannon, his counsel was sought by historians and authors from around the world. The papers of
Francis L. Berkeley, Jr. (1935-2003) are organized into four series, professional papers, personal papers, U.S. Naval papers and travel
</p>
      <p>The professional papers reflect the scholarly interests of Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., including articles and book reviews that he wrote; the editing of historical works for colleagues such as the Virginius
Dabney manuscript, Mr. Jefferson's University: A History, where he suggested revisions after each chapter; information on his study of the Diary and Letters of Robert "King" Carter of Virginia; reviews of grant
applications for the National Endowment of the Humanities; a Fulbright and Guggenheim scholarship to study Robert "King" Carter and Virginia history in England and Scotland; his development of the Virginia
Colonial Records Project and his leadership with historical societies, publishers, libraries and universities.
</p>
      <p>Berkeley was considered by his colleagues to be a valuable source of knowledge and to have a very direct and honest style for editing manuscripts. He was active in many historical organizations such as the
American Antiquarian Society; American Locust Hill Foundation; American Philosophical Society; American Historical Society; Bear Lake Congress; Massachusetts Historical Society; Association for Preservation of
Virginia Antiquities; Martiau Memorial Association; Pugwash Conference; Virginia State Library; Virginia Historical Society; Lexington Historical Society; Society of American Archivists and the Walpole Society.

place card, invitation, Queen Elizabeth II silver jubilee crown coin and guest list from this day are in the papers. The collection also includes honors that Berkeley received such as membership into the Rotary
Club and honorary membership to the Colonnade Club. He was a member of Phi Delta Kappa and Omicron Delta Kappa. He was also a member of the Raven Society and the Raven award (bust of Poe,1972)that he received is
in the collection.

collection. He worked closely with Colgate S. Darden to establish a memorial garden for Edgar F. Shannon. He also set up a professorship of medicine in the name of Julian Ruffin Beckwith in collaboration with Dr.
Lockhart B. McGuire and a Dumas Malone Traveling Fellowship with the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation.

Walker Cowen with the University Press of Virginia in Charlottesville.

Berkeley, Jr. and Edward Gamble, Jr.). Miscellaneous items include information on the University of Virginia Seal. There is also an original, illustrated Fred O. Seibel cartoon from 1946 signed by Seibel and
