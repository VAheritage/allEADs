      <p>This unit was initially organized as the 129th New York
         Infantry at Lockport, New York, and mustered into federal
         service on August 22, 1862. It was sent to Baltimore,
         Maryland, and posted at Fort Federal Hill. In October 1862 its
         designation was changed to that of heavy artillery as the 8th
         New York Heavy Artillery. After garrison duty in Maryland and
         West Virginia during 1862-1864, the regiment was ordered to
         join the Army of the Potomac in Virginia in May 1864 and
         participated in its campaigns for the remainder of the
         war.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This Civil War pocket diary, 1860, 1864 and 1866, of a
         Union soldier, Private Henry Thomas, Company G, 8th New York
         Heavy Artillery, includes entries during May 15 to June 9,
         1864. During the period covered by the diary the regiment
         served in Virginia during Union General Ulysses S. Grant and
         the Army of the Potomac's spring campaign against the Army of
         Northern Virginia led by Confederate General Robert E. Lee
         which eventually culminated in the Petersburg siege. Near the
         end of the diary are entries for July 15, 1860 and 1866 of
         Thomas's accounts of days he worked; numerous and
         miscellaneous notes, names and financial accounts, in ink or
         pencil, are also present. This item measures 3 x 4 1/2 inches
         and contains ca. 66 pages; many of their contents are faint
         and illegible.</p>
      <p>In brief entries Thomas recounts marching and building
         entrenchments during the Army's march to Richmond, Virginia;
         mentions by name several comrades including those killed or
         wounded; the disastrous attack at Cold Harbor, Virginia (June
         3, 1864), and the rebels' refusal to honor a flag of truce to
         bury the dead (June 6, 1864). Two entries (June 1 and 2) bear
         the incorrect year "1863" which has been corrected to 1864 in
         this guide's typescript.</p>
      <p>The flyleaf bears an inscription: "This Book Belongs to
         Henry Thomas, Batavia, [Genesee] County, New York." He
         identifies himself and his unit on a subsequent page as "Henry
         Thomas/Co. G 8th Artillery/Fourth Brigade/Division of the 2
         [Second] Army Corps Army of the Potomac" followed by an
         undated list: "1 Blanket, 1 Cap, 1 Hat, Two [pair] drawers,
         One Vest, One Dress coat, One [pair] socks." The first major
         entry is a May 15, 1864 "On the Road to Richmond" letter:
         "Jim, I sent you a letter this morning telling you that we had
         got our marching orders well here we go for the Potomac
         Army/Hank." The next page bears an address, "St. James P.
         Thomas, Co. F, 94th Regiment, Annapolis, Maryland," apparently
         Henry Thomas's brother, Sergeant James P. Thomas [1841?-?],
         94th New York Infantry.</p>
      <p>James Thomas was promoted to the rank of First
         Lieutenant on August 12, 1864 and mustered out as a member
         of Company H, 94th New York. Frederick Phisterer,
