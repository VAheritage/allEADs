         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>In this collection are ca. 368 items, 1796-1896, which
         consist of correspondence, business and legal papers, a
         lecture notebook, and miscellaneous papers pertaining to
         several families of 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>. The material relates to the 
         <famname>Johnson</famname>s of 
         <geogname>Petersburg</geogname>, the 
         <famname>Kagy</famname>s of 
         <geogname>New Market</geogname>, and the 
         <famname>Logan</famname>s of 
         <geogname>Salem</geogname>, as well as other families.</p>
         <p>Letters, 1838-January 1849, to 
         <persname>William Ransom Johnson</persname>, are chiefly
         concerned with business matters. Colonel Johnson (1782-1849)
         was a member of the 
         <geogname>North Carolina</geogname>House of Representatives
         from 
         <geogname>Warren County</geogname>, 1807-1808 and 1810-1814;
         the House of Delegates from 
         <geogname>Petersburg</geogname>, 1818-1820 and 
         <geogname>Chesterfield County</geogname>, 1821-1822; the 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>Senate, 1823-1826; and, the 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>House of Representatives,
         1828-1830 and 1833-1837. He married 
         <persname>Mary Evans</persname>in 1803, and their sons
         included 
         <persname>William Ransom Johnson, Jr.</persname>, 
         <persname>J. E. Johnson</persname>, and 
         <persname>Marmaduke Johnson</persname>. Known as "The Napoleon
         of the Turf," he was the leading turfman of America for a
         generation. He established stables at 
         <corpname>Oakland</corpname>, 
         <geogname>Chesterfield County, Virginia</geogname>, beginning
         his career on 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>turf. During 1808-1813, he raced
         "Sir Archy" and "Pacolet," and won $30,000. He was the leader
         and manager for the South in the 
         <corpname>South-North Races</corpname>, 
         <geogname>Washington, D.C.</geogname>in 1823, and also in
         nearly all thirty contests until 1834. He died in 
         <geogname>Mobile, Alabama</geogname>on February 10, 1849, and
         was buried at 
         <corpname>Oakland</corpname>. Letters, February 26, 1845 and
         February 2, 1846, from 
         <persname>William Yates Gholson</persname>(1807-1870), a
         lawyer practicing in 
         <geogname>Cincinnati, Ohio</geogname>, concern a judgment
         against 
         <persname>Mary A. Pugh</persname>and the collection of the
         payment in the 
         <corpname>U. S. District Court</corpname>. There are several
         letters (March 30, April 20, October 4, December 3, 1845; and,
         January 27, March 24, 1846) from 
         <persname>Eggleston Cheatham</persname>, the overseer for 
         <persname>William Ransom Johnson</persname>'s estate in 
         <geogname>Yazoo County, Mississippi</geogname>. These letters
         discuss a dispute between Johnson and his estate manager, 
         <persname>William Berry</persname>, and the latter's refusal
         to accompany Negroes to Johnson in 
         <geogname>New Orleans, Louisiana</geogname>until they make a
         settlement; and, attempts to sell Johnson's property and
         estate in 
         <geogname>Yazoo County</geogname>. One sale contract, a rent
         with the option to buy, fell through because of the
         purchaser's "bad luck with his negroes since he came to this
         neighborhood." After Cheatham's death in December 1848, there
         is a letter, July 23, 1849, from his brother 
         <persname>William Cheaham</persname>to 
         <persname>William Ransom Johnson, Jr.</persname>, concerning
         the difficulty in selling the estate.</p>
         <p>Letters, 1849-1871, to 
         <persname>William Ransom Johnson, Jr.</persname>, are
         concerned with his father's estate as well as his own business
         affairs. There are a few letters from his brothers, 
         <persname>J. E. Johnson</persname>(October 26, 1849; December
         16, 1850; and, February 22, 1851) and 
         <persname>Marmaduke Johnson</persname>(January 28, December
         11, 1850; and, February 26, 1852) mentioning such matters. In
         his letter of October 26, 1849, 
         <persname>J. E. Johnson</persname>writes about their father's
         estate, including the sale of 
         <corpname>Bellegrove</corpname>and a settlement with "Bruce,"
         and asks if there is "any negro woman belonging to the estate
         worth from $200 to $500 who would make a good cook &amp; has
         no family!" In his letter of January 28, 1850, 
         <persname>Marmaduke Johnson</persname>expresses his wish to
         bid for the tract of land bought by their father from 
         <persname>Branch Archer</persname>. There are also letters
         from associates which touch upon various business matters. A
         January 8, 1851 letter from 
         <persname>George Nicholson Johnson</persname>, an attorney,
         discusses problems with General 
         <persname>[John] Pegram</persname>'s estate due to its being
         advertised for sale by 
         <persname>W. R. Johnson, Jr.</persname>without the consent of 
         <persname>Will Carter</persname>. A September 14, 1853 letter
         from 
         <persname>Tazewell Taylor</persname>, Bursar of 
         <corpname>William and Mary College</corpname>, brings up the
         matter of some property for sale. There is an interesting
         letter, January 18, 1852, from 
         <persname>Thomas B. Poindexter</persname>, 
         <geogname>Louisville, Kentucky</geogname>, which discusses a
         racehorse, "Sally Morgan." The writer relates that it was the
         wish of Johnson's father to have the horse sent to 
         <geogname>Boston</geogname>, where she is now a successful
         runner, and also to give the horse to himself. There are two
         letters, December 9, 1868 and February 20, 1869, from 
         <corpname>Meador and Brothers</corpname>, Tobacco Commission
         Merchants, 
         <geogname>Atlanta, Georgia</geogname>, which discuss tobacco
         stock and the forced lowering of prices. Other correspondents
         include attorneys and legislators, such as 
         <persname>John Mercer Patton</persname>(1797-1858), 
         <persname>George Washington Jones</persname>(1806-1884), 
         <persname>Samuel McDowell Moore</persname>(1796-1875), 
         <persname>James A. Seddon</persname>(1815-1880), and 
         <persname>John Minor Botts</persname>(1802-1869). In his March
         31, 1849 letter, Patton discusses the suit of King vs.
         Johnson. In his letters of April 22 and July 17, 1849, Jones
         writes about his financial troubles and inability to pay the
         Johnson estate, his position in office being in jeopardy, and
         his having no property beyond his salary. Moore writes on
         August 3, 1849 concerning a settlement made two years earlier;
         and, Botts writes on June 12, 1850 about an account against
         himself at 
         <corpname>Oakland</corpname>. In his October 14, 1849 letter,
         Seddon responds to Johnson's offer of his mountain estate, and
         mentions his own estate in 
         <geogname>Mecklenburg</geogname>. Letters, August-September
         1850, are concerned with the impending sale of 
         <corpname>Oakland</corpname>and the slaves on September
         25.</p>
         <p>Correspondence of the 
         <famname>Kagy</famname>and related families, 1803-1896, covers
         a wide variety of subjects. In his March 16, 1803 letter to an
         unknown recipient, 
         <persname>William Armistead Burwell</persname>(1780-1821)
         discusses the management of his claim upon "W.C.N." A December
         12, 1865 letter from 
         <persname>Francis J. Smith</persname>to 
         <persname>Joseph B. Gentry</persname>discusses his election to
         the Office of Treasurer and his connection to the 
         <corpname>Richmond and Fredericksburg Rail Road</corpname>.
         There are several personal letters from 
         <persname>Thomas A. Ayre</persname>to his friend 
         <persname>Baxter W. Logan</persname>. In a June 2, 1873 letter
         from 
         <geogname>Norfolk</geogname>, Ayre relates the effect of the
         Civil War on his family, and the loss of his father's wealth
         which he had in the form of property such as slaves. A letter,
         April 2, 1874, from 
         <persname>J. B. Jackson</persname>in 
         <geogname>Washington, D.C.</geogname>to 
         <persname>Baxter W. Logan</persname>, describes a visit to the
         Capitol where he heard Senator 
         <persname>[Allen Granberry] Thurman</persname>of Ohio,
         mentions a few other individuals being there from the Indian
         Nation, refers to seeing Vice-President 
         <persname>[Henry] Wilson</persname>and Senator 
         <persname>[James Winright] Flanagan</persname>, and also
         mentions a stop at the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>. Another
         interesting letter, May 26, 1875, from 
         <corpname>Terrell and Walthall</corpname>to 
         <persname>J. P. M. Sanders</persname>, describes an enclosed
         rough draft of a four passenger rockaway. Letters of May 1890
         are concerned with the unveiling of the Lee Monument in 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>.</p>
         <p>Business and legal papers, 1796-1875, relate to various
         Virginia families. There are papers relative to the estates of
         <persname>Edwin Burwell</persname>(ca. 1798-1800), 
         <persname>Joseph Selden</persname>(ca. 1802-1804), 
         <persname>James W. Pegram</persname>(ca. 1844-1845), and 
         <persname>William Ransom Johnson</persname>(ca. 1845-1850);
         and, the 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>firm of
