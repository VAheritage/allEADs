            <p>[Mentions a letter from Lossing which didn't reach
                  him. Expresses his regret at how little he has to
                  show for 53 years of life. Mentions the loss of first
                  his means of living and now his health (to "breakbone
                  fever" [dengue]). Discusses the false belief that 
                  <geogname>Italy</geogname>'s climate is beneficial to
                  invalids. Mentions the prevalence of both
                  intermittent fever and influenza. Describes in depth
                  the houses and humidity. Speaks of his wife 
                  <persname>Elizabeth Eaton Jones Redfield</persname>'s
                  pulmonary problems. Says there is much to interest
                  the traveller, but that a knowledge of the Italian
                  language and history, as well as Greek history, is
                  essential. Gives a brief history of 
                  <geogname>Otraunto</geogname>, including its sacking
                  by the Turks in 1480. Mentions his own lack of
                  knowledge of the area and his desire to write its
                  history. Gives a colorful description of the olive
                  trees. Speaks of the "imbecility" ruling in the 
                  <geogname>United States</geogname>and expresses his
                  wish to have 
                  <persname>Thomas Jonathan (Stonewall)
                  Jackson</persname>commanding the North instead of 
                  <persname>Abraham Lincoln</persname>, his Cabinet and
                  "half of his biggest generals." Compares the Battle
                  of 
                  <geogname>Fredericksburg</geogname>(12/13 and 12/14)
                  to the Battle at 
                  <geogname>Richmond</geogname>and the Bull Run
                  Campaign. Begs Lossing to stop overworking himself
                  and says his histories will benefit from his
                  traveling to 
                  <geogname>Europe</geogname>now and writing later.
                  Expresses pleasure that Archie is doing well and
                  sends his and his wife's regards to Archie and his
                  family. Mentions: Early Christians,

            <p>[Thanks Coffin for his letters and his interest in
                  Lossing's autographs. Says he doesn't mean to sell
                  them singly, but would be willing to sell the letter
                  about which Coffin wrote. Asks for prices brought by
                  various autographed letters at the Burnham Sale. Says
                  he and Dr. Fogg have corresponded for twenty years.
                  Says Fogg supplied one of the drawings engraved in
                  his

                  supplied Fogg and his intention to write Fogg about
                  his own collection. Thanks Coffin for suggestions
                  concerning Fogg and the arrangement of annotations of
                  Lossing's autographs. Expresses a desire to see the
                  letters Coffin purchased at the sale. Speaks of much
                  time spent cataloguing his own autographs. Thanks
                  Coffin forallowing him to keep his Poore ? catalogue.
