      <abstract label="Abstract">Union Soldier Richard F. Bohn
         writes from the battlefields of Virginia, primarily from a
         camp near Petersburg, to his parents and sister. Bohn
         describes his journey to the front; construction of forts and
         rifle pits at Petersburg; camp life; picket duty; several
         engagements including Fort Stedman and the fall of Petersburg
         and Richmond. There are references to the election of 1864;
         black soldiers; the drunkeness of Captain Franklin Schmehl;
         the hanging of two deserteres; and his colonel Joseph Ard
         Matthews. The collection also contains an 1862 letter from
         Ella Corbin to her brother Miner H. Corbin of the 22nd
         Connecticut; and an 1863 letter from William Heafer of the
         167th Pennsylvania to Elbina F. Bohn.</abstract>

         Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, while stationed at the
         Petersburg front in Virginia, to his parents, sister and

         Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, to an unidentified
         correspondent, Feburary 14, 1863.</p>
      <p>Bohn's letters, written mostly from various camps and towns
         in Virginia (Suffolk, Petersburg, Dutch Gap and Burkeville),
         discusses his impressions of the war, his comrades and
         commanding officers, personal and public incidents, camp news,
         battle and march rumors, and family news. He lists the names
         of his parents, siblings and relatives in several letters
         (October 16, 1864, January 15 and April 11, 1865). Military
         life and activities described include the transport of Bohn's
         regiment to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Camp Curtin, Baltimore
         and Washington, D.C. (September 6, 1864), camp life during the
         Petersburg siege, including construction of forts and rifle
         pits (October 7 and 16, 1864), night drills (October 11,
         1864), a dinner of soup and hardtack, bread loaves issued to
         soldiers (October 16, 1864), winter quarters (October 26,
         1864), a graphic description of the capture and butchering of
         cattle (1864), the execution of two deserters of the 187th New
         York Infantry who had joined the Confederate army (December
         16, 1864), soldiers' and officers' drunkenness (October 26 and
         October ? 1864), soldiers' support of Democratic presidential
         candidate General George B. McClellan (October 16 and 26 and
         ante November 8, 1864), the capture of various soldiers
         (October 30, November 24, 1864), the capture of stationery and
         tobacco from dead rebel soldiers (April 1, 1865), the dramatic
         escape of a Union soldier from Confederate soldiers (October
         30, 1864), and Bohn's enjoyment of soldiering and his
         five-year reenlistment (February 15, 1865). Another of his
         letters, October 30, 1864, is written on U. S. Christian
         Commission stationery.</p>
      <p>Battles and engagements described include: Burgess
         Mill/Boydton Plank Road (October 30, 1864), Fort Stedman
         (April 1, 1865), and the capture of Petersburg and Richmond
         (April 11, 1865).</p>
      <p>Among the soldiers and officers of the 205th Pennsylvania
         mentioned or referred by name: Captain Richard Boone (October
         16 and ante November 8, 1864), Privates Elias D. Hoch, John H.
         Roth and Darling Meadler (April 11, 1865), Colonel Joseph Ard
         Matthews (March 4, 1865), First Lieutenant David B. Roberts
         and Second Lieutenant Irwin S. Phillips (April 11, 1865),
         Captain Franklin Schmehl (October 26 and October ?, 1864), and
         Colonel William F. Walters (October ?, 1864); Bohn also
         reports the capture of Colonel [Tobias Kauffman], 209th
         Pennsylvania Infantry (November 24, 1864).</p>
      <p>Regiments other than the 205th Pennsylvania mentioned in
         these letters include: the 22nd Connecticut Infantry Regiment
         (November 12, 1862), the Ulster Guards, 20th Regiment New York

         Bohn's obtaining lodging in a black family's shanty after
         becoming lost (October 16, 1864), and the presence of black
         soldiers and arrest of a black Union soldier for killing a
         Confederate soldier (November 24, 1864).</p>
      <p>A few letters are written by or refer to members of the
         Heafer family (Bohn's in-laws): William Heafer, writing from
         Suffolk, Virginia, includes a love poem to Elbina F. Bohn
         (February 14, 1863), William's visit with the 205th
         Pennsylvania (October 16, 1864) and Richard Bohn's mention of
         him to his sister Elbina (1864), and passing mention of Jacob
         Heafer (November 24, 1864).</p>
