      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of eight letters chiefly from
         members of the Lybrook family, 1831-1863, to Henley C.
         Lybrook, Cassopolis, Cass County, Michigan. Correspondents
         include Philip Lybrook, Giles County, Virginia; D.W. Sleeth,
         McWhorter's Mill, Lewis County, [West] Virginia; [D. Wall, Jr.
         ?], Princeton, Mercer County, [West] Virginia; George R.
         Lybrook, Mechanicsburg, Virginia; and Samuel [Marr?], Chicago,
         Illinois.</p>
      <p>Philip Lybrook writes to his brother about the family and
         his business, mentioning the recent Virginia Convention held
         1829-1830, and the new constitution which resulted (1831 Apr
         13). He also mentions several debts that [Josiah?] Lumpkins
         still owed when he left Giles County for Michigan, discusses
         the trial of David Lucas who was acquitted, the lawsuit
         between William B. Hutchison and William Williams before Judge
         Snidow over a sow and three shoats, and his sister, Sally, who
         is still staying at Pleasant Webb's since a hospital would be
         very expensive (1842 Jan 22).</p>
      <p>In a third letter, Philip updates his brother about his
         scattered family and their whereabouts, with Johnston Lybrook
         in California for the past twenty months or more, Andrew Murry
         Lybrook in college and graduating in 1852, Eliza [Vawter?] and
         Elinor living in Monroe County, [West] Virginia, George R.
         Lybrook living at Mechanicsburg and working as a physician,
         Lavinia still at Blacksburg, John has gone to Salem, North
         Carolina with Margaret Ann to go to school, and only John,
         Samuel E., William S. Lybrook, and their mother are still at
         home with him. They need financial assistance to take care of
         sister Sally at home since her mental condition has
         deteriorated and they do not want to put her in a lunatic
         asylum. Philip discusses the problems in raising a large
         family, the Virginia Constitutional Convention called last
         winter, and the new members elected traveling to the capital
         (1852 Jan 10).</p>
      <p>D.W. Sleeth, apparently the husband of Nancy Lybrook,
         describes in detail his misadventures with the justice system
         of Greenbrier County at the hands of G.W. Singleton,
         prosecuting attorney for the U.S. War Department, over pension
         claims, and his wife Nancy being upset in not being told of
         the death of her father, John Lybrook (1839 Feb 24). Later
         Sleeth writes about the prospects for his own small business
         interests in Ritchie County and Gilmer County, [West]
         Virginia, and discusses the medical properties of the water at
         Coopers Well or Buena Vista and Blue Sulphur Springs (1850 Sep
         1).</p>
      <p>[D. Wall, Jr.?] congratulates his friend upon his marriage
         and mentions that David Lucas is rumored to have killed a
         peddler whose body has just been found (1842 Apr 4).</p>
      <p>George R. Lybrook explains to his uncle why he has stayed
         to practice medicine in Mechanicsburg, Virginia, instead of
         coming to Michigan (1845 Jul 25).</p>
      <p>Samuel [Marr?], who lives in Chicago, discusses the Lybrook
         family's involvement in the Civil War in his letter, relating
         that one of Brother John's sons had been a prisoner at Camp
         Douglas, south of Chicago, Illinois, for two months after
         being taken at Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and was leaving for
         City Point, Virginia, after his release to probably rejoin
         R.E. Lee's army. Brother John had five sons in the Rebel army
         and had been living in exile in Giles County, probably staying
         with Philip, ever since [John Buchanan] Floyd's Army retreated
         from Fayetteville, Fayette County, [West] Virginia. William
         Lybrook was exchanged and went to Lynchburg, Virginia, where
         he was injured by falling off a flight of stairs. Murry
         Lybrook had been wounded and Aunt Lybrook and Samuel alone
         remained at home. The whole area was deserted, including the
         county seat of Fayetteville, and their farm destroyed (1863
         Apr 14).</p>
