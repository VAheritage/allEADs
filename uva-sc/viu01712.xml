         She was also a contributor to several magazines, including 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Christian Science Monitor, Harper's,

      <p>Plath committed suicide on February 11, 1963, in London,
         England. She was already becoming a legend at the time of her
         death. She had consistently courted death throughout her life.
         Critics say that in Ariel Plath made poetry and death
         inseparable, and that the poems read as though they were
         written posthumously. She was influenced by such writers as D.
         H. Lawrence, James Joyce, Dostoevski, Virginia Woolf, Henry
         James, Theodore Roethke, Emily Dickinson, and later by Robert
         Lowell and Anne Sexton. She has been linked with the latter as
         a member of the so-called confessional school of poetry. [See
         online

         information on the life and works of Sylvia Plath].</p>
      <p>Anne (Harvey) Sexton, born November 9, 1928, in Newton,
         Massachusetts, began her career as a fashion model, 1950-1951,
         and later went into the education field, becoming a teacher at
         Wayland High School, Wayland, Massachusetts, 1967-1968;
         lecturer in creative writing, 1970-1971, and professor of
         creative writing, 1972-1974, at Boston University; scholar,
         Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, 1961-1963; and,
         Crenshaw Professor of Literature, Colgate University, 1972.
         She also gave numerous poetry readings at colleges and
         universities. She was a member of the Poetry Society of
         America, Royal Society of Literature, New England Poetry Club,
