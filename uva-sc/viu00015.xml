        <p>The papers of 
             Leonidas Baugh were given to the
            Library by Miss 
             Ethel Baugh of 
             Abingdon, Virginia, in <date era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1936.</date></p>

      <head>SCOPE AND CONTENT</head>
      <p>The papers of 
          Leonidas Baugh, editor of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Abingdon Democrat,</title>and a local
         businessman in 
          Abingdon, Virginia, and of other 
          Washington County families, consist of 544
         items (1 Hollinger box; .33 linear shelf feet), 1819-1930, and
         contain correspondence, financial and legal papers, ledgers,
         genealogical material concerning the 
         Crawford family, unidentified photographs,
         political papers, printed material, and school records.</p>
      <p> Leonidas Baugh served as editor of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Abingdon Democrat</title>from
         1849-1853, although the paper continued to be published until
         1861. 
          Leonidas Baugh became postmaster at 
          Abingdon in 1853, and also eventually
         became the Deputy Clerk of 
          Washington County Court. Perhaps because
         of his work in the 
          Washington County Court, 
          Leonidas Baugh's papers contain many
         financial and legal papers not directly related to himself. 
          Leonidas Baugh also entered a tanning and
         harness-making partnership in 1847 which lasted for seven
         years.</p>
      <p>Topics of interest in the correspondence include the
         following: 
          Isaac B. Dunn and the controversy over the
         type of internal improvement most beneficial to 
          Southwest Virginia, the 
          James River and 
          Kanawha Canal Company, a new road or the 
          Southwest Virginia Railroad (1849 December 30);
         a friend writing from the gold fields of 
          Sacramento, California (1849 August 25); a
         description of Governor 
          Joseph Johnson and criticism for the
         Whigs' resolution to receive 
          Virginia's quota of the land money to be
         deposited with the literary fund for the benefit of indigent
         children of the Commonwealth proposed by 
          [J.D.] Imboden (1851 February 2); a request
         that 
          Leonidas Baugh print a reader's response
         to Holmes, the editor of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Southwestern Advocate</title>, and his
         attack upon the 
          Jeffersonville Historical Society (1851
         December 23); the difficulties of doing business during the Civil
         War (1862 May 16; and 1863 March 30); a description of a trip to
          Alaska and employment there in the 
          Alaska Native School, 
          Medical and Reindeer Service of the Bureau of
         Education, 
          Department of the Interior (1925 February 6);
         and the purchase of iron (n.d.).</p>
      <p>Beginning in 1878, much of 
          Leonidas Baugh's correspondence was
         concerned with the politics of 
          Virginia, 
          Washington County, and 
          Abingdon. These include: 
          Leonidas Baugh's accusation that 
          Isaac Chapman Fowler, editor of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Bristol News</title>, had a secret
         understanding with the Funders, and had consequently voted
         against Col. 
          Abram Fulkerson (Readjuster) on the
         Bocock-Fowler Bill, an association which he denied by
         reputiating the Funder stance on free schools, asylum money,
         and the total payment of state debt (1878 September 30); 
          Abram Fulkerson's discussion of the
         defeat of the Funders on the 
          Virginia debt question, the wise course
         for bondholders to follow, the 
          Virginia Legislature elections of 1880 and
         their significance, the "turncoat" 
          Isaac Chapman Fowler of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Bristol News</title>, and the black
         vote, "The abuse the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">[Richmond] Dispatch</title>and other
         Funder papers are heaping on the Negro, will make the Negro
         members stick the closer to us. Our policy should be to deal
         with kindly and fairly" (1879 November 11); the request of 
          Fayette McMullin (who ran as a
         Conservative-Independent-Greenbacker and advocate of federal
         construction of the 
          Cumberland Gap railroad) for 
          Leonidas Baugh's help in beating General 
          William Mahone in the election for 
          United States Senator (1879 December 6); a
         discussion by 
          A. Fulkerson of the future of the 
          Readjuster Party of Virginia and the debt
         bill (the Riddleberger Act) which fixed the amount of 
          Virginia state debt at about $21,000,000,
         for which new bonds were issued bearing three per cent
         interest (1880 February 12); and the reference of 
          F[rank] Blair to the 
          John E. Massy matter (1882 February 8).</p>
      <p>Other political correspondence includes: the argument of 
          Isaac Chapman Fowler that for the Funders
         to destroy the Readjuster Party they must attack 
          William Mahone, the reference to 
          John E. Massey as a traitor to the party
         who joined with the Funders to overthrow 
          William Mahone and the "Boss" of the "Big
         Four" ( 
          S.H. Newberry, 
          Peyton G. Hale, 
          B.F. Williams, and 
          A.M. Lybrook ), and that the Readjusters
         would be "nincompoops" not to support the 
          Chester A. Arthur Administration (1882 April
         28); reports on 
          John E. Massey's political chances in the
          Love Mill, Washington County area where he
         will attract only Funder votes, and a promise to take several
         good Readjusters to the 
          Marion Convention (1882 August 7); reports
         from 
          Scott County that no Readjuster will vote
         for 
          John E. Massey in the elections (1882 August
         11); the political news from 
          Wise County and 
          Scott County (1882 October 26); a disagreement
         with 
          A. Fulkerson over his assessment of his
         chances to defeat 
          Henry Bowen for election to Congress in 
          Scott County (1882 November 3); the vote in 
          Tazewell County and Scott County (1882 November 7); the vote in 
          Buchanan County (1882 November 8) and the vote
         in 
          Montgomery County (November 11); the office of
         postmaster in [ 
          Abingdon ] and 
          Isaac Chapman Fowler's obligation to
         support 
          Rees B. Edmondson in return for a favor he
         did for him (1883 February 14); and details of local politics and
         the desire to beat the 
          A. Fulkerson ring in the elections (1883
         May 7).</p>
      <p>Some of the political correspondents include 
          Abram Fulkerson (1834-1902) September 19,
         1878, November 11, 1879, and February 12, 1880; 
          Fayette McMullin (? -1881) December 6,
         1879; 
          Frank Blair, February 8, 1882; and 
          Isaac Chapman Fowler (1831-?) September
         30, 1878; April 28, 1882; February 14, 1883; and May 7
         1883.</p>
      <p>The financial and legal papers contain accounts, articles
         of agreement, papers concerning the settlement of various
         estates, promissory notes, bills, and bonds. Much of the early
         material pertains to 
          James C. Simpson or his partnership with 
          William Simpson. Individual topics
         include: salt production at 
          Saltville (1824); nail and iron production
         (1837 November; 1839 April, April 13, May 17, June 12, 19, 20); a bank note from the 
          Farmers Bank of Virginia (1841 September 5); the
         hiring out of blacks (1841 March 20); the co-partnership of 
          Lewellin C. Newland and 
          Leonidas Baugh for the purpose of carrying
         on the tanning and harness-making business in 
          Abingdon for seven years (1847 June 19);
         the Printing Office account with 
          Leonidas Baugh re the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Abingdon Democrat</title>[1861 ?]; a
         horsetrading partnership (1880 June); the value of real estate
         in the town of 
          Abingdon (1880); a black property owner in
          Washington County (1883 April 28); and a
         copy of the U.S. military record of a black man, 
          Henderson Wells, who enlisted at 
          Cleveland, Ohio, on November 23, 1882 in 
          Company I, Tenth Regiment of Cavalry and
         was discharged on disability (1883 June 18).</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous papers contains a newspaper subscriber list,
         perhaps of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Abingdon Democrat</title>(n.d.)</p>
      <p>Printed political papers include a broadside re the
         campaign of 
          Daniel Trigg (1877); a Readjuster
         broadside re the Funders and black voters (ca. 1879); and a
         Readjuster broadside re schools (ca. 1882). Speeches include
         those by the 
          Republican Executive Committee to the
         Voters of the 
          9th Congressional District (1880), the
         plan of organization adopted by the 
          State Executive Committee of the Democratic
         Party (n.d.), 
          Auburn L. Pridemore (1879 February 16), 
          Frank G. Ruffin (1883 September 19), and 
          Justin S. Morrill (1884 April 16).</p>
      <p>Political tickets include: the National Greenback ticket
         [188O], the Readjuster and Democratic tickets for 
          Washington County (1883 May 24), and the
         Democratic ticket of 
          John E. Massey and 
          Abram Fulkerson (1882). Also present is a
         list of voters in 
          Washington County with insolvent
         capitation and property taxes (1881).</p>
      <p>The election returns among the political papers include:

          Hanover Counties (1879).</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous political papers contain a memorandum and
         various drafts of a petition to the 
          General Assembly of Virginia from the
         citizens of 
          Abingdon and 
          Washington Counties concerning the
         controversy over the charter for the 
          Russell Old Court House and 
          Abingdon Turnpike Company for the
         construction of a graded road across 
          Washington County from near "Mocks Mill"
         to the line of 
          Russell County near 
          Little Moccasin Gap (n.d.); a notice for 
          Leonidas Baugh's paper of a Union meeting
         to be held by the students of 
          Emory and Henry College in protest of
         action taken by 
          University of Virginia students to promote
         a "Disunion Feast" (n.d.) and an editorial on whether 
          William Mahone struck a deal with the
