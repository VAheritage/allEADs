      <p>There is also one folder of letters between Mrs. R.G.H.
         Kean, ( 
         Adelaide Navarro de Maret Prescott) and
         Dr. 
         J. Randolph Kean, from the time 
         J. Randolph Keanwas teaching school in 
         Onancock, Virginiain 1880 until 1922.
         There are also occasional letters from Addie to Randolph in
         the letters from 
         R.G.H. Keanto his son described
         above.</p>
      <p>There are four folders of letters from Dr. 
         J. Randolph Keanto his wife, 
         Louise Hurlburt Young Kean(1877-1915),
         beginning in 1898 after the declaration of war on 
         Spainand continuing during his absences
         until shortly before her death in 1915. The first group of
         letters, in 1898, were written from 
         Ft. Ethan Allen, Essex Junction, Vermont;
         Lynchburg, Virginia, where 
         J. Randolph Keanattended his father in
         his last illness, May 16-June 13; and describing his life and
         work at 
         Camp Cuba Libre, Jacksonville, Florida,
         Headquarters and Field Hospital, 2nd Division, 7th Army Corps,
         June 27-September 5, 1898. For more details of this period,
         1898-1900, see his diary, volume number 4. The letters in 1900
         were written while 
         J. Randolph Keanwas stationed in 
         Quemados, Cuba, the Headquarters
         Department of the Province of 
         Havanaand 
         Pinar Del Rio, Chief Surgeon's Office,
         mentioning yellow fever cases and Dr. 
         W. C. Gorgas. When the letters were
         written in 1902, Kean was chiefly in 
         Washington, D.C.but made visits to 
         Camp G.H. Thomas, Lytle, Georgia, and
         elsewhere, on Army business, while his wife Louise was
         visiting at 
         Edgehilland the 
         University of Virginia. The last two
         folders contain Kean's correspondence to his wife in
         1912-1913, on War Department, Office of the Surgeon General
         stationery, describing a tour of inspection in the South, a
         period covered in volumes 9 &amp; 10 of his diaries.</p>

         letters from 
         J. Randolph Keanto and from his
         mother-in-law (two folders) and 
         Louise H. Young Keanto her mother (12
         folders), 
         Louise Hurlburt Young, beginning with the
         marriage of Randolph and Louise in 1894. These letters
         describe the Army surgeon career and travels of 
         J. Randolph Keanfrom his wife's
         perspective, especially their experiences in 
         Cuba.</p>
      <p>Another group of letters is comprised of correspondence
         between 
         J. Randolph Kean and his son, 
         Robert Hill Kean(1900 -?) during the
         Great War (3 folders), while Kean was serving with the 
         American Expeditionary Forces,
         Headquarters, U.S. Army Ambulance Service, chiefly in 
         Tours, France, and Robert was attending 
         Woodberry Forest School, and 1946-1950
         (10 folders). There is also a single folder of letters from 
         Robert Keanto his father, 1917-1918, and
         1947. Kean particularly describes his work with the Services
         of Supply in 1918 when censorship was relaxed for those
         serving away from the Advance Section, also mentioning his
         promotion to Brigadier General, Medical Corps. He also
         mentions the Jefferson's Day Centennial Celebration by the 
         University of Virginia Overseas Alumni on
         April 12 &amp; 13, 1919; his marriage to 
         Cornelia B. Knox(1919 Apr 1, 22; May 2,
         26); and his receipt of the Legion of Honor from the French
         government (Apr 13).</p>
      <p>There are also four folders of condolence letters and
         telegrams to 
         J. Randolph Keanupon the death of his
         first wife, 
         Louise H. Young, 1915-1916 from friends
         and associates. Other folders of correspondence include one of
