      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p><persname>Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve</persname>(1831-1924),
         who was probably America's greatest classical scholar, was
         born in Charleston, South Carolina on October 23, 1831. He was
         the second of seven children of Benjamin Gildersleeve
         (1791-1875), a prominent Presbyterian minister, and Emma
         Louisa Lanneau (1805-59). His early education was provided by
         his father and was steeped in the study of Latin, Greek, and
         the classics. He began his formal schooling at the College of
         Charleston and later enrolled at Princeton from where, in 1849
         at age 17, he graduated fourth in a class of seventy-nine.</p>
      <p>In 1850, Gildersleeve traveled to Germany to pursue more
         intensive classical studies in Berlin, Bonn, and at Gottingen
         University from which he received a Ph.D. (1853). Returning
         home to Richmond, he engaged in several literary and
         journalistic activities until his election in 1856 to a
         professorship at the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>where he would
         spend the next twenty years teaching Greek and Latin. During
         this period, while convalescing from a Civil War battle wound,
         he met and later married Elizabeth Fisher Colston (1846-1930);
         they raised two children, Raleigh Colston (1869-1944) and Emma
         Louise (1872-1954).</p>
      <p>In 1875, Gildersleeve left pastoral Charlottesville for
         Baltimore to serve as the first faculty appointment and Greek
         chair at the newly established Johns Hopkins University.
         During a 40 year tenure at Hopkins, he achieved worldwide
         academic distinction as a classical scholar, renown as a
         master of Greek syntax, and recognition as a major contributor
         to the "university" system in American education. He founded
         the 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">American Journal of Philology</title></bibref>in 1880 and raised it to international influence by
         the force of his written contributions and editorship; he was
         elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters and
         later to the American Academy of Arts and Letters; he served
         twice as president of the American Philological Association;
         and, in 1905, was the first American to receive a doctorate of
         letters from both Oxford and Cambridge Universities.</p>
      <p>Gildersleeve continued in academic work until his
         retirement in 1915 at age 83. He died on January 9, 1924 and
         is buried in University Cemetery in Charlottesville,
         Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection contains ca. 860 items (2.5 shelf feet) and
         consists primarily of a variety of keepsakes and memorabilia
         that reflect on the life and work of Gildersleeve and that
         appear to have been personally gathered and saved by him and
         by 
         <persname normal="Elizabeth Colston Gildersleeve">
         Elizabeth</persname>and, in later years, by his daughter, 
         <persname normal="Emma Gildersleeve Lane">Emma</persname>(Mrs.
         Gardiner M. Lane) and his granddaughter, 
         <persname>Katharine Lane Weems</persname>. The scattered
         assortment of letters, notes, diaries, books, reprints,
         newsclips, published articles, obituaries, photographs,
         diplomas, mementoes, and other memorabilia that make up the
         collection have been arranged in four groupings:</p>
      <p><emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph>--A large portion
         of the correspondence consists of personal letters and poetic
         notes that Gildersleeve wrote to his wife over the span of
         their married life. The remaining correspondence includes a
         handful of letters to him from friends and colleagues and a
         miscellaneous group of letters that are addressed to other
         family members. Noteworthy are: an 1866 
         <persname>Robert E. Lee</persname>autographed letter inviting
         Gildersleeve and Elizabeth to be his house guests at 
         <geogname>Lexington, Virginia</geogname>(see: Correspondent
         Letters--to 
         <persname>Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve</persname>); a letter
         written in cuneiform script by JHU Professor 
         <persname>Paul Haupt</persname>honoring Gildersleeve on his
         70th birthday (see: Correspondent Letters--to 
         <persname>Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve</persname>); several
         colleague letters that are affixed, together with some of his
         published articles, in an annotated album that Gildersleeve
         has entitled "Sargasso--On Weeds from the Atlantic" (see:
         Diaries/Notebooks-- 
         <persname>Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve</persname>annotated
         album); and two groups of acknowledgement letters (26 items
         and 67 items respectively) from recipients of the publication:
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Selections from the Brief Mention of Basil Lanneau
            Gildersleeve</title></bibref>which was distributed originally in the 1930s by
         Gildersleeve's daughter to some of his former colleagues,
         friends, and pupils (see: Correspondent Letters --to other
         family members) and then again in the 1960s by his
         granddaughter to university and college libraries throughout
         the world (see: Correspondent Letters --Katharine L.
         Weems).</p>
      <p><emph render="italic">Writings</emph>--Included in this group
         are several of Gildersleeve's published articles contained in
         periodicals that were very likely part of his private
         collection and that bear his autograph and marginalia. The
         unpublished papers, together with the diaries and notebooks
         that make up the balance of this group, are an accumulation of
         bits and pieces of written material, most of which appear to
         be in Gildersleeve's hand. Those that are not, along with some
         typewritten drafts, are of unknown authorship. Although not
         voluminous, the items in this group represent a vivid sampling
         of Gildersleeve's writing style over a period of some 75
         years. Included are poems he wrote in 1848 as a 16 year old
         student, travel notes he made during his first and only trip
         to Greece in 1896, and poetry he composed for his wife in
         1923, shortly before his death.</p>
      <p><emph render="italic">Commentary</emph>--The collection of
         newspaper and published articles gives an indication of the
         esteem in which Gildersleeve was held by scholars and
         commentators from around the world.</p>
      <p><emph render="italic">Miscellaneous</emph>--Most of the
         material in this group consists of keepsake items and
         mementoes that may have held special meaning for Gildersleeve
         as well as for his wife, daughter and granddaughter. Of
         special note among Gildersleeve's personal keepsakes are
         ancient Greek coins from the period ca. 400-336 B.C. and his
         grandfather Finch's Continental Army Commission that bears a
         John Jay autograph. Also included in this group are a
         collection of family photographs and some miscellaneous
         genealogical material relating to the Gildersleeve and Colston
         family lineage. Oversized material (30 items) consisting of
         several large photographic prints, diplomas, academic
         certificates, and a blueprint drawing have been relocated to
         an oversized storage box.</p>
