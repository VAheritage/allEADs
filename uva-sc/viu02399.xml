      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Over the years, the company has been characterized by
         steady growth from the construction of private residences in
         Charlottesville and surrounding areas to commercial,
         industrial and institutional building throughout the state of
         Virginia. Prior to 1950, the company's main emphasis was on
         building custom homes for individuals. In the late 1950's, the
         company expanded from building private residences to include
         some commercial construction. The firm began to concentrate
         almost exclusively on commercial contracts in the 1960's. In
         the 1970's, the company began to compete for institutional and
         industrial contracts as well. Today, R.E. Lee and Sons has
         branch offices in Hampton and Fairfax, Virginia, and employs
         over 300 people. The company celebrated its 50th anniversary
         in 1989.</p>
      <p>The third generation representative of this family owned
         business, Robert Erwin Lee, Jr. (Robin) is now treasurer of
         the company. Robin Lee (1940- ) graduated from the University
         of Virginia's Darden School of Business in 1964 with a
         Master's degree in Business Administration.</p>
      <p>R.E. Lee and Sons has been involved with many important
         projects in the area in addition to those included in this
         collection. In 1976, the company renovated the interior of the
         Rotunda and won the "Build America Award" for most outstanding
         construction project in the U.S. by the Association of General
         Contractors and Motorola Corporation. Projects at the
         University of Virginia include Clemons Library, the Law
         School, the Graduate School of Business, the Drama Building,
         the Schools of Education, Engineering and Nursing, Wilson
         Hall, Newcomb Hall, Thornton Hall and Monroe Hall as well as
         Lambeth, Copeley and Married Student Housing projects and the
         Scott Stadium expansion.</p>
      <p>In addition, R.E. Lee and Sons is responsible for many of
         the hotels, shopping centers, schools, health care facilities
         and other commercial buildings in the Charlottesville area as
         well as in Richmond, Alexandria, Fairfax, Newport News,
         Fredricksburg, Williamsburg and Roanoke, and elsewhere in the
         state.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 10,000 items (24 Hollinger
         boxes, ca. 10 linear shelf feet), 1935-1962, the business
         papers of R.E. Lee and Son, Inc., one of the oldest
         construction firms in Virginia which originated in
         Charlottesville. The business was co-founded in 1939 by Robert
         Edward Lee, a mechanical engineer, and his son, Robert Erwin
         Lee. The Lees moved to Charlottesville in 1911. The younger
         Lee (1908-1978) attended Charlottesville High School and
         graduated from the University of Virginia School of
         Engineering in 1929 with a B.S. in civil engineering. He
         served as a major in the army corps of engineers in World War
         II, 1943-1945.</p>
      <p>The papers in 7615 (1 box) consist primarily of
         correspondence between Lee and Fiske Kimball of Pennsylvania
         concerning the construction of his house, Bellevue, on Shack
         Mountain.</p>
      <p>#7615-a (7 boxes) concerns the construction of several
         private residences between 1938 and 1962 in the
         Charlottesville area. Papers concerning these projects
         consists of bid solicitations, cost estimates, monthly
         accounts, some floor plans and building sketches and
         correspondence with sub-contractors such as the Virginia
         Steele Co. and Charlottesville Lumber Co. These papers are an
         excellent guide to the planning and construction of high
         quality homes.</p>
      <p>Also in the collection are papers pertaining to the
         restoration and maintenance of some of the best known
         historical homes in Virginia including Monticello, Morven, Mt.
         Vernon and Shadwell.</p>
      <p>R. E. Lee was contracted by the Thomas Jefferson Memorial
         Foundation to handle the general maintainance and repairs of
         Monticello, designed and built by Thomas Jefferson. The house
         is one of the finest examples of neo-classical architecture in
         the country. R.E. Lee, mainly between 1938 and 1960, was
         responsible for the restoration of the Northwest wing of
         Monticello and surrounding buildings as well as the
         construction of an entrance building in 1952 and the gate
         house, completed in 1953. The firm was also responsible for
         periodic painting of the residence. The papers in this
         collection consist of correspondence with Milton L. Grigg, a
         Charlottesville architect, and the Thomas Jefferson Memorial
         Foundation, among others, and monthly accounts and invoices
         for purchases.</p>
      <p>Morven was originally constructed in Albemarle County
         between 1808 and 1818 by its first two owners,
         ex-Revolutionary War colonel William Short and David
         Higgenbotham. Since its construction the property has changed
         hands many times. It was bought by Charles A. Stone of New
         York City ca. 1926, who undertook complete restoration of the
         property. Lee was contracted by Stone Farm Associates
         (ca.1939) to construct a swimming pool and make major
         alterations on the existing kitchen as well as other minor
         repairs and alterations during the twenty years he was in
         their employment.</p>
      <p>The home and final resting place of George Washington, Mt.
         Vernon, located in Fairfax County on the banks of the Potomac,
         is considered by some to be the most notable mansion in the
         state. Lee was contracted by the Mt. Vernon Ladies'
         Association for approximately three years (1936-1939), during
         which time he completed the restoration of the stable, the
         George Washington Barn and the tomb of George Washington, as
         well as the ice and smoke houses. The company also
         reconstructed the power house and shops and built the
         superintendent's house. Some of the correspondence in these
         papers is with Ross Structural Iron Works of Richmond and the
         Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.</p>
      <p>Lee undertook the total reconstruction of Shadwell, also
         known as the Peter Jefferson House, in 1958. The modest
         farmhouse, located three miles east of Charlottesville, was
         the birthplace of Thomas Jefferson and his home for much of
         his young life. The house burned down in 1770, but Peter
         Jefferson's sketches and notes survived and were used in the
         reconstruction. An intensive study of the site was conducted
         in 1955 by archeologist Roland W. Robbins. The project was
         sponsored by the Jefferson Birthplace Memorial Park
         Commission. Lee's papers concerning the project consist of
         cost estimates, materials lists, bids from subcontractors,
         running accounts and correspondence with Colonial Williamsburg
         regarding specially-made hardware orders.</p>
      <p>The 7615-b series (16 boxes) contains papers concerning the
         construction of many private residences, churches, schools,
         businesses and banks in the Charlottesville and surrounding
         areas. Projects at the University of Virginia include work on
         Madison Hall, restoration of the steps to the Rotunda and its
         terrace, construction of the east stairs to Alderman Library
         and the construction of a building at the Law School.</p>
