      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of items pertaining to William
         Bailey, John Sims, and William H. Sims of Halifax County
         Virginia. Correspondence, legal and financial papers, ledgers,
         commonplace books, a farm journal, a manuscript for an 1826
         speech, and papers regarding Episcopal High School and Halifax
         Academy comprise the bulk of the collection. The collection
         consists of material generated by Bailey's dry goods and
         tobacco business, operated under several names, including
         Bailey &amp; Young, Bailey &amp; Clark, and William Bailey
         &amp; Co., at Halifax Court House. The correspondence,
         financial records, and legal papers deal primarily with the
         sale of tobacco and general merchandise between 1800 and 1850.
         Most of the tobacco sold by Bailey was shipped from Halifax
         Court House to Richmond. Many of the financial and legal
         documents contain information regarding slaves, most of whom
         were owned by William Bailey or William Sims. Included are
         birth dates of slaves, mothers' names, bills of sale,
         agreements for the hire of slaves, tax lists, and records of
         tobacco production. A farm journal, 1855, gives a daily
         account of work done by slaves at William Sims' "River" and
         "House" farms. A list of items pertaining to Afro-Americans
         appears at the end of this guide.</p>
      <p>The correspondence, 1820-1888, is primarily letters to
         William Bailey concerning his mercantile and tobacco business,
         financial matters, land dealings, and family news. Other
         topics mentioned in Bailey's correspondence include: a
         bishop's "slandering" of Robert Hurt; the Roanoke Navigation
         Company; a nephew recently settled in Fayette County,
         Tennessee; a dispute over the sale of a slave named Paulina
         (see list of material pertaining to Afro-Americans at end of
         guide); and a mill in Danville. Other letters, 1864-1865,
         addressed to William H. Sims, concern the Civil War and the
         procurement of food from Sims' store. One letter (September
         12, 1864) R. H. Fitzhugh to Sims, mentions securing supplies
         for Fitzhugh's family, the evacuation of Atlanta, and a
         conference attended by Fitzhugh with Generals Jeremy Francis
         Gilmer, John C. Pemberton, and George Washington Custis Lee on
         contemplated changes in General Lee's troop dispositions.</p>
      <p>The legal papers, 1806-1878, include deeds of trust, bonds,
         articles of copartnership, deeds, wills, summonses, and court
         orders. Most of the legal documents involve William Bailey or
         William Bailey &amp; Co. Among the papers are three
         partnership agreements between Bailey and others (including
         John Clark, John H. Clark, and Clark Coleman) for a mercantile
         establishment at Halifax Court House and for a mill; an
         unsigned deed for land for a site for an Episcopal Church in
         the parish of Antrim; bonds for deputies; a deed for shares in
         the Roanoke Navigation Company; a 1773 plat of a tract bought
         by his father, William Sims, from John Randolph, father of
         John Randolph of Roanoke; a deed in which a wife was
         questioned separately from her husband before witnesses as to
         whether she wished to sell her inheritance; a deed of trust in
         which Reuben Lacy signed away any rights to his wife's
         inheritance.</p>
      <p>The financial papers, 1800-1871, include receipts, notes,
         and accounts, primarily of William Bailey or his dry goods and
         tobacco business. Also included in this section are financial
         and legal documents of estates for which Bailey served as
         executor, mill accounts, receipts of "overseers of the poor,"
         collections of bonds due Bailey, and tax lists for several
         years.</p>
      <p>The miscellaneous section includes items pertaining to
         Halifax Academy, for which Bailey served as treasurer, and
         Episcopal High School; two prescriptions, including one "For
         The Collick in Horses"; an account of a visit to the 1876
         Centennial in Philadelphia; a speech by John H. Clark in the
         fall of 1826 at Halifax Court House; and several printed
         items. Included in the material pertaining to Halifax Academy
         are receipts, student accounts, lists of students and subjects
         studied, as well as a legal document establishing Halifax
         Academy. Items pertaining to Episcopal High School include a
         printed list of school prizes for scholarship, an examination
         schedule, and several compositions and class exercises by
         student William B. Sims.</p>
      <p>There are eight bound volumes present, dating from 1805 to
         1871. Two, 1823-1825 and 1830-1846, are William Bailey's or
         his firm's records and include accounts and a list of debts
         owed the firm. Three ledgers, 1805-1828, 1829-1869, and
         1830-1852, of John Sims and William H. Sims are present. The
         first, 1805-1828, belonging to John Sims, includes accounts as
         well as several "lists of Negroes" and of "Negroes hired out"
         between 1804 and 1828, and prescriptions for the treatment of
         "poch" and "clap." A second ledger, 1829-1869, of John Sims
         and William H. Sims, contains accounts as well as "Lists of
         Negroes," 1834-1853, which contain birth dates and mothers'
         names. The third ledger, 1830-1852, of John Sims, contains
         blacksmith accounts with receipts, accounts, and a "list of
         Negroes the 1st April 1822" laid in, listing birth dates and
         names of mothers. A farm journal, January-August, 1855,
         belonging to William H. Sims, gives a daily account of farming
         activities, primarily the raising of tobacco, at "the River"
         and "the House," including the division of labor between men
         and women and children. The last two bound volumes are a
         commonplace book, 1855-1856, of Sallie Bettie Tayloe,
         containing poems written by friends, and a commonplace and
         composition book, 1871, kept by William B. Sims, while a
         student at Episcopal High School.</p>
