         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>These five collections, 1940-1943, 1958 and 1964, all
         contain burial rosters of Confederate soldiers buried in the
         Soldiers' [sometimes known as the University or Confederate]
         Cemetery adjacent to the University of Virginia Cemetery as
         well as those in Charlottesville, Virginia cemeteries.
         Researchers are cautioned that there is not only duplication
         of documents and information within these collections but
         other items not relating to burials may accompany them.
         Nevertheless, this guide will describe only the various burial
         rosters and should not be considered as a complete description
         of the collections.</p>
         <p>Accession number 1235 constitutes the most accessible
         arrangement of these records and consists of a bound volume,
         "Key to the Map of the Soldier's Cemetery. University of
         Virginia. With an alphabetical index by States" on pages 1 to
         187. The map itself has not survived and few of the 1,097 men
         buried in this cemetery actually have any sort of visible
         markers for their graves.</p>
         <p>Pages 1 to 157 are headed by columns: "Number" (order of
         internment?); "Name"; "Command" (regiment and company);
         "N[umber] of feet from the U[niversity] C[emetery] wall to
         center of grave"; and, N[umber] of feet from wall next to the
         road to grave." There follows an "Index by State"
         (alphabetically, with regiments and companies pencilled in),
         pages 159-185; "Unknowns," page 186, and, "Recapitulation,"
         page 187. A 61- page typescript of the volume (but lacking
         regimental designations in the "Index by State" section) is
         also present; it is duplicated wholly or partially by
         materials in accession numbers 1675, 1777-a, and 5863.</p>
         <p>Also present with accession number 1235 is a newspaper
         section, "Confederate Graves In Charlottesville Cemeteries,"
         published in the Charlottesville 
         <title render="italic">Daily Progress</title>on January 29,
         1947. This was apparently a listing of Confederate veterans
         who died after the war (with a few exceptions) and were buried
         at either the Jewish, Maplewood, Memorial Park, Oakview,
         Riverview, or University cemeteries. Additions and corrections
         for this listing may be found in accession number 1675; an
         eight page typescript, "Confederate Crosses In Maplewood
         Cemetery--1940 Charlottesville Virginia," with a plan of the
         cemetery, is with accession number 1777.</p>

         burials in Charlottesville and at the University consult Ervin
         L. Jordan, Jr.'s 
         <title render="italic">Charlottesville and the University of
         Virginia in the Civil War</title>(1988); for details about
         Confederate grave markers ("Crosses") see Jay S. Hoar's
