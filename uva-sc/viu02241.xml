      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>There are forty-five items, 1917-1919, pertaining to <persname normal="Louis I. Jaffe">Louis
         Isaac Jaffé</persname> while serving in the U. S. Army during World War
         I, and as a member of the staff of the American Red Cross
         commission to the Balkans. Included are electrostatic copies
         of his handwritten diaries kept during this period, and
         fifteen photographs of Jaffé and others taken at Fort Myer,
         Virginia; Leon Springs, Texas; and Is-sur-Tille, Vichy, and
         Paris, France. There are also papers, February 1919,
         concerning his discharge from the Army in Europe in order to
         work for the Red Cross; travel certificates, orders, and a
         special pass, 1919, for travel between France and Germany, for
         service with the Red Cross; and, authorization, October 1,
         1919, to leave Paris for South Boston, Virginia. Miscellaneous
         items include programs and tickets for several plays in Paris
         and a brochure for the American Officers' Hotel (Hotel du
         Louvre).</p>
      <p>When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Jaffé
         was a political writer and assistant city editor of the
         Richmond Times-Dispatch. He resigned from the paper and joined
         the Army. He was sent to Officers' Training Camp at Fort Myer,
         Virginia, where he was commissioned 2d lieutenant of field
         artillery, and he later received further training at Leon
         Springs, Texas. He was transferred to the aviation section of
         the U. S. Signal Corps in December 1917, and after training at
         Kelly Field, Texas, went overseas with the 649th Aero Supply
         Squadron, arriving in France in April 1918. The first diary
         begins just prior to his arrival in France. During the
         remainder of the war he was on duty with the Services of
         Supply, American Expeditionary Forces. On being mustered out
         of the service in March 1919, he became a member of the staff
         of the American Red Cross commission to the Balkans, and in
         July returned to Paris as director of the American Red Cross
         news service. The diaries record Jaffé's experiences in the U.
         S. Army during World War I, and with the American Red Cross
         from March-June 1919.</p>
