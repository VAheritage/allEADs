      <scopecontent>
        <head>Series I: Williams Family</head>
        <p>This series consists of 1200 items, 1798-1980 (Boxes 1
            to 4). William Clayton Williams (1768-1817) was at one time
            a lawyer in Woodstock, Virginia and deputy clerk of
            Shenandoah County. (His brother, Major John Williams, was
            the clerk.) He moved to Richmond from Fredericksburg in
            1808 and was married to Alice Grymes Burwell (?--1847), a
            daughter of Lewis and Judith Page Burwell. His children
            were Lewis Burwell and Lucy Page. Williams served as a
            member of a Richmond vigilance committee headed by John
            Marshall for the defense of the city against a possible
            British invasion in 1813. He and his wife were buried at
            Culpeper. His papers, 1798-1816, consist mostly of letters
            and a few financial and legal papers. An April 23, 1805
            letter briefly discusses mortgaging slaves; a June 28, 1807
            letter mentions in passing Aaron Burr's treason trial in
            which Williams was associated in a peripheral role.</p>
        <p>Lewis Burwell Williams (1802-1880) was a member of the
            Virginia House of Delegates in 1830 and was Commonwealth's
            Attorney in Orange County for forty-seven years. He was
            admitted to Princeton University as a sophomore on November
            9, 1815 and joined the Whig Society that same year. On
            January 14, 1817 his father requested that he be removed
            from the school but on January 21 he was expelled for
            participating in a riot. 
            <emph render="super">1</emph>He was married to Mary Catlett
            Williams and resided at the family home, "Yatton." His
            papers, 1833-1880, are chiefly financial and legal in
            nature. Items of interest among his papers include
            testimony circumstances surrounding the death of William F.
            Mitchell in 1878, ordinances of the corporation of Orange
            [1840s], and his bankbook account with the First National
            Bank of Alexandria, 1871-1879.</p>
        <p>John Green Williams (1843-1911) was the son of Lewis
            Burwell and Mary Catlett Williams. While a student at the
            College of William and Mary he joined the Confederate Army
            and was attached to the staff of General Jubal Early as a
            courier. He earned a law degree in 1870 and was Orange
            County clerk from 1869 to 1871. In 1880 he succeeded his
            father as Commonwealth's Attorney for that county and
            served for twenty-four years. He was married to Catherine
            Murat Willis (1848-1917). Papers concerning the
            presentation of his portrait to Orange County in 1953 are
            the only items regarding him in the collection.</p>
        <p>John Langbourne Williams (1831-1915) was a Richmond
            banker. He was the son of John and Sianna Armistead
            (Dandridge) Williams. He earned an A. M. degree from the
            University of Virginia in 1851 and a D.Litt. degree from
            Washington and Lee University in 1908. He married Maria
            Ward Skelton on October 13, 1864 and during the Civil War
            was a member of Lancaster &amp; Company, Confederate
            financial agents. After the conclusion of the war he
            established John L. Williams and Sons; the firm assisted in
            the refunding of South Carolina's debt. Associated with the
            founding and reorganization of various railroads, Williams
            was also president of the Richmond Male Orphan Society,
            Memorial Hospital, the Southern Churchman Company, and
            treasurer of the Virginia Negro Reformatory. His papers,
            1880 &amp; 1886-1915, include correspondence, select
            printed versions of his speeches and articles, calling
            cards, a lock of his(?) hair, and an obituary
            publication.</p>
        <p>Maria Ward Skelton Williams (1843-1929), wife of John
            Langbourne Williams, is represented by her correspondence
            with family members and acquaintances, 1847-1925. Of
            particular interest among these is an 1850 letter written
            by her at age eight from a Mr. Berkeley's school in Amelia
            or Powhatan County discussing her activities, and
            typescript copies of letters, 1854, 1861 &amp; 1863, from
            her cousin, noted author John Esten Cooke (1830-1886),
            while he was a soldier in the Confederate Army stationed in
            Amelia County and the town of Leesburg. Cooke describes
            camp life and his daily activities and mentions several
            mutual friends. Present in a separate folder are letters to
            her from her brother, E. W. Skelton, 1906 &amp; 1914,
            1916-1917. Skelton was a San Francisco real estate agent
            and his July 4, 1906 letter discusses the earthquake of
            April 18 and its aftermath.</p>

            economics. He later became associated with his father's
            bank, John L. Williams and Sons. The few papers present in

            obituary announcement about his life, a letter addressed to
            him, and a legal document concerning a lawsuit which
            included him among the plaintiffs.</p>

        <head>Series II: Lewis Catlett Williams Papers</head>
        <p>Lewis Catlett Williams (1875-1959), a Richmond lawyer
            and community leader, was the son of John Green Williams,
            Commonwealth's Attorney for Orange County, and was born at
            the family estate of "Wood Park" in that county. After
            receiving instruction at private schools he attended
            Woodberry Forest High School from 1889 to 1893. Williams
            earned B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of
            Virginia and studied law there from 1896 to 1898, became an
            honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa, and managed the
            University's football team. After being admitted to the New
            York bar in 1899 he was employed by the law firms of Wilmer
            &amp; Canfield, and later, Bowers and Sands. He moved to
            Richmond in 1900 and passed a special bar examination which
            had been authorized for him by the General Assembly. He
            then was employed in the offices of Munford, Hunton,
            Williams and Anderson but in 1905 formed a partnership with
            A. Caperton Braxton; four years later he formed another
            partnership which led to the creation of the firm of
            Williams, Mullen and Hazelgrove (later Williams, Mullen
            &amp; Pollard and Rogers).</p>
        <p>Williams married Maria Ward Skelton Williams (of another
            Williams family), the daughter of John L. Williams, in
            1902. They had nine children: Maria, Lewis Catlett, Jr.
            (who died at age three), Fielding Lewis (who practiced law
            with his father), the Reverend Peyton Randolph, the
            Reverend John Page (a Rhodes Scholar), Cyane Dandridge,
            Murat Willis (Ambassador to El Salvador), Dr. Armistead
            Dandridge, and Richard Burwell.</p>
        <p>From 1922 to 1946 he was a member of the Board of
            Visitors of the University of Virginia and from 1921 to
            1950 he was also a trustee of Woodberry Forest High
            School.</p>
        <p>Williams organized the Automobile Club of Virginia in
            1921 and served as its president for twenty-three years. He
            was a founder and president (1938-1939) of the Virginia
            State Bar Association. He instituted a successful campaign
            in 1933 that culminated with the establishment of a
            city-manager form of government for Henrico County. He was

        <head>Subseries A: Correspondence</head>
        <p>This subseries, 1922-1987 (Boxes 6 to 20), consists of
            Ambassador Williams' private and professional
            correspondence with family, friends, and contemporaries
            from various places around the world. Prominent
            correspondents include Alexander Wilbourne Weddell, Chester
            Bowles, James O. Eastland, Ogden R. Reid, Edgar F. Shannon,
            Jr., Walt W. Rostow, John O. Marsh, Jr., John Kenneth
            Galbraith, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., William Spong, Charles
            S. Robb, McGeorge Bundy, J. Kenneth Robinson, Frank L.
            Hereford, Harry F. Byrd, Jr., Henry Howell, J. Harry
            Michael, Andrew P. Miller, Thomas S. Kleppe, William P.
            Bundy, Virginius Dabney, Hubert H. Humphrey, Hugh Sidney,
            and Claiborne Pell. Of supplementary interest in his
            general correspondence is a 1938 letter from Mrs. Kermit
            Roosevelt and an invitation to a White House dance from
            Eleanor Roosevelt [December 22, 1938].</p>
        <p>Following the general correspondence are topical folders
            which contain letters pertaining Williams' education, his
            employment at the Richmond 
            <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">News Leader</title>(mostly letters
            from Douglas Southall Freeman), his Oxford associations,
            and, various letters from El Salvador, Hungary, Romania,
            and Greece. Edward R. Stettinius, Virginius Dabney, Oren
            Root, Jr., and Alexander Wilbourne Weddell are the more
            prominent correspondents in this group.</p>
        <p>The ambassador's Oxford years (Box 16) are represented
            by three folders of letters to his parents, especially his
            mother, 1936-1939 (followed by three additional folders
            containing letters addressed to Williams at Oxford in Boxes
            16 and 17) which discuss politics and life in Great
            Britain, Europe's sense of impending crisis prior to the
            outbreak of World War II, and the progress of his studies.
            Several 1938 letters comment on such incidents as efforts
            by German agents on behalf of an independent Ukraine
            [November 18] and social gatherings where King George VI,
            his Queen, and Mr. and Mrs. Charles A. Lindbergh were among
            the guests [May 22, 24 &amp; 29]. He was acquainted with
            Kathleen Kennedy, daughter of U. S. Ambassador Joseph P.
            Kennedy, and mentions events he attended with her or at
            which she and her father were present as guests of honor
            [May 22 &amp; 24, 1938; March 5 &amp; May 21, 1939].
            Williams also discusses tobacco tax problems in Virginia
            [October 28, 1938].</p>
        <p>There are several references to Lady Nancy Langhorne
            Astor (Viscountess Astor). Murat describes how Astor, while
            conducting a tour of "Cliveden" for he and his fellow
            Rhodes scholars, suddenly challenged them to a whistling
            contest [May 11, 1938] and his impressions of a speech by
            Winston Churchill in Parliament and Astor's behavior during
            the debates there [March 24, 1939]. These and other letters
            were mailed to the United States via several ships
            including the
