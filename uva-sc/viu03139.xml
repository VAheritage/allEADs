         George spent his winters in Florida and briefly resided in
         Aberdeen, Maryland. During World War II he served in the
         United States Army. Several years later, as his health began
         to fail, he returned to Charlottesville (the 1989 city
         directory describes him as retired and residing at his
         sister's home on 319 10.5 Street) and cared for his sister
         Mary until her death in 1991. For many years he was employed
         by Eljo's (a Charlottesville clothier) as a parking lot
         attendant. He was a member of Zion Union Baptist Church and
         died on December 28, 1992.</p>
      <p>George's items pertain to his military service. Among these
         is a May 1945 V-Mail letter from fellow Private Thomas Burns,
         Seine, France, describing his (Burns's) visit to Rouen while
         on leave and his good times with members of the Women's

         mimeographed sheet of a transport ship for returning American
         soldiers en route to New York; it describes world and ship's
         news.</p>
