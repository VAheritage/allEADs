      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>There are ca. 470 items, (1814-1910)1957 and n.d.,
         pertaining to various families of Lynchburg, Virginia,
         including the Adams, Davis, Dudley, and Johns families. There
         are correspondence, business and legal papers, miscellaneous
         writings, and bound volumes.</p>
      <p>There are letters from Andalusia (Fourquerean) Dudley and
         Ellen Dudley in Cincinnati, Ohio to their sister-in-law and
         aunt, Deborah Anne Dudley. On June 29, 1851 she writes while
         still mourning the loss of a loved one. She complains about
         having to take care of the house and the children because of
         the inexperience and absenteeism of their young
         African-American woman from Lynchburg, Virginia and discusses
         the children and their antics and Dr. Johnston, an apparent
         admirer and frequent visitor to their home. On August 8, 1851,
         she discusses the children and the new "kitchen girl" who is
         better than the previous girl even though she cannot cook and
         is good with the children. She also describes the procession
         celebrated by the firemen through Cincinnati of fifty or more
         companies, each with a different uniform, several bands of the
         most delightful music, and the representation of the different
         states' flags. On March 21st, Andalusia expresses her deep
         sympathy to Deborah over the death of her husband, William H.
         Kinckle. There is an undated letter regarding family news, her
         help "Jane" who is "willing poor thing but is a good deal
         troubled with a disease called laziness," missing the little
         ones since they commenced school, and cleaning up the house.
         There are also letters from Andalusia's daughter, Ellen
         Dudley, following their move from Lynchburg, Virginia to
         Cincinnati, Ohio. On May 18, [1851], she writes describing
         their travel through White Sulphur Springs and Hawk's Nest,
         West Virginia on their way to Cincinnati; she mentions their
         reception upon arrival, taking piano lessons and staying in a
         boarding house until they find a place to live. On May 25,
         [1851], she writes about her new life in Cincinnati,
         mentioning shopping, clothes, finding a new place to live, and
         being visited by a Dr. Johnston who appears to be taken with
         her mother. On December 19, 1851, she writes that hard lessons
         and music take up much time, reminisces over times with the
         family, describes the market houses in the city, and writes of
         family news including a child sick with inflammation of the
         lungs.</p>
      <p>There are letters, 1849-1857, from Henry Dudley in various
         places including Cincinnati, Ohio and San Francisco,
         California. Early letters from Cincinnati discuss family news,
         Mrs. Stowbridge the landlady and her sisters, Catholics, the
         ladies of Cincinnati as being "unpretty" (April 11, 1849); no
         news of a fire in the city (May 4, 1849); business reviving
         somewhat following the cholera epidemic and the Ladies of
         Covington holding a fair (June 7, 1849); Deborah's
         presentiment that she will not live long and her growth, his
         preference for Virginia women, and various women acquaintances
         (August 24, 1850). In a letter of January 12, 1851, from St.
         Louis, Missouri, he discusses life at the boarding house and
         being taken care of by Mrs. Avery and her two daughters and
         another boarder, Mose Hillard ("one of those boys you read
         about"); mentions meeting many from Lynchburg including Dick
         Scruggs, John Cannon, Bob and Dick Walton, Apperson
         Fitzgibbons and John William Royall; and, advises brother
         William and family to take up residence in Covington, Kentucky
         instead of Cincinnati with its members of the Free Soil party
         and free African-Americans. There is also an interesting
         letter dated June 24, 1852 from the Steamer 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Cherokee</title>discussing his trip
         from Richmond, Virginia to New York, New York, on the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Baltimore</title>after the Steamer 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Roanoke</title>went aground at City
         Point. His arrival was "amidst all the noise bustle and
         confusion of the Whig Convention" and his stay initially at
         the U. S. Hotel. He describes a tour through Broadway, Fifth
         Avenue, the Italian Opera, Tripler Hall, Cosetti Garden, and
         Brooklyn. He writes about a business man, Mr. Watson, who has
         made a great deal of money with his store and "large factory
         for making sigars [sic], snuff and fine cut tobacco..." He
         also describes his short voyage with some 400 passengers of
         Dutch, Irish, French, Spanish, English, and American and
         mentions a fire on the ship, seasickness and sea animals.</p>
      <p>There are letters, 1852-1857, from Henry Dudley while
         living in San Francisco, California. On November 30, 1852, he
         mentions the anticipation when the telegraphic signal is
         displayed on Telegraph Hill that a mail steamer is in sight,
         the rainy reason, destructive fires, cost of living, and Miss
         Catherine Hayes giving a concert at the American Theatre. On
         April 18, 1853, he writes that they expect to have weekly
         communications with the states and mentions the current
         monotonous life in San Francisco, the great robber Joaquin,
         corresponding with a certain young lady, and his failed
         attempt at growing a beard. On May 28, 1853, he writes about
         his change of quarters to the house of Carrington and Jeffrey
         as "chief cook and bottle washer" and describes his living
         arrangement. He refers to Robert Leslie Dudley's
         accomplishments in school, mentions having several chances in
         a grand raffle of jewelry and encloses three gold quarters. On
         July 30, 1853, he writes about the Fourth of July celebration
         during which the military were reviewed by General [John
         Augustus] Sutter (1803-1880) and then formed a procession, and
         mentions going to Sacramento on business. On March 15, 1854,
         he compliments the daguerreotypes of Deborah, Rose, and Robert
         that he has received from Adams and Company and sends regards
         to George Lyman. He also discusses the entertainment in San
         Francisco, writing that there are four theatres, several
         concert halls, and a quantity of stars including Madame Anna
         Thillon, Madame Anna Bishop, the Roussell sisters, and the
         Montplaisir troupe. On July 31, 1854, he mentions their Fourth
         of July celebration with military firing of cannons and an
         attempted display of fireworks; the death of Colonel [ ]
         Irving; the birth of a son to Peter Lewis Dudley; the order of
         'Know Nothings' being organized there; the numerous 'Do
         Nothings'; the fire epidemic over the last two months which
         affected Marysville, Sacramento and San Francisco; citizens'
         reactions and actions during and after the fires; and, his
         thoughts on the prospect of marriage. On December 5, 1854, he
         writes of the difficulties of Peter Lewis Dudley, trying to
         locate Sam Preston, and the retirement of Messrs. Carrington
         and Jeffrey from the storage business. He also discusses the
         weather and how the rain affects the merchant business and
         discusses the markets, which are full of vegetables and fruits
         as well as game such as duck, geese, quail, venison and
         grizzly bears. On January 23, 1855, he writes that he has
         found employment with Goodwin and Company, one of the largest
         wholesale grocery establishments in the area, and discusses
         the current market business. He also mentions the weather, the
         civilization of San Francisco, and several acquaintances, Mr.
         Heath, Captain Fair, and Henry P. Irving. On June
         4, 1856, he discusses the corruption in San Francisco,
         consisting of ballot stuffers, shoulder strikers, and corrupt
         politicians, the murder of the best men in the community, and
         the governor's order to bring out the militia. The writing
         sheet contains two sketches (in life and in death) of James
         King of William, editor of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">San Francisco Evening
         Bulletin</title>murdered by James P. Casey on May 14, 1856. On
         August 20, 1856, he writes a brief letter on the inside of a
         bulletin, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The California News Messenger</title>,
         compiled by Joseph Weed and published by George H. Leland. On
         July 20, 1857, he acknowledges the sad news of the death of
         their father, Peter Dudley, and comments on the strength of
         their mother, Nancy (Davis) Dudley. He mentions that Captain
         Fair has gone to Yreka, California and that hard times are
         with them, and claims that he still considers Lynchburg to be
         his home. One November 3, 1857, he writes about the shipwreck
         of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Central America</title>, commenting on
         the gallant conduct of the men who sacrificed their own lives
         in order to help the women and children to safety. On December
         4, 1857, he mentions that the rainy season has commenced, that
         they are in remarkable easy circumstances in comparison to the
         East, and the loss of employment throughout the East. He also
         mentions the news of an altercation between United States
         troops and the Mormons and the possibility of fighting the
         'Utahs'.</p>
      <p>Letters, 1851-1854, from Peter Lewis Dudley to his sisters
         are brotherly in nature, often giving advice and supplying
         news of the family. On March 30, 1851, he writes from
         Richmond, describing his trip with William Dudley to
         Cincinnati, Ohio and then to Louisville, Kentucky and New
         Orleans, Louisiana on the Steamer 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Magnolia</title>. He writes at length
         about attending concerts and operas, including hearing the
         wonderful songstress Jenny Lind as well as a Prima Dona in the
         French Opera and [Isidoro] Truffi and [Teresa] Parodi. On
         August 23, 1852, he comments favorably on social life in
         Lynchburg and negatively in Cincinnati, Ohio and expounds on
         the virtues of the "hospitality &amp; civility of a gentleman"
         while reprimanding his sisters over their lack of courtesy in
         thanking Mrs. Young and Miss Clara Lyman for their hospitality
         while in Baltimore, Maryland. He expresses concern that
         Deborah and Rose will return from Cincinnati with "all sorts
         of notions about the sin and immorality of slavery" after
         being subjected to the words of the Free Soil party. He also
         expresses strong negative opinions about abolitionists, the
         Free Soil party and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Uncle Tom's Cabin</title>which he views
         as an abolition document causing incitement. On June 28, 1853,
         he announces his engagement to Miss Bettie Saunders and
         expresses apprehension over his character and making her
         happy. On March 31, 1854, he suggests that Deborah and Rose
         buy something for their spring and summer wardrobe on his
         account with Dudley and Johnston while in Richmond. An undated
         letter strongly requests that Deborah and Rose not attend the
         Club that night and promises an explanation later.</p>
      <p>There are letters, 1846-1847, from Robert Leslie Dudley
         following his arrival in Ohio. On October 18, 1846, he writes
         from Chillicothe, Ohio, discussing his travel through
         Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Wheeling, West Virginia, and
         Zanesville, Ohio to his current destination. He writes that
         Chillicothe is the "only respectable community...in Ohio,"
         that he attended the Episcopal Church, and that he is moving
         on to Cincinnati. On October 8, 1847, he writes from
         Cincinnati about attending the theatre, concerts, museums and
         the observatory, mentioning wax figures, paintings and a
         mechanical apparatus representing the 'infernal regions'. He
         writes that he has no female acquaintances and that there is
         too much "Yankeeism" in the women there.</p>
      <p>There are later letters, 1861-1864, from Robert Leslie
         Dudley during the time of the Civil War. On February 8, 1861,
         he writes from Cincinnati about the
         hard times and the dull business, especially in the book line.
         He refers to the Ohio papers and the rumors about Fort Sumter
         and Charleston, South Carolina; the effects of John Brown's
         invasion; and, mentions peoples' hopes that Virginia will save
         the Union and almost wishing that she were for secession. In a
         letter dated December [February ? ]5, 1864, he writes from
