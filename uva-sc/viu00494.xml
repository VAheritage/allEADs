        <p>The Morton-Halsey Collection was loaned to the Library
            by Mr. G. Morton Halsey, II, "Lessland," Culpeper,
            Virginia, in September 1952. It was made a gift to the
            Library by the great-grandchildren of Jeremiah Morton: Mrs.
            Frances Halsey Towe, Mrs. Harriet Halsey Bartlett, and Mr.
            Glassell Morton Halsey in September 1978.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The 
         <famname>Morton</famname>- 
         <famname>Halsey</famname>collection consists of ca. 21,000
         items (39 Hollinger boxes, ca. 14 linear shelf feet), ca.
         1786-1938 composed of correspondence, financial and legal
         papers, business records, account books, bills, receipts,
         newsclippings, broadsides, and other printed materials,
         chiefly concerning 
         <persname>Jeremiah Morton</persname>and his son-in-law, 
         <persname>Joseph J. Halsey</persname>.</p>
      <p><persname>Jeremiah Morton</persname>(1799-1878) of 
         <geogname>Racoon Ford, Orange County, Virginia</geogname>, was
         born in 
         <geogname>Fredericksburg, Virginia</geogname>. He was educated
         at 
         <corpname>Washington College</corpname>(now 
         <corpname>Washington and Lee University</corpname>) and at the
         <corpname>College of William and Mary</corpname>. Morton began
         his career as lawyer in 1822, but abandoned his practice due
         to poor health. He was elected by the Eighth District of 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>to the thirty-first 
         <corpname>United States Congress</corpname>(1849-1851) but
         failed to gain re-election in 1850.</p>
      <p>The correspondence from the Civil War years documents
         Morton's attendance at the 
         <corpname>Virginia Secession Convention of 1861</corpname>,
         his appointment as a colonel in the cavalry by Governor 
         <persname>John Letcher</persname>, and his attempts to amass
         food during shortages of 1864. Of related interest is a
         lengthy autobiographical account of the career of 
         <persname>William "Extra Billy" Smith</persname>, written in
         1873 when Smith was running for U. S. Senate. The account
         includes his election to public office as 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>state senator (1836), governor
         (1845), and U. S. congressman (1853-1859), and describes some
         of his Civil War experiences. A comparison of Morton's pre-and
         post-war correspondence illustrates the plummeting of family
         and business fortunes which followed the Confederate defeat.
         Such conditions are illustrated in Morton's correspondence
         with his brother, Senator 
         <persname>Jackson Morton</persname>of 
         <geogname>Milton, Florida</geogname>; with Jackson's son, 
         <persname>W. Chase Morton</persname>; and with 
         <persname>Henry Ahrens</persname>, a 
         <geogname>Florida</geogname>businessman.</p>
      <p>Throughout his life, Morton was involved in a variety of
         land investment and business ventures which are documented in
         his correspondence. Among these ventures was a slave trade
         centered in 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>and in 
         <geogname>Mobile, Alabama</geogname>; an investment in the spa
         <geogname>White Sulphur Springs, Virginia</geogname>; and a
         tentative speculation in 
         <geogname>West Virginia</geogname>coal lands. Correspondence
         relating to the slave trade (ca. 1847-1863) is grouped with
         other relevant materials, including accounts and descriptions
         and values of slaves. (See also the listing of ledgers).
         Morton was also a member of the 
         <corpname>Texas Board of Trustees of the Southern Pacific
         Railroad</corpname>while the railroad was being built across
         that state in the 1850's and early 1870's, and a part of a
         group of Virginians who made loans to Texans.</p>
      <p>Other correspondence includes that of 
         <persname>Richard H. Maury</persname>and 
         <persname>William Maury</persname>or 
         <corpname>R. H. Maury and Company</corpname>of 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>(1867) discussing the sale of the
         <corpname>Virginia and Tennessee Railroad</corpname>, national
         politics, and 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>finances; of 
         <persname>Alexander H. Stephens</persname>concerning his book,
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the
            States</title></bibref>; of 
         <persname>John S. Barbour, Jr.</persname>concerning proposed
         land purchases by the 
         <corpname>Orange, Alexandria and Manassas Railroad</corpname>;
         of Reverend 
         <persname>John Cole</persname>concerning the rebuilding of 
         <geogname>Culpeper</geogname>churches (1866-1868); of 
         <persname>B. J. Sage</persname>commenting on politics; and of 
         <persname>Frederick J. Gamble</persname>, giving an account of
         the yellow fever epidemic in 
         <geogname>New Orleans</geogname>in 1867. Related materials
         consist of the 
         <famname>Morton family</famname>land grant (1786) signed by
         Governor 
         <persname>Patrick Henry</persname>, 
         <persname>Jeremiah Morton</persname>'s property in 
         <geogname>New Orleans</geogname>.</p>
      <p><persname>Joseph J. Halsey</persname>(ca. 1820-1894) was born
         and raised in 
         <geogname>Morristown, New Jersey</geogname>, and was educated
         at the 
         <corpname>College of New Jersey</corpname>(now 
         <corpname>Princeton University</corpname>). He moved to 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>around 1840, eventually to farm
         and practice law in 
         <geogname>Culpeper County</geogname>. After his marriage to 
         <persname>Mildred Morton</persname>in 1848 he became an
         increasingly close friend and business associate of her
         father, 
         <persname>Jeremiah Morton</persname>. Halsey served as a
         captain in the Confederacy army during the Civil War, after
         which he returned to his farm and legal practice. Joseph and
         Mildred Halsey had two sons, 
         <persname>J. Morton Halsey</persname>and 
         <persname>B. B. Halsey</persname>, and two daughters, 
         <persname>Fannie Halsey</persname>and 
         <persname>Annie Halsey</persname>.</p>
      <p><persname>J. J. Halsey</persname>'s correspondence has been
         divided into two main series: general correspondence, which is
         chiefly concerned with business matters centered in 
         <geogname>Culpeper County</geogname>; and family
         correspondence, which consists of letters from his father and
         siblings in 
         <geogname>New Jersey</geogname>and with his wife, children,
         and grandchildren.</p>
      <p>Early general correspondence (1840-1848) documents Halsey's
         attempts to begin a career and establish himself financially.
         He appears to have first considered an academic career, for he
         applied for the job of superintendent of 
         <geogname>Baltimore, Maryland</geogname>public schools, and
         for a professorship at the newly-founded 
         <corpname>University of Mississippi</corpname>. He also
         attempted to establish his own academy. After his marriage and
         the beginning of his legal career, Halsey's general
         correspondence becomes concerned mainly with legal and
         business matters, although it does include some discussion of
         farming and of slave trading. There is a limited amount of
         personal correspondence.</p>
      <p>The Civil War correspondence documents Halsey's career,
         first as a captain in the 
         <corpname>Virginia Cavalry Volunteers</corpname>, and then as
         quartermaster of the 
         <corpname>Sixth Virginia Cavalry</corpname>. In 1863, in
         response to a charge that he had been away without leave,
         Halsey wrote an account of his wartime activities until that
         time: a cycle of activity, failing health, leave, recovery,
         and return. The post-war correspondence includes accounts of
         Halsey's involvement as a shareholder in the 
         <corpname>Orange, Alexandria and Manassas Railroad</corpname>,
         his operation of a sawmill, and his dealings with the 
         <corpname>Emigrant Aid and Homestead Company</corpname>as
         agent for the sale of large tracts of 
         <geogname>Virginia land</geogname>.</p>
      <p>Later correspondence (1870-1894) includes an account of the
         destruction of the Halsey estate, " 
         <corpname>Lessland</corpname>, " by fire in 1870.
         Architectural estimates, plans, and costs relating to the
         rebuilding are included in the related materials which follow
         the correspondence. Through the 1870s, Halsey continued to be
         an agent for the sale of 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>lands. In 1884 he attempted to
         expand his agricultural concerns to include the raising of
         sheep and sale of wool. He died at " 
         <corpname>Lessland</corpname>" in 1894.</p>
      <p>The correspondence of 
         <persname>J. J. Halsey</persname>also includes letters and
         maps concerning the Knights of the Golden Horseshoe, and
         correspondence and papers related to Dr. 
         <persname>B. B. Halsey</persname>'s case with the newly formed
         state board of medical examiners, contesting their right to
         license physicians. Related materials include essays and verse
         by 
         <persname>J. J. Halsey</persname>, materials relating to the
         rebuilding of " 
         <corpname>Lessland</corpname>, " 
         <persname>B. B. Halsey</persname>'s examinations at 
         <corpname>Williston Seminary</corpname>, 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>, and papers concerning tuition,
         board and incidental expenses of 
         <persname>Irena Louisa Halsey</persname>at 
         <corpname>Piedmont Female Institute</corpname>. Of particular
         note is an 1855 registration form for 
         <persname>Andrew Johnson</persname>, "a person of colour,"
         indicating his status as "born free in the County of 
         <geogname>Orange, Virginia</geogname>, " and identifying him
         by his color, stature and marks or scars upon his face, head
         or hands. Also included are two pages from the notebook of 
         <persname>Mildred Halsey</persname>, which offer a day-by-day
         account of life while her husband is at war and Union forces
         occupy nearby areas.</p>
      <p>The family correspondence of 
         <persname>J. J. Halsey</persname>contrasts life in 
         <geogname>New Jersey</geogname>and in 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>during the period 1848-1894.
         Correspondents include Halsey's father, 
         <persname>Samuel B. Halsey</persname>; his brothers, 
         <persname>Samuel S. Halsey</persname>, 
         <persname>Edmund Halsey</persname>, and 
         <persname>Alexander Halsey</persname>; and his sisters 
         <persname>Susan Halsey</persname>and 
         <persname>Anne Halsey</persname>; as well as his wife,
         children and grandchildren. Especially interesting are the
         political exchanges, occasionally heated, between 
         <persname>J. J. Halsey</persname>and his younger brothers 
         <persname>Samuel S. Halsey</persname>and 
         <persname>Edmund Halsey</persname>, on subjects such as
         slavery, abolitionism, secession, the elections of Presidents
         Buchanan and Lincoln, the 
         <geogname>Missouri</geogname>Compromise, the 
         <geogname>Kansas</geogname>- 
         <geogname>Nebraska</geogname>Act, reconstruction, and the
         impeachment of 
         <persname>Andrew Johnson</persname>. More personal issues
         discussed include Halsey's marriage, his fears for his wife
         and daughters during their wartime separation, and financial
         problems in the difficult post-war years, when many prominent 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>families went into bankruptcy. In
         1868, the 
         <geogname>New Jersey</geogname>Halseys convinced 
         <persname>Mildred Halsey</persname>to send her two daughters
         north for their safety and education. 
         <persname>J. J. Halsey</persname>'s shocked letter when he
         heard of the arrangement and his conjectures about their trip
         to 
         <geogname>Washington</geogname>, traveling "unprotected...with
         nine pence and a carpetbag," (July 4, 1865) illustrates
         conditions in 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>at the time and indicates the
         tremendous emotional strain on the family.</p>
      <p>In addition to the 
         <geogname>New Jersey</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>correspondence, the collection
         contains letters of an elder brother, 
         <persname>Abraham Halsey</persname>, from 
         <geogname>California</geogname>. His letters provide an
         interesting sidelight on the controversies between the 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>and 
         <geogname>New Jersey</geogname>Halseys, and describe his own
         life as a rancher and as secretary to a large number of mining
         concerns.</p>
      <p>The Morton-Halsey collection also includes correspondence
         and related papers of the 
         <famname>Winston family</famname>, also of 
         <geogname>Culpeper County, Virginia</geogname>. As executor of
         the estate of 
         <persname>William Winston</persname>, 
         <persname>J. J. Halsey</persname>received letters from
         Winston's sons, 
         <persname>Wallace Winston</persname>, 
         <persname>Walter C. Winston</persname>, and 
         <persname>J. B. Winston</persname>. Halsey also came into
         possession of correspondence between the brothers, including
         letters from 
         <persname>J. B. Winston</persname>and 
         <persname>Timothy Foster</persname>in 
         <geogname>California</geogname>, to 
         <persname>Walter Winston</persname>in 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>, discussing personal property
         matters and 
         <geogname>California</geogname>politics. There are also
         letters of 
         <persname>Wallace Winston</persname>from 
         <geogname>Arkansas</geogname>.</p>
      <p>The second major series in this collection consists of
         financial and legal papers of 
         <persname>Jeremiah Morton</persname>, 
         <persname>J. J. Halsey</persname>, and others. They date from
         ca. 1800-1895 and include business and personal accounts,
         bills, receipts, promissory nots, tax receipts and papers
         concerning bankruptcy and insurance. Also included are deeds,
         bonds, indentures, wills, land surveys, plats, charts and
         other material concerning the purchase or transferral of land.
         There are also files on court related matters such as bills of
         complaint, legal opinions, summons and other court notices. Of
         particular interest are itemized tax receipts which document
         the ownership of slaves.</p>
      <p>Many of these documents are Morton's or Halsey's own
         personal records, including their accounts with area
         merchants. For the most part, however, the financial and legal
         papers in this series belong to a number of individuals,
         primarily residents of 
         <geogname>Madison</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Culpeper</geogname>or 
         <geogname>Orange</geogname>counties, 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>, whose affairs were handled by 
         <persname>J. J. Halsey</persname>. As a lawyer, Halsey often
         acted as executor of an estate or counsel, and therefore
         acquired all the legal papers and business accounts of his
         clients and neighbors. Individuals and firms listed are: 
         <persname>William C. Austin</persname>, 
         <corpname>Beechwood and Mallory</corpname>,

      <p>A series of printed material follows and includes business
         cards, personal calling cards, invitations, circular letters,
         blank forms, pamphlets and newspaper clippings. This series
         also contains numerous broadsides and advertisements. The
         printed material dates from ca. 1843-1911.</p>
      <p>The ledger series of the collection consists of eighteen
         volumes, 1812-1882. They are divided into three categories:
         Volumes of 
         <persname>Jeremiah Morton</persname>, Medical Volumes and
         Other Volumes. The volumes owned by 
         <persname>Jeremiah Morton</persname>date from 1817-1844. Of
         particular interest is Morton's personal account book that
         lists expenses and disbursements and includes references to
         transactions involving the sale of slaves. This volume doubles
         as a notebok of legal questions with page references and
         sections headed "The Rights of Things," "Toller's Law of
         Executors," and "Reeves Domestic Relations." The second group
         of volumes, 1812-1819, consists of two journals and a
         corresponding ledger belonging to 
         <persname>R. Briggs</persname>, M.D., of 
         <geogname>Madison, Virginia</geogname>. Journal entries
         include services performed by the doctor such as "pulling of a
         tooth," "examining wound," and "opening an abcess (throat),"
         and notations of the medicines he dispensed. Included at the
         end of the ledger is a list of medical books and their costs.
         The final group consists of twelve volumes, 1856-1882,
         including ledgers, journals, and a daybook belonging to a
         variety of residents of 
         <geogname>Madison</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Orange</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Culpeper</geogname>counties. Several volumes appear
         to be in the hand of 
         <persname>J. J. Halsey</persname>, while other volumes bear
         the names of 
         <persname>Charles B. Porter</persname>, 
         <persname>John A. Porter</persname>, 
         <persname>B. W. Brown</persname>, and 
         <corpname>Nalle, Fishback and Company</corpname>. All these
         individuals' accounts appear in Halsey's financial and legal
         papers.</p>
      <p>There are envelopes, wrappings and other miscellaneous
         fragments filed at the end of the collection.</p>

      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>This collection is divided into six main series: I.
         Correspondence; II. Financial and Legal Papers; III. Printed
         Material; IV. Ledgers; V. Envelopes, Wrappings, and Fragments;
         VI. Oversize Material.</p>
      <p>The first series, I. Correspondence, is comprised of three
         sub-series: A. Correspondence of 
         <persname>Jeremiah Morton</persname>(1. general
         correspondence, 2. topical correspondence and 3. papers, and
         related materials), Correspondence of B. 
         <persname>J. J. Halsey</persname>(1. general correspondence,
         2.family correspondence, 3. topical correspondence and 4.
         related materials), and C. Correspondence of the 
         <famname>Winston Family</famname>. The material within each of
         these subdivisions is arranged chronologically. The sub-series
         called "Related Material" consists of papers of a personal
         nature, including essays, architectural estimates, 
         <persname>Jeremiah Morton</persname>'s law certificate and
         examples of childrens schoolwork.</p>
      <p>The second series, II. Financial and Legal Papers, is
         divided into three subseries: A. Packets (1. individuals whose
         financial and legal affairs were handled by 
         <persname>Jeremiah Morton</persname>or 
         <persname>J. J. Halsey</persname>, 2. 
         <persname>Jeremiah Morton</persname>, and 3. 
         <persname>J. J. Halsey</persname>); B. Financial Papers (1.
         accounts and itemized receipts, 2. bills and receipts, 3. tax
         receipts, 4. checks, and 5. charts, tables and lists of
         numbers); C. Legal Papers (1. general legal papers, 2.
         promissory notes, 3. wills, 4. bankruptcy, 5. insurance, 6.
         land transactions and surveys, and 7. court related
         materials). In the first sub-series, the packets have been
         single-foldered and labeled according to the information on
         the original wrapping. These folders have been arranged in
         alphabetical order according to the name of the individual
         whose account Morton or Halsey managed. During the
         organization of this collection, it is apparent that it became
         apparent that all of the financial and legal material was at
         one time contained in packets. The names and dates on the
         envelopes and wrappings found in Series V. correspond to the
         names on the material not found in packets. Both 
         <persname>Jeremiah Morton</persname>and 
         <persname>J. J. Halsey</persname>kept their own personal
         financial and legal records bound up in packets and marked
         with a thin band of paper usually containing only the date.
         Packets which were found intact have been filed as a unit
         after the packets of the other individuals. Morton's records
         precede Halsey's, and both bear chronological arrangement. The
         financial papers are arranged chronologically by decade. The
         legal papers are also divided into smaller divisions. General
         legal papers include deeds, bonds, indentures, articles of
         agreement and some promissory notes. Most of the promissory
         notes have been removed and filed together following the
         general legal papers. These are followed by wills, materials
         concerning bankruptcy and insurance forms. Documents
         concerning land transactions include surveys, maps, plats and
         written agreements. The legal papers also include a number of
         court-related items including bills of complaint, legal
         opinions, summonses, and miscellaneous court notices. These
         papers are in chronological order within each subdivision.</p>
      <p>The ledger series is divided into three sub-series: A.
         Volumes of 
         <persname>Jeremiah Morton</persname>, B. Medical Volumes, and
         C. Other Volumes. Within each sub-series the volumes are
         arranged chronologically, with daybooks preceding journals and
         journals preceding ledgers. Dates and important annotations
         are entered on the list of ledgers in the text of this guide.
         Loose materials removed from the volumes are filed at the end
         of the ledger series in folders which correspond to the
         numbered volumes. The papers included in this group consist
         primarily of accounts, surveys, maps, newspaper clippings, and
         other printed material. There are numerous broadsides and
         advertisements, especially in the files which correspond to
         volumes 15 and 18. Personal letters were removed, noted, and
         filed with the correspondence series.</p>
      <p>Envelopes, wrappings, and fragments comprise the next
         series. The envelopes and wrappings with annotations are filed
         in front of those which bear no autograph marks except name
         and date. One can get a more complete picture of the extent of
         Morton's and Halsey' practice and names of their clients by
         examining the names and dates on these wrappings as opposed to
         the incomplete list of names which appears in the packet
         series. Miscellaneous fragments are filed at the end of the
         last series.</p>
      <p>The final series consists of oversize material, primarily
         broadsides and pages from account books.</p>
