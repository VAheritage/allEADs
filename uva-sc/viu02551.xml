      <p>This collection contains one letter, ALS, 1887 Feb 18,
         David Ames Wells to Charles W. Gardner and S. O'Donnell. Wells
         adresses the February 22 meeting of the Walden Tariff Reform
         Club concerning tariff reform and the previous presidential
         election; believes future of tariff policy connected to
         enlarging human liberty; states that each citizen has right to
         exchange property and work how and where he wants to, free
         from taxes and constrictions imposed for benefit of others;
         claims the defeat of industrial and commercial freedom for
         America is temporary; says the greatest obstacle to tariff
         reform was lack of popular interest and that the rush to use
         natural resources left no time for anything but business;
         gives example of an Ohio pig iron manufacturer; asserts people
         now recognize they have interest in theory and practice of
         national system taxation under tariff; claims now there is a
         great party behind tariff reform which is looking to what
         Garfield called ultimate free trade; believes Cleveland's
         message has made it an abiding political issue, accepted by
         Democratic party who will fight for it; mentions Chauncey
         Depew's description of the new supporting plea for commercial
         and industrial freedom; states that industry made large
         subscriptions to Republican Party in last election to defeat
         tariff reform believing it would guarantee protective system
         but tariff reform not defeated in popular vote, but 100,000
         majority; believes agitation should continue and that without
         reform taxes are a form of robbery; says any man protesting is
         entitled to redress and if it is not received then the
         Preamble to the Federal Constitution designed to establish
         justice, is a figment of words; convinced agitation for tariff
         reform will increase; thinks manufacturers will need great
         sums of money to win another presidential election; says
         advocates of more liberal commercial policy are disappointed
         that people were influenced by appeals to prejudice and
         sectionalism based on forged quotations allegedly from foreign
         journals; says party advocating taxes and restrictions had no
         case to argue before people; convinced political devices
         cannot delay the coming of a tariff reform; agrees with Henry
         Watterson who states that forces of modern life are working to
         overthrow a system handed down from middle ages to nineteenth
         century in which the few benefit from work of many.</p>
