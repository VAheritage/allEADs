      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This addition to the 
          Duke family papers contains ca. 10,400 items
         (38 Hollinger boxes, 12 linear shelf feet), 1764-1983, chiefly
         personal and topical correspondence, business papers, and
         legal papers of this prominent 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>family, and the related 
          Slaughter family of 
         <geogname>Lynchburg, Virginia</geogname>. The collection also
         has genealogical material, invitations (arranged by year),
         literary manuscripts and poetry by 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. (1853-1926),
         miscellaneous papers, printed material, school records and
         papers, photographs, diaries, account books, notebooks and
         other bound volumes, postcards and papers concerning a few
         legal clients of the 
          Duke and Duke law firm.</p>
      <p>The overwhelming bulk of the correspondence consists of
         letters to and from 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. , 
          Edith Slaughter Duke (1863-1921), his
         wife, and their children, 
          Mary Willoughby Duke (1885-1966); 
          Richard Thomas Walker Duke,
         III (1887-1960); 
          John Flavel Slaughter Duke , "Jack"
         (1889-1933); 
          William Eskridge Duke (1893-1959); and 
          Helen Risdon Duke (1895-1984).</p>
      <p>The correspondence subseries devoted to letters written to 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. contains three
         different groups of material: 1) letters from his wife, 
          Edith Slaughter Duke ; 2) an
         alphabetically arranged group of miscellaneous correspondents;
         and 3) a group of individual correspondents, each with his own
         folder.</p>
      <p>The letters from Edith to 
          Tom Duke , 1882-1921, were written
         whenever they were separated during their courtship, family
         visits, vacations, and business trips. As could be expected,
         most of these letters contain plans for furnishing their new
         home, family news, and personal messages, all of which
         chronicles the growth of the 
          Duke family .</p>
      <p>The alphabetical miscellaneous correspondence file has
         letters from college, fraternity and Masonic friends, business
         associates, and other acquaintances and includes merchandise
         orders, requests for speaking engagements, business matters,
         literary concerns, letters of sympathy and personal news.</p>
      <p>Letters of note in this group include the following
         correspondents and topics: 
          S. A. Duke (Dec. 9, 1908) re
         reconstruction and "the great negro question;" 
          A. Ranken Ford (Nov.23, 1914) re America's
         Civil War, 
         <geogname>England</geogname>'s preparation for World War I and
         <geogname>Germany</geogname>'s spying activities prior to the
         war; 
          George Gilmer (Jul. 28, 1918) re the
         important role of the 
          Y.M.C.A. in keeping up the morale of the
         American soldier in 
         <geogname>Europe</geogname>;

          Jessie Uppleby (Apr. 18, Jul. 5, Aug. 19,
         Nov. 22, 1917, and Aug. 29 [n.y.]) re World War I war news
         from 
         <geogname>Scotland</geogname>.</p>

          Mary Harker Slaughter and 
          Mary Willoughby Duke Slaughter .</p>
      <p>The letters to 
          Edith Duke include correspondence from 
          Myrtle Judson Duke , 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. , 
          Susan Harker Risdon and miscellaneous
         letters from friends and family, excluding her children.</p>
      <p>A third subseries of correspondence consists of letters
         from 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. and 
          Edith Duke to their children, Mr. and Mrs.
          R. T. W. Duke, Sr. and miscellaneous
         correspondents. Of note in this group is a volume of 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. 's letters from 
         <geogname>Europe</geogname>which contains transcripts of his
         letters home during his European tour of 1882. Duke describes
         his voyage over on a ship "Egypt," his companions and
         acquaintances, his itinerary in 
         <geogname>England</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Holland</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Germany</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Switzerland</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>France</geogname>, and the many museums, historic
         sites, and towns which he visited.</p>
      <p>The fourth subseries contains letters to and from the
         children of 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. , including
         correspondence with their parents and with each other. The
         sons of 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. , Walker, Jack, and
         Eskridge, were all in the armed forces during World War I, and
         their letters that decribe camp life and their war experiences
         are in the correspondence to their parents, 1917-1919.</p>
      <p>Jack 
          (John Flavel) Duke was an Air Service
         officer stationed at 
         <geogname>Post Field, Sill, Oklahoma</geogname>, and at 
         <geogname>Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas</geogname>, and his
         correspondence, 1917-1919, and no date, describes his flying
         experiences. Although 
          Eskridge Duke attended the 
          U.S. Naval Academy preparatory school at 
         <geogname>Annapolis, Maryland</geogname>and sailed as a
         midshipman on the U.S.S. Illinois from 1911-1913, he served
         during World War I in 
         <geogname>France</geogname>as an army officer with the 
          American Expeditionary Forces , from
         September of 1918 until May of 1919.</p>
      <p> R. T. Walker Duke 's letters to his
         parents from 1908-1911 describe his experiences in 
          Montana as a cowboy, his interest in
         homesteading, bronco riding, and his work as a printer. In
         1917, Walker was assigned to the 
          5th Illinois Company , 
         <geogname>Ft. Sheridan, Illinois</geogname>. His letters
         written during his service in 
         <geogname>Europe</geogname>run from October 1918 to March
         1919. After the conclusion of the war, Walker served with the 
          Judge Advocate General Department in 
         <geogname>Washington, D.C.</geogname>(letters to his parents,
         1920-1925).</p>
      <p> Mary Duke 's letters to her parents,
         1918-1926, and no date, describe her nursing experiences and
         other charitable work in the 
          Archdeaconry of Southwest Virginia with
         Mrs. 
          Hugh F. Binns at 
          Nora, Dickinson County, Virginia .</p>
      <p>Another interesting group of letters in this subseries are
         those of 
          William Eskridge Duke, Jr. to his family
         and to his aunts, 
          Mary Duke and 
          Helen Duke . 
          Bill Duke served in the navy during the
         Korean War and his letters describe the places which he
         visited on his tours of duty, such as 
         <geogname>Naples</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Athens</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Marseilles</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Guam</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Yokosuka, Japan</geogname>, 1949-1951.</p>
      <p>The correspondence of the Duke brothers and sisters to each
         other consists almost entirely of carbons or originals of
         letters concerning the personal business transactions of the
         family. It also reveals the financial difficulties of various
         family members during the Depression years.</p>
      <p>The 
          Slaughter family correspondence comprises
         the fifth subseries of correspondence and contains letters to
         and from members of 
          Edith Slaughter Duke 's family, including
         her parents, 
          Mary Harker and 
          John Flavel Slaughter, Sr. , and her
         brothers and sisters. The letters from Dr. 
          Blanche Rosalie Slaughter Morton , a
         graduate of the 
          Women's Medical College of
         Pennsylvania (1897) and practicing surgeon, form one
         of the most interesting sections of this correspondence. She
         describes her travels in 
         <geogname>Europe</geogname>(May 11, September 19, and 24,
         1899); her concern for the 
          Lee family in 
         <geogname>China</geogname>during the struggle of the
         Kuomintang with the warlords for political supremacy (March
         29, 1927); her trip to 
         <geogname>Mexico</geogname>(July 25, 1928) and the 
         <geogname>Middle East</geogname>(November 4, 1935).</p>
      <p>Most of the Slaughter correspondence concerns either
         business matters or family news with a few exceptions. 
          Charles Slaughter, Sr. writes concerning a
         strike and riot in 
         <geogname>Duluth, Minnesota</geogname>(July 7, 1889); 
          Charles M. Harker, Sr. describes the
         meeting of the American Convention ( 
          Know-Nothing Party ) in 
         <geogname>Philadelphia</geogname>(June 10, 1855); Mary B[?]
         R[?]'s letters, 1861-1862, provide a woman's view of the Civil
         War; and 
          Samuel Slaughter describes his trip to 
         <geogname>Ireland</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Scotland</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>England</geogname>(July 24, August 1 &amp; 5, 1889).
         Members of the 
          Garland family write concerning family news,
         Dr. 
          [Erasmus] Darwin 's theory of the earth,
         and the significance of fossils, and General Hull's activities
         at 
         <geogname>Sandwich</geogname>in 
         <geogname>Canada</geogname>during the beginning of the War of
         1812 (August 4, 1812); and a trip to 
         <geogname>Boston</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Montreal</geogname>(August 1 &amp; 11, 1851).</p>
      <p>Of note among the miscellaneous correspondence are two
         letters from 
          John Singleton Mosby , one to 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. (September 27, 1915)
         acknowledging Duke's letter of sympathy on the loss of Mosby's
         son, and another to Captain 
          Sam Chapman (September 30, 1919)
         concerning the manifesto of the "Stonewall Jackson Camp" at 
         <geogname>Staunton</geogname>about the role of Southern
         soldiers in the Civil War.</p>
      <p>Also of interest are the letters, 1895-1954, from 
          Mary Lee and 
          Claude Lee , an Episcopal medical
         missionary family in 
         <geogname>Wisuh, China</geogname>. They ran a hospital and
         dispensary from 1908 until ca. 1947. Although their letters
         reveal various aspects of missionary life and personal family
         news, they contain little of Chinese events. One letter by 
          Claude Lee (October 13, 1918) speaks of
         the participation of the 
          8th Czecho-Slovak Regiment in a battle
         against the Bolsheviks in the 
         <geogname>Ural Mountains</geogname>near 
         <geogname>[Tagelove ?], Russia</geogname>, during World War
         I.</p>
      <p>The last subseries of correspondence consists of topical
         files concerning the American Legion and World War I; business
         correspondence of 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. ; the publication of
         the poetry of 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. ; the rental of the
         Duke's Park Street house; the will of 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. ; and the 
          St. Paul's Memorial Building Fund .</p>
      <p>The other six non-correspondence series comprise about a
         third of the collection and include: manuscripts and
         miscellaneous papers, photographs, bound volumes and
         notebooks, postcards, papers from the 
          Duke and Duke law firm and oversize
         items.</p>
      <p>The manuscripts and miscellaneous papers series contain the
         personal business papers of the 
          Duke and related families, especially the 
          Slaughter family . There is also a sizeable
         amount of family financial material in the Papers of the 
          Duke and Duke Law Firm at the 
          University of Virginia Law Library .</p>
      <p>Other types of material in this series include;
         genealogical material, with a typescript about 
          Mary Harker Slaughter by her son, 
          William A. Slaughter ; invitations; legal
         papers, including indentures, deeds, agreements, land surveys,
         etc.; manuscripts by 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. , both poetry and
         prose, including "Albemarle County and the City of
         Charlottesville in War Time," "Libraries and Their Contents,"
         "Pearls and Pebbles," typescripts of portions of his
         "Recollections," (the whole five volumes of Duke's
         "Recollections" of his life can be found in 9521-i); printed
         material, including Masonic items and an undated political
         pamphlet entitled "Mahoneism Unveiled!"; and Duke family
         school records and papers.</p>
      <p>The photographic series consists of both identified and
         unidentified photographs. Identified photographs contain the
         following categories: Judge 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. , 
          R. T. W. Duke, Sr. , men and women in the 
          Duke and related families, 
          Rosalie Slaughter Morton , miscellaneous
         men and women, European scenes, places, photographs of a trip,
          University of Virginia , and 
          Zeta Psi Brothers and 
          University of Virginia friends.
         Unidentified photographs have been placed in the following
         groups: animals, children, groups and families, men, places,
         and women.</p>
      <p>Series four, consisting of bound volumes and notebooks,
         contains primarily diaries and notebooks of the immediate 
          Duke family members. The fifth series has 
         <geogname>United States</geogname>, foreign, and topical
         postcards. The 
         <geogname>United States</geogname>postcards are separated
         first by state and then by city or county; the foreign by
         country only, and the topicals are grouped together.</p>
      <p>The papers of the 
          Duke and Duke law firm contain incomplete
         case files handled by the family law firm. Among these are 
          Maria Carter v. 
          Roy Brown ; 
          J. E. Costan v. 
          Downing L. Smith ; Dr. Funsten v. 
          W. Ed. Pickering ; 
          Insurance Company of Charlottesville v. 
          V. W. F. Carter, Jr. ; the 
          Kentucky Coal Company , 
          Pike County Coal Company , and 
          Ohio and Big Sandy Coal Company ; 
          Jefferson M. Levy Legal Papers; 
          Piedmont Gas and Oil Corporation v. 
          R. S. Duncan ; and Snyder v. 
          University of Virginia . Most of the law
         firm's papers are located in the 
          University of Virginia Law Library .</p>
      <p>The last series consists of oversize documents and
         photographs.</p>

    <arrangement>
      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>Because this collection was not received by the Library in
         any discernible order, the material has been arbitrarily
         placed into seven different series. These include: I)
         Correspondence; II) Manuscripts and Miscellaneous Papers; III)
         Photographs; IV) Bound Volumes and Notebooks; V) Postcards;
         VI) Papers from the Duke and Duke law firm; and VII) Oversize
         Items.</p>
      <p>Due to the large amount of correspondence present in this
         collection, the correspondence series has been further broken
         down into seven subseries: A) Letters to 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. (boxes 1-9); B) Letters
         to 
          Edith Duke (boxes 10-11); C) Letters from 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. and 
          Edith Duke (box 12); D) Letters to and
         from the children of 
          R. T. W. Duke, Jr. (boxes 13-20); E) 
          Slaughter Family Correspondence (boxes
         20-22); F) Miscellaneous Correspondence (box 23); G) Topical
         Correspondence (box 24)</p>
