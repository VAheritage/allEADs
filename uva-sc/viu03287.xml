      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Robert Garlick Hill Kean, the son of John Vaughan and
         Caroline (Hill) Kean, was born in Caroline County, Virginia on
         24 October 1828. His father was a schoolteacher and planter of
         modest means. After attending Episcopal High School in
         Alexandria, Virginia, Rappahannock Academy, and Concord
         Academy, Kean attended the University of Virginia, receiving
         his BA in 1852 and his MA the following year. He was admitted
         to the bar the following year and began practicing law in
         Lynchburg, Virginia. Kean was a vestryman in the Episcopal
         Church and a lifelong Democrat. He married Jane Nicholas
         Randolph, the daughter of Thomas J. Randolph, in 1854. In
         1874, his first wife having died, he married Adelaide
         Prescott. Kean had five children by his marriages. An extreme
         states' rights advocate, he urged secession and joined the
         Virginia Home Guard at an early date. When the war began, he
         entered the Confederate Army as a private in the Southern Army
         of the Potomac, but after the battle of First Manassas he was
         made adjutant general to George W. Randolph, his uncle by
         marriage. When Randolph became secretary of war, Kean was
         named chief of the Bureau of War, succeeding Albert Taylor
         Bledsoe. He held this office for the remainder of the war,
         acting as office manager, exectutive secretary, and research
         assistant for the various secretaries of war. After the war,
         he returned to his law practice in Lynchburg. In 1881, he was
         city attorney in Lynchburg, and in 1890, he was made president
         of the Virginia Bar Association. He refused to run for
         political office and wanted to repay all of his war debts. He
         died in 1898.</p>
