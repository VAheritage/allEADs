      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>In this March 24, 1863 letter to his older brother Charles
         Carter Lee, General Robert E. Lee, commander of the Army of
         Northern Virginia, writing from his Fredericksburg
         headquarters, discusses recent military events, family
         members, and several prominent Confederate officers. (Lee, who
         had been ill, had just returned from consultations with
         Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond, March
         12-18, 1863.) 
         <emph render="super">1</emph>He speculates on forthcoming
         movements of the Army of the Potomac under the command of
         General Joseph Hooker, 
         <emph render="super">2</emph>describes the battle of Kelly's
         Ford [March 17, 1863, Kelleysville, Virginia], mourns the
         death of artillerist Major John Pelham (" I do not know how I
         can replace the gallant Pelham"), praises the leadership of
         his nephew General Fitzhugh Lee at Kelly's Ford, and mentions
         varied estimates of the strength of Union forces as reported
         by his scouts and General James Ewell Brown "Jeb" Stuart
         [commander of Lee's cavalry corps].</p>
      <p>Lee also makes passing references to a Mrs. Taylor [Mrs. W.
         P. Taylor, a relative], General Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall"
         Jackson, Union attacks against Charleston, South Carolina, and
         several family members including his sister-in-law "Sis" Lucy
         and niece Mildred (wife and daughter of Charles Carter) and
         his own son, George Washington Custis Lee, whom his praises as
         "a fine boy." He concludes with a seriocomical request that
         his brother's family and farmers should go to the fields and
         raise corn ("We are in great need, both man [&amp;] beast")
         else he "shall have to call for aid upon our glorious
         women."</p>

      <p>Camp Fred[erick]s[burg, Virginia] 24 March '[18]63 
         <lb/>My dear brother Carter: 
         <emph render="super">i</emph><lb/>I have rec[eive]d your letter of the 18th &amp; will
         endeavor to forward the enclosure to Mrs. Taylor. 
         <emph render="super">ii</emph>I do not Know where she is now.
         When last at her house on the Rapp[ahannock] R[iver] the enemy
         Seemed to be preparing to cross very near it. Whether it was a
         feint or a reality I Could not tell, but recommended they
         should make arrangements to evacuate if necessary &amp; I have
         heard they proposed going to their Country house in the
         [forest?]. Genl. Jackson 
         <emph render="super">iii</emph>is quite near me &amp; her
         residence is not near him. The weather has been very
         unfavorable to those exposed to it, &amp; the roads are nearly
         impassable. Genl. Hooker 
         <emph render="super">iv</emph>Seems to be prepared for a move
         Somewhere, &amp; this day [week] the indications were he was
         Coming over, He threw his Cav[alr]y over Kellys ford, &amp;
         brought his inf[antr]y to the U. S. ford [U. S. Ford] just
         below the mouth of Rapidan [River], but the former was so
         roughly handled by your nephew Fitz that it had to retire at
         night, &amp; the latter Stuck to their position. 
         <emph render="super">v</emph>The reports from within their
         lines are that the Cav[alr]y was to [have] Swept around to the
         Central and Fred[erick]s[burg] R.R.'s Burning depots &amp; cut
         us up generally Under cover of which their inf [antr]y was to
         Cross, but that we</p>
      <p>[second page of letter] 
         <lb/>had forestalled them &amp; they changed their minds. I
         presume it will be repeated in some shape the next fine day.
         As far as I learn Fitz Lee &amp; his Brigade behaved
         admirably, &amp; though greatly outnumbered Stuck to the enemy
         with a tenacity that Could be shaken off. The report of our
         scouts north of the Rappa[hannock] R[iver] place their
         strength at 7000. Stuart 
         <emph render="super">vi</emph>does not put it so high, while
         Fitz did not have with him more than 800. But I grieve over
         our noble dead! I do not know how I can replace the gallant
         Pelham. 
         <emph render="super">vii</emph>So Young So true So brave.
         Though stricken down in the dawn of manhood, his is the glory
         of duty done! Fitz had his horse shot under him but is safe.
         The news from the west is favourable &amp; at the South the
         blow is still impending over Charleston. 
         <emph render="super">viii</emph>When it falls it will be
         heavy, but if we do our duty I trust we shall not be crushed.
         "Through God we shall do great acts; &amp; it is He that shall
         tread down our enemies." 
         <emph render="super">ix</emph>Give much love to Sis Lucy &amp;
         "Mildred &amp; them." 
         <emph render="super">x</emph>Tell them I wish I Could get
         there. You must take them all out in the fields &amp; raise us
         quantities of Corn. We are in great need, both man &amp;
         beast. Set all the farmers to work. If they do not do better I
         shall have to call for aid upon our glorious women. I was glad
         to have seen George 
         <emph render="super">xi</emph>in Richmond. He has become a
