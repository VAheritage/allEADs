      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The career of Kenneth Winfred Thompson spans the fields of
         education, scholarship in foreign relations, and philanthropy.
         He was born on August 29, 1921 in Des Moines, Iowa, the son of
         Thor Carlyle and Agnes (Rorbeck) Thompson. His family later
         moved to La Crosse, Wisconsin, where he attended public
         schools. He graduated from Augustana College (Rock Island,
         Illinois) in 1943, earning the degree of A.B. in History.
         Further academic training was interrupted by service during
         World War II; Dr. Thompson served in both theaters of combat,
         earning the rank of Lieutenant. During those years, he met
         Miss Lucille (Bette) Bergquist, whom he later married. Their
         family eventually included three sons.</p>
      <p>Dr. Thompson's academic training was resumed at the
         University of Chicago, which awarded him the degree of Masters
         of Arts in 1948 and the Doctorate in Political Science and
         International Relations in 1950. He then served briefly on the
         staff of both the University of Chicago and Northwestern
         University before being appointed a consultant in
         international relations by the Rockefeller Foundation in
         October 1953.</p>
      <p>Promotion within the Foundation followed quickly. Dr.
         Thompson was appointed Assistant Director for the Social
         Sciences on April 6, 1955, Associate Director two years later,
         and Director in 1960. Finally, he was elected Vice President
         of the Rockefeller Foundation on October 1, 1961, succeeding
         Charles W. Cole, who had been appointed U.S. ambassador to
         Chile.</p>
      <p>Dr. Thompson is credited with having reorganized the major
         programs of the Rockefeller Foundation while serving as Vice
         President. At the same time, his activity as an author and on
         the platform was intense. During his years at the Rockefeller
         Foundation, he wrote or collaborated on eight books, published
         numerous articles, and was a much sought-for speaker on the
         subject of diplomacy and international affairs. He delivered
         the Riverside Memorial Lectures in 1958, the Lilly Endowment
         Lectures (Duke University) in 1959, the James Stokes Lectures
         (New York University) in 1962, and the Rockwell Lectures (Rice
         University) in 1965. All these lecture series were later
         published.</p>
      <p>Dr. Thompson was heavily influenced by and closely
         associated with the late Reinhold Niebuhr, whose ideas on
         morality in social relations were echoed by Dr. Thompson and
         applied to the realm of international relations. At the same
         time, Dr. Thompson held himself to be a political "realist"
         and was often at odds with his theoretical opponents, such as
         Hans J. Morgenthau.</p>
      <p>Dr. Thompson has been a member of the Council on Foreign
         Relations since 1955, and has been on the board of editors or
         a contributing editor to International Organization and
         Christianity Crisis since 1956. Although he relinquished the
         vice-presidency of the Rockefeller Foundation on January 1,
         1974, he continues to serve the Foundation as a part-time
         consultant on international affairs. He is presently Director
         of Higher Education for International Development for the
         Council on Higher Education (since 1974) and Commonwealth
         Professor of Government and Foreign Affairs, University of
         Virginia (since 1975).</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Kenneth W. Thompson Collection contains few signs of
         his day-to-day work for the Rockefeller Foundation. It
         provides a view into the workshop of a busy author and
         lecturer. The collection contains speeches, clippings, drafts
         of books, articles and reports, and correspondence relative to
         speaking engagements and problems of publication. Subjects
         covered include: international relations, diplomacy, higher
         education, foreign assistance, and Christian ethics.</p>
      <p>Significant correspondents in this collection include John
         C. Bennet, Joseph E. Black, Raymond B. Fosdick, Stephen D.
         Kertesz, Arthur S. Link, A. William Loos, Hans J. Morgenthau,
         Reinhold Niebuhr, and Dean Rusk.</p>
      <p>Single signed items by Hannah Arendt, Hubert H. Humphrey,
         Sir Harold Nicholson, and Arnold J. Toynbee also appear in
         this collection.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement>
      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>Following the original filing order, this collection has
         been arranged in six separate groups:</p>
      <p>Group I: Speeches, Lectures, and Symposia (1955-1973) The
         material in this group consists of a file of speeches and
         lectures delivered by Dr. Thompson or symposia to which he
         contributed, and is arranged chronologically by the date of
         the event. Where a fair copy of his presentation exists, it
         takes precedence in the file, followed by any surviving drafts
         in order of composition. Programs of the event and supporting
         correspondence then follow, arranged chronologically. On many
         occasions, Dr. Thompson spoke extemporaneously or from notes
         which have not survived. In those cases, the file for that
         address consists of correspondence only. Many of these
         speeches and lectures were later reworked and published. In
         most cases, a brief note appears in the file for each address
         in question, giving the details of its appearance in print.
         Further material dealing with publication will be found in
         Group II and IV. A cross reference file-card index to this
         material is filed in Box 25.</p>
      <p>Group II: Books (1955-1973) This group contains material
         related to books written, co-authored, or edited by Dr.
         Thompson, or to which he contributed. Following the original
         filing system, the material is arranged alphabetically by the
         title of each book. The file for each book begins with the
         most finished version of that book or portion of a book which
         has survived, whether reprint or typescript, followed by
         remaining drafts, in order of composition. In a few cases,
         where the text survives in clearly delineated stages (from
         draft to typescript to galley and page proof) that order has
         been followed. Correspondence related to publication then
         follows, with reviews and notes on distribution by Dr.
         Thompson concluding the file for each book. This group
         concludes with a set of published manuscripts also written by
         Dr. Thompson, together with rejected requests for articles and
         reviews. For further material, see Group VI.</p>
      <p>Group III: Publications--General (1952-1972) The material
         in this group consists of reports, articles, and conference
         proceedings written or contributed to by Dr. Thompson, usually
         as part of a committee. Following the original filing system,
         the material is first arranged alphabetically by organization.
         It is then followed by a set of papers relating to Dr.
         Thompson's activity as a reader of manuscripts for publishers
         or authors, also arranged alphabetically. For further
         material, see Group VI.</p>
      <p>Group IV: Articles (1952-1973) The material in this group
         consists of the texts and drafts of articles and reviews
         written by Dr. Thompson, together with correspondence
         pertaining to their publication. Following their original
         filing order, it is arranged alphabetically by journal
         title.</p>
      <p>Group V: Christianity and Crisis (1955-1971) This group
         consists of material related to Dr. Thompson's activity as
         contributing editor of the journal Christianity and Crisis, a
         position he has held since 1956. This journal was founded by
         the late Reinhold Niebuhr and his colleagues; Mr. Wayne H.
         Cowan was the editor-in-chief during the years covered in this
         collection. This file opens with a single folder of
         correspondence relating to administrative matters, followed by
         material pertaining to the publication of Dr. Thompson's own
         articles in that journal. That material is arranged
         chronologically by date of publication. The file for each
         article opens with a copy of the article in its most finished
         form, usually an issue of the journal in which it appeared,
         followed by whatever drafts that have survived and supporting
         correspondence.</p>
      <p>Group VI: Miscellany This group consists of oversize
         material, mainly galley-sheets of books written or edited by
         Dr. Thompson; photographs; and a file-card index (see Box 25)
         to the original files which was originally maintained by his
         secretaries.</p>
