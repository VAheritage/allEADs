        <p>The Butler copy of the Mitchell map was a gift to the

            Virginia on July 7, 1981.</p>

      <p>This hand-colored map depicts the two major engagements of
         the Bull Run Campaign of 1861, Blackburn's Ford on July 18,
         and First Bull Run (First Manassas) on July 21. It is a copy
         by E. Butler, a resident of Prince William County, Virginia,
         from the original "Sketch of the Country Occupied by the
         Federal and Confederate Armies on the 18th and 21st of July,
         1861," by Captain Samuel P. Mitchell of the First Virginia
         Regiment. Mitchell's map was published in Richmond, Virginia,
         by W. Hargrave White in 1861 and lithographed by F.W. Borneman
         of South Carolina and shows the dispositions of Federal and
         Confederate units before and during the two engagements, as
         well as major landmarks including Henry Hill, the Stone
         Bridge, Sudley Church, the Leesburg Road, and the Confederate
         Hospital. It should be noted that Butler's copy differs from
         the original map in several aspects particularly the inclusion
         of the sites of Butler family homes, leading to the
         supposition that Butler may have been an eye witness.</p>
