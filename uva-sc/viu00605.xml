      <p>
Henry James was born on April 15, 1843 in New York City into a wealthy family. His father, Henry James Sr. was one of the best-known intellectuals in mid-nineteenth-century America. In his youth James traveled back and forth between Europe and America. He studied with tutors in Geneva, London, Paris, Bologna and Bonn. At the age of 19 he briefly attended Harvard Law School, but preferred reading literature to studying law. James published his first short story, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">A Tragedy of Errors</title> two years later, and devoted himself to literature. In 1866-1869 and 1871-1872 he was a contributor to the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Nation and Atlantic Monthly</title>.
</p>
      <p>
From an early age James read the classics of English, American, French and German literature and Russian classics in translation. His first novel, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Watch And Ward</title> (1871), was written while he was traveling through Venice and Paris. After living in Paris, where he was contributor to the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New York Tribune</title>, James moved to England, living first in London and then in Rye, Sussex. During his first years in Europe James wrote novels that portrayed Americans living abroad. In 1905 James visited America for the first time in twenty-five years, and wrote <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Jolly Corner</title>.
</p>
      <p>
Among James' masterpieces are <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Daisy Miller</title> (1879), <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Portrait Of A Lady</title> (1881), <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Bostonians</title> (1886), <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">What Maisie Knew</title> (1897), and <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Wings Of The Dove</title> (1902). James considered <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Ambassadors</title> (1903) his most 'perfect' work of art. James's most famous short story is <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">The Turn of the Screw,</title> a ghost story in which the question of childhood corruption obsesses a governess. Although James is best known for his novels, his essays are now attracting a more general audience.
</p>
      <p>
Between 1906 and 1910 James revised many of his tales and novels for the New York edition of his complete works. His autobiography, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Small Boy And Others</title>, appeared in 1913 and was continued in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Notes Of A Son And Brother </title>(1914). The third volume, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Middle Years</title>, appeared posthumously in 1917. The outbreak of World War I was a shock for James and in 1915 he became a British citizen as a declaration of loyalty to his adopted country and in protest against the United States' refusal to enter the war. James suffered a stroke on December 2, 1915. He died three months later in Rye on February 28, 1916.

Also included are galley proofs and drafts of works about Henry James and his writings, such as <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Henry James at Home</title> by Montgomery Hyde; <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Lady Barberina and Other Tales</title> edited by Herbert Ruhm; <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">The Master</title> by Ford Madox Ford; and a poem dedicated to Henry James from Max Beerbohm and Edmund Gosse entitled <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">To Henry James.</title></p>
      <p>
In his extensive correspondence, James discusses his travels, the nature of his writings, his social appointments, and his ailments. Of special interest is his relationship with Violet Hunt, who was the long time mistress of Ford Madox Ford.  Henry James took great interest in Violet Hunt, and his letters to her are very flirtatious and intriguing. James's relationship with Violet Hunt temporarily ended when the scandal erupted over Ford Madox Ford's wife not granting a divorce to Ford while he remained involved with Hunt. In a letter dated November 2, 1909, James makes the difficult choice not to continue his relationship with Hunt until Ford's divorce is finalized.  
</p>
      <p>Henry James's correspondence with his close friend Hendrick Christian Anderson, an American sculptor, is extensive. James shows great admiration and love and interest in Anderson's work as well as lengthy criticism of it. James worries over Anderson's health, his attack of vertigo, and whether he is working too hard. James admires his youth, courage, and genius, and envies him his studio in Rome, even though his heart "bleeds" at the vision of him alone in that "wicked and indifferent" city.
</p>
      <p>Also of interest are James's letters to Mrs. Humphrey Ward. Most of his letters express critical acclaim for her works, although occasionally he gives negative criticism. He tells her that she is the only British romancer he can read.  In one long letter, James defends his method of writing fiction and discusses at great length the art of writing in general with examples from his various books.

              <p>Has taken a liberty and hastens to confess it.  He has given an introduction to him to an Englishman who has gone to stay in Paris: T. G. Child.  He is a young journalist (<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Pall Mall Gazette</title>, etc.) and though a bit of a Bohemian, and furthermore a Jew, but doesn't feel he is outraging the sanctity of his private life.  He is modest, honest, ingenious and excellent.  He knows no one in Paris where he has gone to work.  Hopes he can let him come and gossip once in a while.  Confident of his benevolence.  Hopes he has returned.  Believes he is philosophic.  For himself he is cockneyfied "to a degree," quite naturalized in London.  Suits him better than Paris, but hopes to visit the latter with the advent of summer. <num>#6251-c</num></p>

              <p>Received his letter of January 5. Has no prospect of being able to contribute anything more to the N.A.R. [<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">North American Review</title> ?]. Engaged in work which leaves him no time for writing "articles."  If he can do anything, will let him hear of it.  Afraid a comparison between English and American manners would be too invidious and ticklish a theme, especially while he continues to reside in England. <num>#6251-a</num></p>

              <p>Thanks for note that gratifies and alarms him.  Began to hear of vogue of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Bundle of Letters</title> in United States, and was glad as assumed demand was being supplied by Parisian with proportionate profit.  Heard from father that piratical Loring of Boston was about to bring out pamphlet edition of it.  Wrote <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Harper</title>'s to sell them the American copyright so they may bring out sole authorized edition.  Has not posted to <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Parisian</title> the permanent property of the thing.  Same proceeding with <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Daisy Miller</title> and <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The International Episode</title> which originally appeared in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Cornhill</title>.  There was an attempt to pirate them in the United States so he immediately sold copyright to <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Harper's</title>, who brought them out in little pamphlets which had a great circulation.  As Child says he has authorized American edition, afraid he is under impression that James did not reserve the copyright.  James understood he was not to publish simultaneously in American periodical, but not in the least that he was not subsequently to republish it.  As long as it could be sold simply in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Parisian</title> form, he was not happy to stay his hand.   Seems he should get what he can for it as a book, even though only 50 pages in paper cover.  Loring has committed legal misdemeanor in republishing it as a book without James's consent, anything published by James anywhere.  If <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Harper's</title> accepts his offer, they will proceed against him.  Complicates matter that Child's pamphlet should appear.  Write and tell him if Child's agent has gone to work before he can be stopped.  Thanks for his news.  Shall probably be in Paris around March 1. <num>#6251-c</num></p>

              <p>Understands situation.  His ultimate property in story would enable him to protect himself legally in America.  Assumed Child knew about copyrights there, which would for the moment ensure the sale of the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Parisian</title>.  James's belief is that as American owner of copyright, he could prosecute for any complete republication, even in a newspaper.  James should have inserted at top of the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Bundle</title> a notification that American copyright was reserved by the author.

              <p>Returning from Naples, finds her note offering him a pleasure which he is sorry to have missed.  Hopes she lost no time in seeking a substitute for office she invited him to fill.  Should have been happy to meet distinguished foreigners.  Has been abroad since March 1, and is enjoying that peace of mind which Italy alone can give.  Excited by the constant bulletins about liberal victories, the magnitude of which quite exceed his dreams.  Hopes the party will make a better figure in office than it has lately made in opposition!  Finds Italy more Italy than ever, almost a compensation for loss of London hospitalities.  Hopes to return in a few weeks to make the acquaintance of her new home, and her daughter. <num>#6251-a</num></p>

              <p>Sitting looking down on picturesque port of Genoa.  It is Italy!  Local color in which the nose is as conscious as the eyes.  It smells picturesque!  Has been staying at San Remo, after a fortnight in Paris.  San Remo is a lovely coast: a supportable form of modified martyrdom, which he feels as he grows older modern travel to be.  San Remo more charming even than Provence: a sort of Italian Falmouth.  Hope he is happy and healthy, and enjoying Cornish spring, which much be flowery enough.  Even in Falmouth he must have jumped at the sound of the horrible Russian bombs.  Isn't he glad he is not an Emperor?  The thing is too devilish, and he doesn't believe in reforms that begin in deforming.  Exempt from Ireland the last two weeks.  They know nothing of it in Genoa, and he reads the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Times</title> in a hazy, dreamy manner.

              <p>Meant to send him a greeting, but America isn't a land of leisure, but it is to a certain extent that of pleasure.  Wants to give him a few of his novels, and asks for as many as possible of his own.  If he were to relate his adventures and impressions, he wouldn't know where to begin.  His adventures chiefly impressions, as he has not been traveling extensively.  Spent a month in Boston and on in New York.  Rest of time in Washington, D. C., the most interesting of the three.  Found friends the Adams's, whose agreeable house is one of the features of Washington.  They like Washington better than London because they are, vulgarly speaking, someone here, and are nothing in his complicated kingdom.  He and Lady Clark the first Europeans they asked about.  Everyone genial and friendly in D.C., and he, too, is "someone" there, and it will be a sacrifice of vanity when he returns to England.  But he loves his London better than his vanity and will turn up there in May.  Things are fast in D.C., and change in the last ten years incredible.  Increase of civilization, wealth, knowledge, taste, etc. is striking.  Won't answer for what the county may become in 100 years hence.  New York is a brilliant city, but it takes a fortune to enjoy it.  Nothing under a million is called a great fortune now.  Believes Washington is place in the world where money or its absence matters least.  It is informal, familiar, essentially social and conversational, enormously big and yet extremely provincial, indefinably ridiculous yet agreeable.  Only place in America where there is no business, where an air of leisure hangs over the streets, where one walks slowly and doesn't look preoccupied.  Hasn't seen his minister, Sackville-West, but he appears much liked, and he has a most attractive daughter.  Where is he?  Hasn't forgotten his scheme to sail to the Cape.  Is he rubbing shoulders with the Kaffirs and tossing on a Southern ocean?  James is homesick for the chimney pots of London.  His sojourn in D.C. is an exile mitigated by optimism.  Tell him of Boers and Kaffirs. <num>#6251-n</num></p>

              <p>Speaks of missing the honored shores of old England.  His organ of affection is not paralyzed as is fortunate in a country and city which frequently presents that wonderful product of civilization, the American Girl, which flourishes to advantage.  Hopes South African voyage will be deferred till it is too late to be discreet.  Bayswater seems better adapted to his eminently social nature than the Southern Ocean.  Washington D.C. is the latitude of Palermo.  It is the possibilities and not the actualities that are striking.  In 50 years it will probably be in addition to nation's capital a country of 100 million, and one of the most charming winter resorts.  A good deal to be done, but western Congressmen won't vote for such luxuries as improving D. C.  Dined with Mr. Blaine, the late Secretary of State.  He is in official mourning [for Garfield's death?], and the White House is shrouded in gloom.  There is something dramatic in solitary individual lifted into great position by a murder in which he may hear the hovering of the ghosts of Lincoln and Garfield.  Has he seen Meredith? <num>#6251-n </num></p>

              <p>Often thought of him in Scottish Highlands while he is looking at the Paris Opera through rainfall.  Speaking of him to John Hays, or with the genial King who convokes them to gorgeous feasts when he is not buying tapestries for Mademoiselle de Pompadour or philandering with Ferdinand Rothschild, who appears unable to live without him.  Paris is same old Paris, and he is fond of it.  Has been wandering about the Provinces since middle of September.  Paris is a good place to work if you know the theatres are dull, restaurants ruinous, the streets all dirt.  People pretend to feel very insecure.  Government shaky, and lives from day to day.  With these drawbacks, Paris is delightful. <num>#6251-n </num></p>

Youth will appreciate anything he may do for him. Thanks him in advance.  James will sail for England August 22.  Must spend summer in United States.  Enjoys the light and heat which are a revelation of genial season he has not beheld for many years.  He has a cool home all to himself, takes a dozen baths a day, etc. and scribbles a good deal, having contracted to write 2 books.  Will send when done.  Homesick for London.

              <p>What a dear note from Alphonso [Daudet].  Thanks Child for translating as his French had deteriorated in all his British years.  Values his compliment, but it is a terrible thing to live up to.  His account of Huntington interesting.  Sorry about his illness.  Can't his friend Clemenceau do something for him?  Or is he exclusively occupied with the national bladder?  Tell Huntington that he hopes he not only collects the greatest, but recollects the small.

She rendered him an excellent service in making him acquainted with Juliana Horatia's little tale.  It is a genuine masterpiece, touching beyond anything he has read in a long time.  Subject is lovely, and the lightness and grace of touch without effort or mannerism place the thing quite apart.  Should like to send her something to testify to his sentiments about <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Jackanapes</title>, so will send a little book of his just out.

              <p>His letter was a stimulating whiff of Latin civilization, and constitutes one of the occasions when, fond as he is of dirty old London, he envies him.  He anguishes the theatric poverty of life in London.  Difficult to believe Sarah [Bernhardt] is "among the greatest."  She struck him as wanting in interest at times, even bad and false and weak.  She has, however, wonderful things in her.  Grieves over poor Huntington's condition.  Is Goncourt going to publish letters, and are Flaubert's letters coming out?  What is divine diminutive Alphonse [Daudet] doing? <num>#6251-c</num></p>

              <p>Expects to hear everything over with Huntington.  Moral climate of Paris strikes him as so unpleasant.  Long discourse on "the little thing" [Daudet].  Poor, dear, fascinating, but rather crapulous little thing!  There is in all this a strange smell of decadence!  Such an interesting, exciting moment to be in England.  People talk about George Eliot's life, just published in three fat volumes by her second husband.  Full of deep decency and strenuous labor, and a comfortable English prosperity what is not alluded to is the scandalous Bohemian fact that she lived 25 years conjugally with G. H. Lewes without being married.  Dreams of going to Paris, but has unfinished work to conclude. <num>#6251-a</num></p>

              <p>They are both apparently gloomy, but Child's gloom is relieved by the acquisition of charming works of art whereas James's is unrelieved.  Doesn't know Frank Harris at all.  He is a brutal, young adventurer who was a hotel waiter in America, and has lately married and has a house on Park Lane, spending winters in Rome.  Virtual editor of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Fortnightly</title> is Reverend John Verschoyle, an odd but energetic Irish parson who pitchforks the magazine together.  Shall recall Child was a former contributor.  James wrote a long article on Maupassant for March number; will do a Pierre Loti for May, and then a Goncourt and Flaubert.  Can't recall any literary or artistic news that will surround the British capital with a halo.  There is to be a great new gallery: a schism from the Grosvenor.  Is there a III Journal of Goncourt's?  He has promised to write on it for the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Fortnightly</title>.

              <p>Really a pretty present, and groups brings back happy day and delightful people.  Glad an honorable accident placed him there in a sympathetic trio with her mother and her.  Seems to hear Mr. G. say something ingenious regarding the Hittites or the moral beauty of the Welshman-conformists.  She must have been shocked by Matthew Arnold's death as all have been, and particularly glad of the day he had lately spent with her in so happy a mood.  James went to funeral.  The place of burial being a charming, old English nook, but was spoiled by dreary weather.  Friendliest remembrance to Lady de Rothschild. <num>#6251-y</num></p>

              <p>He wrote magnificent letter.  Hasn't answered as didn't think it fair to send back the ball so soon.  Has brave scruples writing him even now, and so only if he takes no notice of his barely decipherable words.  His various communications interested him in only most irresponsible and irresponsive way.  James is writing in odd hour of visit to the continent.  Absent from London for six months or so, three of which he will spend in Paris.  Wrote to Gilder answering his query about James's promised but procrastinated Daumier.  Shall have it as soon as James gets back to London.  Afraid it will not be as soon as then that he shall bask in luxurious moral consciousness of copyright.  Sorry not feasible to treat silly Lord Sackville's silly innocence in United States as if it were only amusing.  Would have finished him with own government.  There is something so ugly in Bayard's coming round to a pretended horror to please the clumsy, blundering monster.  Johnson's scale continues to stagger and almost scare him.  He is a profuse periodical.  Hopes all enterprises have brought rewards he looked for.  Afraid he hasn't any London news after 15 months there without absence, except that [Edmund] Gosse has, since his father's death, discovered he is an American of high and historical degree.  Johnson ought to raise his salary.  Hopes he doesn't have to be ill to come to Europe, for he desires him to return. <num>#6251-a </num></p>

              <p>Address takes up one half of paper.  This is rest and peace and coolness and vast violet views.  Too constant perspiration to write.  Wrote Mrs. Curtis from Siena, which was delightful.  Returned to Florence, and started off again in quest of out of the way picturesque, but heat intense and inns dirty and he was ready to collapse at Perugia.  Back to Florence until end of the month.  Tells of his inn, which was a convent.  Worth his while to visit; it is a good sort of place for Mrs. Curtis.  James contends a man may worry through an English winter with a few precautions, but to face an English summer, the stoutest heart, constitution, and boots are required.  Glad they are seeing London life.  Mrs. Jack has asked him to the Barbaro.  Expects to be back by August 15. <num>#6251-ag </num></p>

              <p>Tells her where he is living, and that he cannot go abroad as sister too ill to leave her.  As years go on, he gets less of his beloved Italy.  Life is so damnably short; always waiting for make-up years.  They will certainly go to India, as they are out for all adventures.  He always supposed India the greatest of all earthly impressions.  Even the banality of English illusion to it has not dulled his curiosity.  Envies most Prince [Ralph?].  Apropos of Princes is their incurable vulgar frivolity, as displayed in Baccaret scandal.  James finds Mrs. Orr's biography of Robert Browning [<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Life and Letters of Robert Browning</title>] dismal.  What sticks out is that he had little life apart from his work, which drained him of distinction, but not of strength.  Longs for Venice.  Longs to hear that the worry of lawsuit has bored itself to death.  Tells of when and how his drama will be produced in London.  Will have as his heroine, Miss Robins, an American who made an immense hit in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Hedda Gabler</title>. <num>#6251-ag </num></p>

              <p>Called to Germany week ago by death of American friend.  Will return to the peace and obscurity of De Vere Gardens.  Delighted he is better.  Can't do much with the Germans, who are somehow not in his line.  One must really know them or leave them alone.  They are ugly and mighty.  Lots of future, but an intolerable present.  Likes [Henry] Adams, but suffers from his monotonous pessimism.  He is what he should like to have been: a man of wealth and leisure, able to satisfy all his curiosities.  Wishes he could have had at Tillyponie his old friend, John La Farge, one of the most extraordinary and agreeable of men.  He has been traveling with Adams, and he wonders how either could fail to murder the other. <num>#6251-n</num></p>

              <p>Glad to hear from him even though painful duty devolves on him. His sending Marchesa Theodoli's  little proverb and his plea for it do a real honor to the high principal of sympathy within him.  The greater pity that the case should not be intrinsically for him.   Virtue never deserves attention: it only deserves paradise.  Madame T. may get a slice of latter for her little play, but she would be ill-advised to bid for the former.  The little art is much more difficult and special than she can suspect.  These would not be a ghost of a chance that this little piece or anything like it should reach the footlights.  No woman should ever write a play because it hasn't the scenic quality.   There is no chance for one act things.  Hates to have to say such things.  The lady's novel was very pretty, and she will do that sort of thing more profitably.  Glad of his reappearance.  Talks of the Swiss and the French, and his early summer at Lucerne. <num>#6251-a</num></p>

              <p>No good news from him.  Gosse assures him no use in offering any publication of a manuscript less than 50,000 words.  His manuscript contains at the most 15,000 words. English magazines want 6-7,000 words.  Slender physique of his little offshoot a grave obstacle to place it.  Suggests how he can add dialogues, etc.  Nothing would induce him to shoot with Brewster save reflection he would kill Brewster first.  Charming of him to see something in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Lessons of the Master</title>.

Hears the demand for seats is in great excess of the supply.  Advises that he write to the box office for a stall and then he will back up his name for preference to be given to him.

There are hundreds of pressing applicants unserved.  But will be glad if he sat in his box if he will say "Yea."  James will keep a place for him.  James will not be there as he shall be much too nervous.  But Mrs. Charles Lawrence will be there.  He only needs to say at the door "Show me to Mr. James's box please," and he will be taken.

              <p>Sorry about the [Duke] question, but it was his fault.  When James first declined he has seen her so little.  Now that she has been giving James a chance the void has been made up, and have felt rather prepared or inspired.  She has been acting here for three weeks very exquisitely.  James, though, does not want to write about her, for he is woefully weary of the all-invasive theatre, with its cheapness of criticism, its overestimated art, a vulgarity of air, and is delighted to surrender the task to someone who does want do deal with it.  Very sorry that he can't write the little article.  Criticizes the nature of plays, of the ridiculous abandonment of all proposition or perspective in the worship of the actors and actresses, and in English speaking countries the total absence of dramatic authors.  In France the actors are kept in their place.  Simply cannot write article for all sorts of reasons. <num>#6251-as</num></p>

              <p>For the present he is very far off.  Established in that obscure corner for the summer since May 1.  Nearly three hours from town.  Much tied to a belated job, so cannot jump at the chance to see her.  Regrets the privation; doesn't know when he shall risk his neck or his philosophy in London.  Think of him in a vicarage.  Obliged to give up his delicious little perch.  Needs all her prayers.  Trusts she is painless and peaceful.  Taken the vicarage at Rye for August.

Hopes November brings her back to town.  Her being so much better wandered into his solitude, and made it flutter.  Sees Sir [George] Tressaday is at his door.  If she listens hard enough she may catch echo of intellectual revel of his visit.  Has promised two shortish novels of the pot-boiling order essentially for which serious work had to be interrupted.  He has done three, but that only swells the smallness.  From the matchless pride of "Stocks," pity him.  <num>#6251-a</num></p>

Sorry no photograph of her.  Discusses her attributes.  She was a veritable artist; volume is extraordinarily fine.  Doesn't know when he is coming to Rome.  Come to Rye.  Now in Paris at Zola's side.  Finds Zola really a hero and thinks his original letter one of the most courageous things ever done. <num>#6251-a  </num></p>

To give her some sign of his reading the beautiful book.  It is already in Mrs. Green's hands.  Favorable pages about his admiration for her great power to take hold of the reader.  The book is done in a way to run the chance of being pronounced the finest of the lot.  He is too special and too technical of a reader: he sees a novel, if he can read it at all, artistically conditioned.  Gives his own comments on her characters.  The fine, free, high way she walks over the big question, Laura's question, does her the greatest intellectual honor. <num>#6251-a</num></p>

              <p>James defends his method of writing fiction and discusses at length the art of writing.  There are as many cases as you like of presenting a thing by "going behind" as many forms of consciousness as you like: all Dickens, Balzac, Thackeray, Tolstoy, save when they use the autobiographical dodge, are huge illustrations of it.  His own immortal works, for that matter, are recognizable instances of all the variations.  He "goes behind" in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Princess Casassima, The Bostonians, The Tragic Muse</title>, just as he does but singly in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The American</title> or <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Masie [What Massie Knew]</title>.  Appearance of doing it a little in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Awkward Age</title>.  She labors under three mistakes that distressed him and resents her attributing judgments to him too imbecile.  She says he says there is only one general; he protests he has never had any difference with her.  Does see what she means in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Pictures d'Islande</title>.  He sees it as a beautiful crystal clear example of a single relation.  Thought her process with <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Eleanor</title> was already refined and defined as "dramatic."  Does differ if she means picture can get any objective unity from any source but from the personality of the author.  More about her <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Eleanor</title> and her <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Lucy</title>.

              <p>Glad he got missive.  Good news of his escape from Rome being in sight.  Will make him welcome when right day comes.  Has struck up tremendous intimacy with dear little Conte Alberto.  He is the first object his eyes greet in the morning and the last at night.  Sooner or later many will be struck by him.  Remember him to the Elliots.  Wrote them after vile earth-shock.  Gathers it didn't shatter him or anything that is his.  <num>#6251 </num></p>

              <p>Found her letter after returning from 50 hours in Kent County, and thanks her for sign of remembrance and sympathy.  Not in torrid town.  Back from Italy three weeks ago after four months there, and hadn't been in town for 13 months.  He is a tenant or a traitor; Lamb House is more or less Bowery.  He is far from Wimbledon.  So long abroad that pressing work had him by the throat on his return. Includes brief description and note, "Tink" to Gilbert, 1946 May 29. <num>#6251-y</num></p>

He overcharges: pitches the key of appreciation to his sense too high.  No one cares any more for the value of the shade, and the beauty of this region is conspicuously a case of that.

Sorry to lose him when they walked sadly to station.  Missed out of all proportion to three little days they spent together.  Reminisces over bicycle trip, etc.  Hopes to take studio in hand so it will be ready for him as an artistic habitation.  Rye is not sculpturesque or an inspiration, but what's good for the man is good for the artist.  Tell him as it shapes itself his weird American story.  May it be good to him! <num>#6251</num></p>

His portrait busts will be wanted as people become aware of them.  Make them aware, then wait.  Will go to London for 2-3 months.  Let his apartment for pressing financial reasons.

Has had a worried winter, wholly spent in the house.  Pats him tenderly on the back as his fate hangs fire.  It's when nothing happens that one is most at ease.  Goes to London for fortnight, then home for long go of tranquility.  That's the only thing that makes life tolerable.

Talks of going to London, then home, not to Italy, etc.  Thinks of him with hope in the big, kind, ugly country.  Think of James as peaceful and productive for sitting close to home.

Stick to Newport and his family, until he can go it alone, and then come to James and he will give him a further lift.  Family duties and anxieties have been heavy on James.

The grey years gather; he feels his loss and gain if he had been free.  Saw Paris of these months as a positive hell of worry and oppression for him.  Rejoices he had three weeks in May.  Asks him to put his record and impressions in order so he may have cognition of them.  His letter exhales complexity and obscurity of trouble and he may hold out assurance of help.

He has been out of the current for a long time, and feels as if his oldest friend would have been excusable to exclude him from all earthly affairs.  It's humane of her to give him another chance.  Kind of her to ask after his brother who has been little with him this summer as he has been at Nanheim cures, etc.  He is better and has been able to write most of his first course of Gifford lectures.  The second course he has had to renounce.  His sister-in-law was with him much of the latter half of the summer.  She abandoned the idea of returning to the United States for two months to see her other children.  His summer has been a deluge of family, and he has not stirred from home.  How rich her existence, how numerous her contacts, how perfect her machinery.

Delightful for her to have the pretext for another month in Rome!  Impossible for him to join his brother there as he proposes.  He will go to town January 1 until May, and will see her and let her tell him all about the play.  Rejoices for her in an associate as charming and literary, etc. as Julian S. <num>#6251-a</num></p>

              <p>Has had two impulses:  to write to her soon as he heard of her father's death; and to let a little time pass.  He had just begun <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Eleanor</title> and was absorbing it. Writes about parental extinctions.  When he finished book he had words to utter to heal wounds rather than to be harsh to them.  Her father had the serenity of his accomplished age, after many mutations, and assuredly after seeing himself magnificently fulfilled by her.  She can think of the pleasure and pride she must have filled his life with.  Hopes he read <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Eleanor</title>.  He never met him, but was impressed with his published personal recollections, and what a date was his death in the Arnold family cycle!  Thanks for her letter on <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Soft Side</title>, a little bundle of sordid potboilers which he is forced to write, because there is no demand for anything else so he has done another volume of similar snippets, even though he is old enough to know better.  He reads as much fiction as he can read.  Took liberty in inordinate degree with <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Eleanor</title>.  Many compliments on book, and feels it the highest tribute he can pay.  He can't criticize though he could re-write!  The thing is infinitely delightful and distinguished, and that's enough.  Won't pretend book hasn't a weakness, a rather grave one, or she will doubt his intelligence.  Goes into detail: <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Lucy vs. Eleanor</title>, etc.  He recognizes that not a solitary reader or critic will have made his criticism, and when a book is beautiful, nothing does matter. <num>#6251-a</num></p>

              <p>Most kind her letter, etc. and it needs all his courage not to be responsive, but it is impossible for him to go abroad this spring.  He is not free, as he is bound to an unfinished and belated book on his hands.  Also his brother and his wife arrive from Italy at Easter to come down with him for a month.  Talked with Mrs. Peter Harrison who knows her villa well, and she made his mouth water.  Has liveliest appreciation of her remarks on <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Sacred Fountain</title>.  Says the book isn't worth discussing.  It was a remarkably accidental one, and the merest <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">joux d'esprit</title>.  Started as a short story and never stopped.  Tried to make it a consistent joke, but it was taken seriously.  It's doubtless disgraceful, but it's the last he shall ever make.  Forgive his weariness over his deadly backward book, which isn't a joke, unless he doesn't know the difference. <num>#6251-a</num></p>

They found Hans delightful in Rome.  A lot about his <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Lincoln</title> and traveling all over Italy.  Discusses various parts of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Lincoln</title> and his approval.  A seated Lincoln shocks him for he always stood tall.  Suggests improvements.  He is more placid than one's own image and memory.  Benevolent, deeply troubled, altogether tragic.

              <p>Too ill to write sooner in London, but now convalescent at home.  Didn't want to cruelly worry him.  Now James' weak arms can fold Anderson close.  Has gone through death to death in his long life, to know how all that we are and have, all that is best within us, our genius, our imagination, our passion become opens gates to suffering, to being flooded.  James tells Anderson, "Let yourself go and live now as a lacerated mutilated lover, with your grief, your loss, your sore unforgettable consciousness."  Possess them and let them possess you and life will still hold you in her arms.  Beautiful and unspeakable Anderson's account of his relation to Andreas : sacred beyond tears.  James wishes he had known Andreas, an admirable, loveable boy.  Andreas is all Anderson's now: With Anderson's patience, genius and courage, things will come back to him. <num>#6251 </num></p>

              <p>Newspapers lie a great deal, but prompted her to write.  Thinks James is working through nightmare.  His book delayed, but will be out soon, and will send her a copy.  Shall seek her out at earliest occasion after pandemonium of the present has subsided.  Thanks her for her circular account of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Monna Vanna</title> which he shall not see enacted.  Shall read with disappointment.  James  loves Maeterlinck: a beautiful mind.  Strikes him as treated with strange heaviness, as if to make up for rare temerity of his old beautiful things.  But he blasphemes.  Wished he could go to a performance with her. <num>#6251-o</num></p>

              <p>Blow to learn Anderson is passing by so near James and not stopping.  Waiting for Anderson's September visit.  Natural that Anderson should be making for Paris.  With Anderson's mother and brother he can work in as few complications as possible.  James wishes he might have seen them, too.  Wishes he could say he could get to Italy this winter.  Yearns to go for a long stay and pick Anderson up and take him to places he wants to see.  Would like to hear about Anderson's time in America.  Hopes he has been able to put something solid under his feet and something bright before his eyes.  He must march to glory with lengthening strides.  May his mother find comfort in being with him and helped by him. <num>#6251</num></p>

              <p>Thanks for her generous letter.  Thinks he sees faults of his too voluminous fiction.  When a thing is done, he sees nothing but the faults: three or four major ones.  None are the objection she raises.  Agrees subject is a poor one.  The thing is essentially a drama, like everything he does.  Can't come to her as not possible to leave home.

              <p>Believes his letter moves him, and is the most beautiful letter he ever received from any man.  Accompanied as it is by an exquisite intelligence as well as by the penetrating cordiality of affection, inspiring and inflaming the sympathy with which he reads him.  James writes out of deep and dire complexity of that sentient machine on which he put his unerring finder: to be encased in which is to be forever mortally isolated.  Gives him a chance to say "think of him so, always, and he will think of him tenderly."  He adds to his wish and to his need to lead the life of his genius, and he shall, somehow, while there's a rag left of him, thanks to him.  How deeply interesting he is on his change of place, expressing a frankness and fullness which he has never used, which James has always desired.  Fullerton's cause is not the losing one: he is kept for great things.  He'll bring Spain back into the family.  He'll repay the debt to Columbus.  But it takes him horribly away.  Thinks of him with a free mind in Madrid, and tries to think of some day coming to see him there, which will be his only chance to see him.  Goes to see George Meredith because he promised the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Atlantic</title> to write a paper on him.  His <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Cornhill</title> thing will reach him, and delights to expect it.  Sends him his Flaubert and Balzac introductions, but what the Devil will he do with them?  Pack them on the bottom of books he has stored in Paris.  They will have ultimate bibliographical value. <num>#6251-m</num></p>

              <p>Has been silent since last letter.  Didn't want to write so he would have to answer so soon.  He would think of him more if he did not write.  Anderson wrote of being peacefully settled in work and having his mother conveniently established with him.  Had been comforted to know she would break his solitude.  Haunted all winter by vision of his lovely labors and lonely misery.  Hopes mother is happy.  James is there where he left him and will go to London for 3-4 months in January.  Looks forward to their future time together, but has little hope of being out of England.  Always yearning for Italy.  Blesses his work: he is a heroic young master of the grand style.  Sounds horribly beautiful and big and difficult, but he will know that in the interest and the honors.  Sending his ponderous book since he so gallantly asked for it, but not necessary to plough through it. <num>#6251 </num></p>

              <p>Obliged for her ferocious letter; she has a "rum" collection of places for resort.  Lamb House, on her departure, relapsed into ascetic gloom.  Her companion of genius to passenger on "liner" to his cabin and his "hold" luggage is very brilliant and he does agree with this difference.  Genius gets at its own luggage in the hold perfectly but it doesn't get at captain's or first mate's in their mysterious retreat.  Now, William of Stratford [Shakespeare] had no luggage in any part of ship, corresponding to much of wardrobe sported in plays. <num>#6251-o</num></p>

Anderson's reward for a heroic summer should be a liberal taste of northern freshness.  All will be worth three times as much for returning there if they breathe their air for a few weeks.

              <p>Anderson's letter gives James great joy that James knows Anderson to be out of the ovens of the Seven Hills.  Glad to have confirmation of his reaching England.  James asks Anderson to give him notice of when to expect Anderson so James can adapt his activities.  Speaks of romantic Italy and how James has been cheated of it.  His losses will be made up by Anderson's talk. <num>#6251</num></p>

However it is doubtless to do them when one is inspired as M. [D'Asray] cordially is, and with every reason to be.  All a mystery and everything but his predestined apotheosis with the whole thing.

Slowly felt better, and book is intrinsically best he has written, in spite of a fearful though patched over fault or weakness in it, which no one has noticed, and which nothing will induce him ever to reveal.  It is meritorious for its conformation and composition.  Was written 4 years ago, and finds himself away and "off" from it.

              <p>Apology for not writing.  Difficult to write to Italy because it always makes him melancholy, so he dodges it.  Winter of her sister's death, and its circumstances.  Takes his passage for August 24 to the States.  Expects to spend 6-8 months there, not in New York or Boston, but if possible in California.  28 years ago he spent a year there, and 32 years ago he spent two years there.  Always thinks of it as his original departure for Europe.  In 1869 Europe was intensely romantic to him, but that has all changed, and his own country has become so from strangeness.  England has lost its old color.  Will America have taken a new color?  Doubtless not, but goes for urgent practical reason.  Has spent 7 weeks in London and stays another month.  Still thinks yearningly of Florence.  <num>#6251-ag</num></p>

Perhaps, by some miracle, he could come out and spend eight or ten weeks peacefully and restfully with James in these quiet and secure conditions?  It would be a joy to have him come.

Pathetic to see him thrown alone on that fierce battlefield or tropical artistic wilderness of Paris.  Rejoices in his sending him to visit James.  Arthur's resemblance brought Anderson back to his side.  Anderson encased in work, but he mustn't pay too much for it.   Asks him if there is any chance of his coming to England this summer.  James goes to America for autumn, winter and spring.  Arthur tells him Anderson has a proposal to go there and teach, and hopes he is thinking of it as he shall be able to see him there and help him.  James going there partly for indispensable money.   Talks about Anderson's vertigo: probably from long foodless hours of work.  Used to be so with him.   Has he any small photos of himself and his new figures?  Yearns to see them and him before he goes.  Hopes for a cessation of his physical ills. <num>#6251 </num></p>

              <p>Thanks him for touching little letter which brings tears to his eyes.  S. S. Howells and his daughter have been with him since he left.  Phil should never doubt of James' inability to take his hand from Phil's shoulder (where he laid it originally when he was almost too young to keep himself) or doubt either of an indisposition to that act quite equal to the inability.  Phil always will remind him of old, beautiful days and hours of a great affection or a cherished image.  These things come closer again when James is with him, and he feels the breath of them, bountifully, when he was there.  Very affectionately yours. <num>#6251-bb</num></p>

              <p>Waited to thank him for letter, but it was saddening with its tale of overwork and overstrain because there have been elements of uncertainty and tension and confusion in his own situation.  His feet now firm enough to ask if it's in his power to get to him for the winter.  He would be delighted.  James leaves for the United States the last week of August.  Always full of tender and affectionate welcome in his own quiet way.  Anderson's taking a long, costly journey sticks in his crop.   He could cherish him for 3-4 weeks.  The change would make for his comfort and well being.  Thinks of him with anxiety and commiseration in the fiery furnace of Rome.  <num>#6251</num></p>

James likes to know she is an intelligent and perceptive reader of his poor distillations.  In the case of W.W.G. book from very bare commentary material made the thing a feat of ingenuity and almost literary heroism.  There was little material on hand for a real record.  Later in winter hopes for a pilgrimage to California, and shall perhaps have the pleasure of seeing her. <num>#6251-a </num></p>

              <p>Three days ago saw his sister in Boston.  Thanks Anderson for the tender letter which he repeatedly re-read.  Miserably mute because of all delays, shortcomings and embarrassments in America.  Scapegoat of his conscience from day to day and hour to hour.  Talks of Mrs. Andreas and her answers to questions about Anderson in Boston.  What a shock to learn of Anderson's heart trouble and troubled pilgrimage to Turin specialist.  Hopes Mrs. Andreas' report isn't too rose-coloured.  Work gently and sanely.  Put on brake and twiddle his thumbs.  Wishes he could lay his hands, soothing, perhaps healing, on Anderson in the quality of their pressure.  Mrs. Andreas showed him a photo album of Anderson's recent life and work.  Pictures quickened his conception of his work's greatness and beauty.  If he thought he was killing himself, James would come and smash a few dozen statues, smash them for brazen idols feeding on his flesh to clear the air.  Photos bring tears to his eyes.  Wanted to borrow the volume.  Talks of the beauty of New England, and says he wants to see the rest of the country with some literary purpose until late in the spring, if he doesn't break down from weariness and nostalgia.  New York affects him fearfully, and full of all sorts of homesickness, but interested, too; everyone is extraordinarily kind.   Holds him in love.  Keep up his heart and swing his hammer wide, and they will know good days together again. <num>#6251</num></p>

              <p>His brother, Professor James, indicated to him their inquiry as to his whereabouts.  Doesn't wonder they are bewildered at his failure to stay in New York.  Hopes to settle himself there by the first of the month.  Delayed by having a dreadful condition in his hands which has lasted a month, blighted his days and nights and breaking into his work.  Worst is over, and he is promised liberation and will go to 21 East 11th Street New York until February 10. <num>#6251-a</num></p>

Hard to hear of his continued attacks of vertigo.  Hard to think of his solitary voyage, being affected by the heart and that James might fail to see him.  Sails for England July 4.  Will be in Boston in late June.  Told of his plans to sail from Genoa early in summer.  Shall be back in Lamb House July 15.  His monuments are over the head of all the "stupids" there, but there are individuals who are not impenetrable and hopes that for them he is bringing large pleasure.

              <p>Answering his questions on his preparation of bibliography of James's writings.  He abhors bibliography, and his principle is to find it impossible to give them any furtherance.  His unearthing early unsigned reviews in the <num>Atlantic</num> and <num>North American Review</num> only fills him with the bitterness of woe.  Of article contributed to <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Balleon Post</title>, Boston, 1871, he has no recollection.  "<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Cousin et Cousine</title>," 1876, must have been a translation of "Four Meetings," he is at sea about them.  His good will almost brings to his eyes tears of remonstrance for misapplied effort.  His asking where "Transatlantic Sketches" appeared makes him wonder why and how any such wretched little question can matter to anyone.  Helps no intelligence to feed itself on such twaddle; millions of miles removed from any real critical play of mind.  With note from Ned [Berkeley] to Waller [Barrett], n.d. <num>#6251-aa</num></p>

Grim years pass.  His time in America was to his profit and gain.   Non-communication difficult, as weighty things about his priority, work, plans, fountain must be discussed.  Could have talked beautifully and intimately there [Rye] but they have to wait too long.

              <p>Can't keep his hands off him.  His sense of wonder in reading his little French volume so insists on overflowering.  Finds him strangely interesting.  Lost in admiration of his so cunning, so <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">savante</title> French form: it is performance of a brilliant and difficult feat, brought off so remarkably;  as well as the way of so intimate a visitation of the marvelous old France of which it has been his own pathetic fate to see so little.  Will dream to make up for that.  Reading has always been experience and when it is reading him truly, it has been charming for him.  Was going to say he doesn't see why he did it in French.  Must be exquisite intellectual sport so ingenuous with the matter.  No readers save for poor solitary James.  Envies his equipment of knowledge and references.  Wants to turn him out to fresh fields and renew his vibrations and secretions.  Unfortunate that here is but one history and romantic France.  What would become of his English, for which James has a sneaking fondness?  His work is a gallant tribute to his French sympathies.  Would he like a small volume of a couple of lectures James delivered in the United States?  Wants to send something.   Hasn't been published there yet. <num>#6251-m</num></p>

              <p>Autograph note by Henry James on verso of envelope. Thanks for note and photographs of group.  Speaks of this, his fine contributions to this interminable series.  Criticizes "hands" and "backs" and how to improve them.  Wishes he could stand in Anderson's crowed workshop and discuss these things.  Patience, that will happen.  Says no word of his head or his health.  Only hopes he is exempt from physical woe. <num>#6251</num></p>

              <p>Talks of Anderson's letters and why James delays answering them.  Says recent letter with Kodak views of self and family cheered him because they tell of Anderson's health, energy and might, so that James wonders at Anderson and is proud of him.  His production is prodigious and heroic, very beautiful and interesting.  Talks of men and ladies flaunting their bellies and bottoms and other private affairs in the face of the day.  Is there any American possibility to laud them?  Knows how it distresses him, but pays tribute to his noble imagination, his wealth of composition, combination, creation, and splendid sense of the body and the members.  Detailed criticism follows of faces, hair, legs, etc. of the figures.  Prefers to dwell on things of great beauty that Anderson constantly does.  Any chance of crossing the Alps to visit him?  No place so peaceful as Rye.  He does well to carry a gun. <num>#6251</num></p>

              <p>Responding to two of his letters.  Returned just yesterday having been drawn into complications of travel and time-expenditure than he at all desired, though they were enjoyable enough.  The Hereford marriage was one, and was tempted to visit the wonderful Welles, where there was an exquisite cathedral where he dined with the bishop in his marbled palace.  As for his lucid and excellent long letter, he sent it to his father.  Doesn't see why he should be shut up at Giverny with him: of all the artists in the world!  Nothing could be more satisfactory and interesting than the account you made of your actual conditions and feelings, fidelity apart.  James concerned about him joining four compatriots.  Make sure that he does so only if he is strongly moved to join them.  Holding back on letters of introduction because he doesn't want to disturb him. <num>#6251-av </num></p>

Hopes they sit there very light this summer.  Mentions J. B. Warner and his wife, who is ill and being sent to a sanatarium.   It has been horridly cold and backward till yesterday which ushered a blessed little burst of summer.  Asks if he is with the little band of the Rue Bonaparte?  Paris must be splendid and summery.  P.S.  Considers, since the weather is so beautiful, to rush over to Paris to see him, but he is too pressed with bleated work.  P.P.S.  Just found a letter which settles all his concerns about Bill's father.  Although it concerns him that they have that wretched small child of the Salter's adoption.  Where are the Salter's and why this incubus?  What golden words the dear Dad is liable to drop. <num>#6251-ar</num></p>

Probably has reasons for thinking it best not to stay, but wants to discuss, very discreetly, why he plans on returning to Boston.  Discusses beauty of Lamb House Gardens despite three rainless months.   Take good care of his mother's letters and bring them back: they represent a pretty good recent series of weeks for his mother and father.  Make sure his mother has little to "do" over the next year.  Hopes Peg sticks to Bryn Mawr.  Wants to hear all about Holland. <num>#6251-ar </num></p>

The work has merit, but it's too long and the subject is pumped too dry.  He shall never again do anything so long-winded.  Finds that he can't read new fiction himself, and is lost in wonder at the strange law that condemns him to write it, and to assume a reading of the same by others, unlike himself.  They will talk of the wondrous idea of her going to America.  She must let him indoctrinate her up to the eyes.  Is he a convert, she asks?  A fanatic, he replies.  Found the perpetual gregarious and loquacious feeding of the United States very detrimental to it, and though he clung to the theory there, the practice went to pieces, but he has come back to it since his return. <num>#6251-a </num></p>

She will adjust herself, and on the whole like it, though doubts if she stays the full time.

              <p>Waited to acknowledge his touching, harrowing letter about his indigestion and dyspepsia: trying to get them together.  Root of his disorders lies in the lonely insanity of his manner of work.  Tension of fantastic number of figures on which he is realizing nothing, neither money nor judgment.  Attempting what no young artist ever did, putting his eggs into an extremely precarious and perforated basket.  Stop his multiplication of unsaleable nakedness for a while, and hurl himself into the production of the interesting, charming, vendible, the placeable small thing.  With his talent, he can easily.  If he were near, he would take him by the throat, and make him do his best.  Must get to busts.  It is only by the face that sculpture can hope to live, and it is so supremely and exquisitely interesting to do.  Have patience with his words.  Wants to see Mrs. Gardner who has seen Anderson lately, and will give him his news.  Long discussion of health system "Fletcherization," which James has adopted and which worked off all his ailments.  It has renewed his elderly life, and might help Anderson. <num>#6251</num></p>

Another omission: <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">In the Cage,</title> a London corner with a grocer's shop containing a postal telegraph office.

He shall read it with interest, knowing they agree on many points, and will find out what he thinks about the others!  Hopes to see him in June.  Has request to make of him.  His boys tutor, Collison Morley, more a scholar than a writer, has done accompanying notice about [Giosue] Carducci, and wants it printed over his name.  Seems to him to contain the right sort of information about the great man, very little known in England.  Could James send it to one of the editors he must know?  Morley doesn't care much whether article is paid for, provided it appear in his name.  He is anxious to get some sort of literary work which he could do there, such as reviewing.  Thinks it would help if this were printed in a periodical.  If it is too much trouble, he should send it back. <num>#6111-r</num></p>

He will have observed how difficult it is to get anything serious or interesting or decent periodically published in England or the United States, where nothing is cared for, but the most blatant vulgarity or triviality.  But he will press the cause of manuscript in question. See Francis Marion Crawford to Henry James, 1907 March 9, regarding Morley manuscript. <num>#6251-w</num></p>

              <p>So overwhelmed by work, just settled down with his American Scene, which in its peculiar way seems to him supremely great (describes their different writing styles in detail).  James's is rummest method to employ systematically as he does nowadays, and he employs it at his peril.  Directs him to say it out, for God's sake, and have done with it.  Give us one thing in his older directer manner to show he can still write according to cannons for gleams and innuendos and felicitous verbal insinuations, he in unapproachable, but core of literature is solid.

Loves to know book touched in her a chord of interest.  It was a difficult job to do, and a projected sequel proved so difficult he has given it up altogether.  Coming abroad for so many weeks in Paris, Rome, etc. doesn't make for the retention of American impressions.  However, he is facing homeward impatiently.  He is never in his life coming abroad again.  She alludes to matters of which he wants to hear everything, and he shall knock at her door if she is enjoying the terrible London of June. <num>#6251-a</num></p>

              <p>He has failed in the most comprehensive matter to keep in touch with for months.  Doesn't do anything he needs to.  Make plans, etc. as he did before years of infirmities had imposed on him the economics of existence which led him to make so poor a figure to her.  Fevered London clashes were made up of appointments, etc.  Has become too much and too many for him so he couldn't see her at all because of her social character.  She is Society.  Ancient quiet of his place is thing of the past: too many visitors.  She must come down some autumn Sunday. <num>#6251-o</num></p>

              <p>All thanks and blessings.  I return everything, with one rather painful (saddening) one from your Uncle Bob: his daughters' engagement by such perversity and insanity!  Don't return to me, and don't keep this last.  I send a letter of Peggy's; it is very interesting and delightful.  James only a little disconcerted at his spoken to his family about returning home.  Don't, oh Billy, don't!  You give James such a turn.  It knocks the fond dream he has of going over to see him, which won't be conveniently possible for him till February.  Don't make any such projects.  It's a great deal better to leave them to themselves for the winter.  That is what they are adjusted to.  But forgive their outbreak.  J. S. Perry's visit was very pleasant, and gathers for him.   Extraordinary mildness, if not hotness, right now.  Don't desert your fond old Uncle. <num>#6251-av </num></p>

              <p>Horrible that his charming letter waited so long for an answer, but James has had a bad time; so much work holds him.  Extreme pleasure to hear from him.  News sounds good as he doesn't say he was unwell.  Grand that things are okay.  Holds his breath over the abundance of his inspiration; they will have to build a city to take his work in.  James interested in the casting of his bust though scared he thinks him worthy.  It will never do for it to be a gift, though his pocket has been empty of ready money.  No chance to get bust exhibited in London as only British sculptors have that opportunity, but can exhibit privately.  Cast it, photograph it, and send the picture to him, and he will work on getting it displayed. <num>#6251 </num></p>

              <p>All about a hopeless meeting.  Hopes to conjure away blight by seeking her out in Stratford.  In town only in snatches of time.  Wishes E. Norris might be counted on for a little more of that.  Deplored death of his remaining relations.  He is a quiet obscure hero of patience and stoicism.  He will never leave Torquay: there never was a less Londony man. <num>#6251-a </num></p>

              <p>Charmed by beautiful regularity with which as she shakes the magic boughs, the fruits of her genius fall into his undeserving lap.  Diana Mallory has just presented herself.  She almost makes him feel as if he were the headlong reader of romance for which he has given up struggling to know himself.  It's one hundred to one that she will presently work the miracle.  He is sorrier than he can say for all the months that go by without their meeting.  It would be in town as he goes nowhere else.  Would go if he could find her at Grosvenor Place.  Longs to see her. <num>#6251-a </num></p>

              <p>Wrong in thinking he did not see his exhibition.  On the contrary, made use of his ticket.  Admires his things: quality of his colorless work.  Also drawn to his experiments in color, but not drawn to them yet.  If he is going back to the United States don't cut his cables and stay, then they can talk.  Doubts he will be in town before he sails.  Probably will have another book to send before he goes; rest will wait his return.

              <p>Kind of her to care for news of the small comedy of things, and to have taken pleasure in Jessie Allen's rosy report of it.  It is a pot-boiler of 14-15 years ago, treacherously not done then by Ellen Terry for whom he wrote it.  Disinterment after long years.  It's his only little attempt to "write down" to the common intelligence of the awful London theatregoers.  Can't think of Maud Story without anguish; what a tortured life!  [John Singer] Sargent is doing magnificence for Boston; he has sold all of his watercolors to the Brooklyn Museum of Art.

              <p>Has an awful arrears of correspondence, which has snowed him in.  Thanks for information on the next Ballot, but finds himself at a disadvantage for any sort of participation, so that he is tempted to ask him to not count him in at all.  Confesses that he doesn't make out what we mean, or are, or intend or design or represent, what our organization is all about.  The most recent document sent him was as vague and colorless and neutral to an uninspiring degree.   Enough cut out for a "Rhadamanthine institution in this age and in these lands of the triumphant Cheap and Vulgar."   Nothing vague or ambiguous or non-committal interests appeals in the least.  We can do nothing without exasperation.  We need that wholesomely stern state of the spirit before we need Money, which seems so dreadfully easy to come by.  Regarding potential candidates, Owen Wister and Frank Millet.  Thanks further for information about the new American copyright arrangements, although they help, at the same time they are not graceful. <num>#6251-as </num></p>

              <p>Appreciates her sympathetic letter.  The article in the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Times Literary Supplement</title> on his American editions by Percy Lubbock is a beautiful and intelligent thing, and it gives the greatest pleasure.  It does that young man great honour, but it does him no less.  It is soon for him to give way to elation at sixty six!  But it does seem to suggest that's the more or less interpretive critic; let them hope that may be verified.  Expects a relationless year, so he hopes to see her.  Understruck at all her magnificent activity.  Accepted his own similitude to the lumbering tortoise, and is trying to practice the motions of that animal on the stage of the Haymarket and elsewhere.  <num>#6251-a</num></p>

              <p>He must have seemed absent and silent since their arrival in England: June and July days fill themselves more and more in the country, not less than in London, with complications, etc.  He simply fled from London.  Now back.  Glad they are to be in York, even at price of motoring which he hates when he sees, hears, or smells it.  Cars show the land and the world as nothing else does, and he is grateful they have come before he passed away.  Great thing is they will be in England for some weeks, and he will come up to meet them in town.  Discusses Dedham Church window and the murder of Sir. C. Wyllie who deserved such treachery as little as a man could.  Thanks for her allusions to Percy Tublock's article in the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Times Literary Supplement</title>, which he found charming, and the most appreciative and fine tribute he has ever received.

Forgive him for giving a note for them to an in interesting young friend, "literary" Hugh Walpole, son of Rector of Chelsea and Canon of Southwick, a descendant of the great Horace Walpole.  He will give them recent news of James. <num>#6251-ag</num></p>

              <p>He is still a halting convalescent from interminable dismal illness which has kept him hideously silent, with music of her beautiful voice in his ears.  Admirable news she gives makes him feel as if he were up to a letter.  Holds out his arms impatiently for a commemorative hug.  Grand for both of them, grander that her poor old hermit friend has luck of having key.  Wilfred Sheridan whose forbears he knew and admired years ago; they are a pair beautifully matched and gives them a fond benediction.  Would push for chair at their table if he was fit for social scene.  August 12 he goes to America for several months.  Her sketch of basis of their union very vivid.  James is emerging and riding to the surface again, though still liable to beastly bad days. Includes a note by Clare Frewen written on outside of envelope:  "Henry James on my engagement to Wilfred Sheridan." <num>#6251-a</num></p>

              <p>Thanks for her letter of comprehension of her delayed return in respect to his coming to her at Overstrand September 8th.  Thanks to his still being on the fringe of recovery from a miserably long illness.  Thinks what keeps him from feeling better is desperate desire to get back to dear old England again.

              <p>Touched by the kindness and fidelity of her letters.  They are the first echo of Chocorua since his return to England.  Arrived in awful heat and drought.   Most distressful general Railway Strike, in fact already bad in the Midlands and the North.  Went away from the hot glare of the South Coast and his suffering garden to the refuge of a very kind friend.  The railway strike raged on our line when going to London, with dismal delays and uncertainties.  Rather a blot on the surface of dear old England, usually so cool and moist and green, so convenient and comfortable.  But the case will improve, and one will improve one's self with it.  Rejoices in news of her sitting with Bill.  Welcomes more than he can say her impressions of dearest Peg's progress.  His sister-in-law will be happy to know that he is writing again to  Mrs. [ ?] who is finishing the portrait begun of him fifteen months ago.  Reminisces of time he and Alice James spent together.  The portrait is now practically finished.  Painted with remarkable ability, but almost void of real resemblance.  Wishes they were all with him yesterday when he motored to Audley End, belonging to Lord Braybrook, but formerly a royal residence. <num>#6251-bg </num></p>

              <p>Great joy at the better turn of his situation.  Delighted at his marrying.  He and Alice will be able to come to Lamb House and feel at home.  It really is a thoroughly pleasant and cheerful little abode.  Kidd and Burgess will hurl themselves upon you in an avalanche of devotion.  Will be so happy that you will forget for a while to find it dull.  Hopes with all his heart their nuptials will go off well and when they sail for Plymouth it will be on a big and comfortable and not crowded German Lloyd.  Yearns for every detail of the Chicago Seine.  Will get news from Bill's mother and Harry and Aleck.  Sad that Peg must be absent, but will be a part of his later life and labors.  Wanted to send him a wedding token but now that he is coming thinks it safer to wait.  Have had endless rains but for you and Alice they will stop. <num>#6251-ar</num></p>

The lovely child should find a younger, braver, nimbler presence; appreciates their exquisite confidence.  He must have been through terrific tension as Clare's crisis was due.

              <p>Struggling out from avalanche of information he let drop on him with his tale of working in the colossal and in the air.  James is staggering on his feet after the flu.  Breaks his heart for Anderson's mania for the colossal, which is burying him in a bottomless, thankless, fatal sandbank.  There is no application of these enormities.  Wants to warn him against Megalomania: love and pursuit of the big, the bigger, the biggest.  Thinks of him howling for hours on end until he chucked his paraphernalia bravely into the Tiber.  As if any use on all the mad earth can be found for a ready-made city.  Realize how unspeakably much these cold, desperate words, withholding sympathy, cost him. <num>#6251 </num></p>

              <p>How can he thank her for such a beautiful letter?  If being daughter of Puritans doesn't sow the end of such impulses, and being a sister of the Amenities, does long live again that admirable and awful race.  Thinks she put a splendid charity on his ill-starred Browning effort.  Demoralized by delay before he got to his feet, and lost confidence and courage.  Talks of her going to French coast, which she will have to explain as Mrs. [Mary] Ward explains Ulster.  Wouldn't mind her being so backward if she wasn't by way of being so forward.

              <p>Blessed by her note.  Deeply interested in her plans.  Rejoices that she will come up on the 6th.  If she comes up earlier in the day he could take her to two private views in the afternoon.  Will take her on to a much more interesting one on Friday that will be very pleasant.  She can wind up loose ends back at Lamb House.  But he will hold fast to her until the last moment.  He takes his honorary degree at Oxford on the 26th and will come back to town on the 27th at nearest.  Her days will easily fill themselves at Lamb House.  Will go with her to the Tower and to the House of Commons, everywhere, anywhere, but to dine at the Clarks and at the [Lee-Warners]!  Could almost weep at her being reduced to the Society of the Marshalls.  However, Kidd and Burgess and Jean will make up for them, I hope.  Interesting letter from Harry (from Chocorua).  There is a most distressing fact in it, that a very long letter that James wrote him never reached him.  The explanation is with the tragic Titanic, although James didn't check the date, it must have been posted a fortnight before the Titanic.  It's the only letter in all the years that he can remember losing, and it is rather miserable as it will be a difficult one to write over.  If she comes on Thursday, won't be able to see her until the next day as he is dining out that night.  But he will communicate early. <num>#6251-av</num></p>

              <p>His clouds are very artful and beautiful, and his publication most elegant and charming.  He has combined photography remarkably with aviation.  A couple of his pictures could have been taken only from an "aeroplane."  Understands his sense of exile at horribly cheerful, booming, luminous and barbaric Los Angeles; must be a long, drawn-out torture.  Remembers how it struck him ten years ago as a cluster of the more ragged fringes and a strangle of deafening and death-dealing car tracks.

              <p>Dictated.  Forgive this brutal machinery to which he is reduced if he can't delay in responding.  Just over a violent and detestable attack of the "Shingles."  Letters have piled up.  Pain extremely excruciating.  Asks Bill if his father suffered from this condition?  Or was it you?  Remembers his mother nursing one of them.  Very dismal because it came upon him when he just got over another illness.  Months have not been happy for him.  The poisonously cold and wet summer may must have been responsible for his condition.  His staff has been ministering angels.  Fanny Prothero has been often by his bedside, discussing Alice a lot.   Remembers, before his illness, a number of sweet September afternoon turns with Fanny P. all over the countryside: very refreshing and interesting, and always, on the part of those ladies, inquiries and ravings about you.  Will be moving to two delightful and sufficiently spacious rooms where he will be able to put up his three servants commodiously enough.  October 13:  Had to break off letter yesterday.  Feels that when he is over this sickness he will be fitter than at any time for ever and ever so long past.  Tell Aleck thanks for his beautiful letter.  Obtained in London the very good photograph of the Robert Allerton head and that two copies of the same went to Monticello, Illinois.  Discussed difficulty in sending previous photographs.  Writes about the recent tragedy of the wicked old Brede: little Ghita Stanhope, a friend of Clare Sheridan's, "blew her brains out, in the most gruesome way" some six weeks ago.  She was frankly demented.  She struck me as the most charming young thing conceivable.  October 15:  Again had to break off letter.  Relapsed again.  Lamb House is a good place to be ill, being so honest and true a little nook.  Yearns over Peg to the fullest extent.  Envies her sinking so deep into Mamma's so deeply sweet hospitality.  Send news of Harry's great visions and echoes in New York. <num>#6251-av</num></p>

              <p>Dictated.  Has been laid up 3 weeks with "shingles."  Still most sorry, but is working off some correspondence.  Can make no social adventure.  He feels chapter of "social adventure" forever closed and he must go on for the rest of his days at home.  He is aged, infirm, unsociable, and detached in the political game which forms the constant carnival for young people.  Has view of coming to town after Christmas, and reserves the social adventure of tea at Grosvenor Place as the highest crown of his confidence.  Glad she has finished a gallant piece of work.

              <p>Dictated.  Thanks her for expression of kindness.  Doing his utmost to get better.  Yearns when he thinks of the balm of talking with her.  Wrote to H. G. Wells who sent him "Marriage," but would rather have written her.  With him he felt irrelevant and vain and ineffectual.  Strange, in his affair, the coexistence of so much talent with so little art, so much life with so little living!  Thinks him more interesting by his faults than he will probably manage to be in any other way, and he is a vivid and violent object lesson.  Envies her the jollity of having polished off a brilliant coup and celebrating the case in Paris.  Enter into a relationship with Mrs. [Edith] Wharton, if convenient, if she is back from the last of her dazzling braveries of her far excursionism. She may be able to appease his always lively appetite for news of her.  Don't acknowledge this letter in any manner with all else she has to do.  Talks of young people vs. aged and infirm.  Asks her not to pity him his dim exclusion; the past words seem to him the very measure of intellectual insipidity, rather than representing the "salt-of-life" as she put it. <num>#6251-a</num></p>

              <p>Dictated.  In dismal arrears with Bill and Alice, but responds to their letter.  The days are better for him.  The move to town has been very helpful, and his situation couldn't be better.  Jane and Wilfrid and Emily Sargent are the fondest, faithfullest little neighbors.  Kidd came back in rapture at being restored.  Kidd is really a heroine, of judgment as well as devotion.  Please keep an eye on her in respect to the eventual future.  Most importantly, James takes great pleasure in their present turn of life.  Glad he was in Boston recently, as it helped James see and feel their condition.  February 5:  Had to break off letter yesterday.  Forgive him.  Still recovering from sickness which has been sticking to him like a poisonous plaster.  Dr. Wheeler continues to help, though he has seen rather remarkably few doctors.  Many specifics about James's sickness, but tells them not to worry.  Happy to hear that his blest Aleck will be sailing to see him June 10th.  Bill and Alice must be the most howling social successes that Boston has ever known.  Wishes he could be there to show how howling the old uncle finds them.  Discusses work on his sitting-room walls by Earnest von Glehn.  <num>#6251-av </num></p>

He has had to give himself up to having a sudden ailment looked after, which is being successfully done.  Glad she has been kind to Hugh Walpole, on whom nothing good or fine is wasted.  He is a valued, young friend and he cherishes him.  Egging her on to read <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Fortitude</title> is another matter.  It's doing well may not be an enlightening thing for him.  Hasn't been to Paris in five years.  Would rather go to Hoxton to hear Chevrillon on Galsworthy.  To hear it rubbed in would be the end of all things.  He took his paper in the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Revuee</title> for a strange and cruel practical joke, or a piece of macabre irony.

Doesn't miss his freedom of range if he can only stay as he is.  Just received the splendid printed sheets from him.  Pleads with him against a size of page that defies human handling: people won't read what they can't, such as the huge folios.  It is very handsome, but judges expensive.

              <p>Distress and embarrassment have kept him silent.  Forced to speak of certain matters.  Anderson had written of plans for <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">World Centre</title> and sent first installment of his pamphlet <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">World conscience. </title> He appears to have forgotten the impression James tried to give.  Does he think James likes to tell him he doesn't and can't go with him, congratulate him, or understand his projects and plans so vast and vague and meaningless to him?  He takes so much for granted.  Left so short a time ago Roman studio and statues, interesting and limited if a little alarming in scale and number.  Can only give James pain to be forced to give criticism on what he can't understand:  Anderson's term "world" and his vain and false presumptions seem to James nothing.  They would seem so if James were not old and ill and detached, and reduced to ending his life in restricted ways.  Loathes such pretensions of "world" anything.  Can't sympathize or support Anderson's proposals.  Must cultivate his garden morally and intellectually.  Anderson must recover the proportions of things; the way he is following <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Megalomania</title> is leading to madness.  They can talk if Anderson sees reality, things as they are. <num>#6251-a</num></p>

              <p>Thanks him for his splendid letter.  His letter a great joy because of the vivid images and accounts of the blest little sub-nephew, or indeed super-nephew, and the authentic report of his work.  Alice's photographs of the infant are intoxicating.  Envious of Peg, who has gone home to see the infant in the flesh, in which she may bury an affectionate nose, what flesh, what proportions, and above all what a beautiful and incomparable head.  Keep sending photographs.  Peg's departure has been a true and great loss to him.  Enjoys that she clearly likes dear old England.  Lamb House has never been sweeter, and now it has been a most perfect September he has ever seen.  Old Protheros and Fanny are still at Lamb House, though they depart shortly.  Wishes he could find a quiet pair of tenants for Lamb House during the seven months he will be in town.  If they know of anyone, please pass them along.  Discusses Aleck growing up, although wonderstruck at his being able to stand the Thayer madhouse.  James lies awake nights thinking of Aleck, and would pay more for a squint of something he has done than for a ticket for the Russian ballet.  Asks Bill to treat his picture not as an Experiment, but only and ever as a production and a performance that he needs to be absolutely committed to, and then work out the given wrongness as much as he likes.  But to no given wrongness should he ever sacrifice any saving rightness, that time!  Treat every time now as the right time, for finish!  But on that basis do anything and everything that will help him finish.  Sorry about the non-success of the Kitty Emmet portrait.  Alice will have a letter all to herself. <num>#6251-aw </num></p>

              <p>Will he conceive of his approaching him as the most abject of worms, most contrite of penitence?  If he could see him for an hour all would become plain, and he would wring his heart with his true and inward history.

              <p>Great pleasure to have heard from him.  When one is in James's state of immobility, time seems to operate at extraordinary speed.   F. Phillips's story loses nothing by the admirable hand in which it is written, "if you don't mind my saying so."  May you spread far and wide, among your brave Mormons, the example and ideal of that brave fist!  There is no detail of your stiff ordeal as a maker of the civilization that you require and devise that I can't imagine.  Understands how the ordeals must try his wife, who has plunged into them with such a state of horrible contrast.  It is one of the very rules of the game that setting in a huge new crude country can't be liked.  The liking comes afterwards when you reap the rewards of patience and courage.  Be very sure you will reap that reward.  He is an agent for civilization, a builder of a new life.  James doesn't want to preach, but just give him a pat on the back and assure him that he thoroughly believes in him and his opportunity.  Will send him a whiff of old England at the risk of quickening his homesickness.  Talked of Phillips to his very intelligent young friend Dunster who has lately written to him.  Understands the pains of homesickness.  James will be going to London in three weeks for the winter.  Has been a very wet season.  Communicates only with the dim Canadian ghost who haunts the spot for James.  He finds the point of space Magrath in the only altar he happens to possess, which is twenty years old, however, and where it wasn't to be discovered.  James takes it as a good portent that the Mormons flock about him.  Thanks him for having found his old novel, a very old one, a relief to the tedium of his journey.  Send his blessing to him and his wife.  Pull together and you'll pull through! <num>#6251-bb </num></p>

Seems to him she has worked out something in a different way from any she has yet used.  Discusses his criticisms of book at length.  Tells her to keep it up.  Hopes she takes breath and that peace and ease surround her.  Don't stay in country too long after he comes to town, which he plans for the 20th.  Talks of her children.

              <p>Touched by her remembrances, and he would have answered but all initiative is sapped at the root by an ailment.  Reduces his activities, but he is better than a year ago and hopes to be better still.  Also the case with Jessie Allen.  She is sounder than she was last year and there is much improvement in her voice.  Her illness has broken the baleful reign of the Vampires.  The dynasty is voted in exile, and the unspeakable Izzie is known no more in the land.  She is a neighbor as is Emily Sargent.  There has been achieved between Sargent and James one of the very finest of all portraits.  It is the rarest perfection, and he is bewildered at having become in this battered phase, the occasion of so immortal a work.  Mrs. [Mary] Hunter continues wonderful for riding 30 hours at once, etc.  She is a beautiful "organism."  P.S. Mrs. [Edith] Wharton's novel is a miracle of cleverness considering how its material has been guessed and chanced rather than really observed by her personally, touched, or experienced. <num>#6251-ag </num></p>

Lunched with Dunster who has just been transferred to a new job in the Custom House.  But his principal news was the death of his mother.  Dunster is indeed intelligent and promising, but seems younger in London than he did at Rye.  Interested in what he said of having to retrain for Canadian standards or requirements, so apparent that he is in a fresh and independent world, a more strenuous and on the whole more inspiring and rewarding one.  England  is comparatively stale and clogged and congested; one hopes that he sticks to it.  Hopes he gets  his chance at Calgary without too long waiting.  Appreciates his fidelity.

              <p>Glad to hear of his happier conditions and prospects.  Took liberty of passing it along to Dunster, who has been relegated to winter's work in Scotland.  Dunster mentioned that he hasn't heard from Phillips in a very long time.  James infers that he must be glad he migrated, but he must say that we see here now as through a glass darkly everything that is not of the huge haunting oppression and obsession of the War.  You can't imagine how that enormous fact presses upon us and overhangs us at every moment of consciousness, and how unreal and insignificant and irrelevant everything else appears.  If it is to be a "long" war, which probability we absolutely took for granted and frankly faced from the first, there is every appearance that we can hold  on and on to a degree never at all apprehended by Germany, who took for granted brevity with extraordinary arrogance to make and keep everything short and sharp.  This assumption on her part has been immensely falsified, as most of her assumptions have been.  But I can't dilate, beyond saying that the whole spirit and attitude and energy of the country are magnificent.  Send us all the blest Canadian volunteers you can; all are of immense importance.  Heard from a Canadian soldier that the French Canadians are instructed by their Church, which they so thoroughly obey, which makes up for their great natural blankness and ignorance about the reasons, connections, the very nature and geography, of the war.  Rye has done very well: sent off two hundred men.  Rye has her complement of the Belgian wounded and of the never to be sufficiently pitied, compensated and avenged Belgian refugees.  Has seen little of Dunster, but that his time in Scotland will be grim with the winter coming.  Cannot send Phillips illustrated papers because everything we do now is for the War, and the War only.  His efforts with the war are exhausting, physically and financially.  <num>#6251-bb</num></p>

              <p>Thanks for her most interesting communication about her gallant grandson.  She is probably as proud as she is bereft.  James thinks of him with an unspeakable pang, as he thinks of her, proportionately gallant for her part.  Of his mother James scarcely dares to think.  He almost ventures to wish to let her know with what a tenderness of imagination his mind turns to her. Note:  Doubtless the young man had been killed at the first battle of Ypres which was fought during the first half of November. <num>#6251-bh </num></p>

              <p>Thanks for his inquiry.  He has suffered, as everything in life is at the mercy of horrific public situation.  Nothing is as it ever was before.  All one's efforts go to living through the long nightmare of this black consciousness.  Ill-health and added years keep him exhausted since the war settled on them.  Touched he wrote in thick of his own agitation and adventures.  Relief to hear of his return to terrace over the Tiber.  Spent last summer at Lamb House, but came back to London early, as he can't bear solitude and confinement of the country.  Lent Lamb House to the War.  Interest in London gets full force of war, and passion of one's sympathy with cause for which the Allies are fighting gives a savor to life in exile.  Sympathy and pity and uncertainty have a depleting effect on the apology he has tried to express to him.  Trying to get back to work, and hopes Anderson has done so.  Hopes he doesn't break down on terrible question of what Italy is going to do.  Feeling of confidence is greater as England only now begins to feel armed and equipped and ready, same of France, and probably in some weeks for Russia.  Assurance of Allies can only be still in a long war.  This is very horrible, not horrible that he is fondly faithful to him. <num>#6251</num></p>

Thinks it safe for British adaptation.  It is only another sign of gulf that separates these two people.  Last theatrical event in London was the complete fiasco of Mrs. Langtry in version of Père Goriot [Balzac] which apart from complete rigidity of the actress is pronounced deadly dull and deadly dirty by the London press and public, while same play was so stimulating in Paris!  Last news there is the great dynamite affair, most dreadful, any attempts done under nose of London police, unable to put a hand on anyone.  Papers blame Americans for not catching the villain.  Much anxiety in General Stewart's army.  Is he still in touch with "the little thing" [Daudet]?  Always interested in him.  Written a few lines to Huntington. <num>#6251-c</num></p>

              <p>Thanks for his letters and endorsements of Goncourt.  Agrees, but there is still something disagreeable in Goncourt, something of vanity, but he writes exquisitely.  Why will Goncourt make them wait 20 years for more?  In his place, with his opportunities, he would poison Goncourt tomorrow.  Talks about Daudet, and adoring his words.  Divided feelings regarding Paris, but has worked into quiet waters, and finds life possible in London.  Ideal would be five months in London, five months in Italy, and one in Paris.  He has settled down in this Indian village: the dark back bedroom, the dim front sitting room.  It is hideously political.  He is lonely and speechless; everything is stuffy, literal, unspeakably Philistine.  Went to see [Salonici] and he is the greatest of the great.  Stick to his bright little Parisian, and the civilization of the Gauls.  Yours cynically. <num>#6251-c</num></p>

              <p>Thanks for photographs; portrait fine and interesting.  Brings back dear man in his most pleasing.  How strange that a good portrait revises and recreates what is buried and finished.  Shall hang it in some familiar corner.  Thinks of Paris, which has been near in person of Dr. Henry [Cazalis?], etc.  Wishes he would come and throw a light on Paris situation, though his comparisons of Paris and London in the fall plunged him into deep gloom.  The American picture books pay far better, but they are such a damnable unliterary medium.  Discusses dreariness of working with Alden, who has literary ideal of Buffalo, New York, and [Frank] Harris, who obtained dialogue with [Paul] Bourget on science and poetry, which is in French in the April <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Fortnightly</title>, a coup.

              <p>Glad to have his news regarding his tiring of Paris.  Read his paper on Villon, and thought it very pretty.  Also received theatre tickets at his behest.  In London, but on point of embarking for the Normandy coast to spend the rest of the summer laboriously and frugally, but detained at the last moment.  Will stay and go to Italy for three months in September.  Will see him in Paris if he is still there.  Once a Parisian always a Parisian.  Paris must be interesting now, between the elections and the trial of Mademoiselle Gras.  Was there ever such an incarnate friend as this lady?  Newspapers palpitating as filled with accounts of terrible railway war in the United States.  These are not the times for an optimist.  Must try to get some of Huntington's cheerful disposition.  Writes about what James is reading and give his recommendations. <num>#6251-c</num></p>

              <p>His letter was a stimulating though depressing whiff of Paris.  Grieved at his account of dear old Huntington.  Forward him the enclosed words of sympathy.  Child mentioned absence of artistic slang in their Philistine tongue and agrees there are certain things the Anglo-Saxon mind never tries to say. French have run too much to clichs of that sort.  His account of Goncourt's "court" is appalling.  Is Mademoiselle Daudet susceptible?  What does he say of Mademoiselle [Hugues?]?  The demoralization of their country hums to our appetite.  Escape before the doom of Gomorrah descends on it to this virtuous clime, where the Dean of Hereford was arrested yesterday for indecent behavior with a young man in Hyde Park. <num>#6251-c</num></p>

              <p>Sorry to miss seeing him and Huntington in Paris.  He forgets London has after all "du bon." He is glad to find himself back at a British fireside.  He had spent six weeks in France in the provinces before visiting Paris.  Looked up M. Rabussen on Riviera and found him "dirty sans his <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">moindre</title> talent."  What the devil is coming over Frenchman to have lost perception of anything in nature but the genital organs?  He will probably think these structures of the most fiendish hypocrisy.  Thanks for account of Daudet's new novel which sounds very curious and interesting.  Awaits it with interest.  Tell him an American, not without talent, adores him, and spent a day at Tarascon solely for the love of him and his <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Aventures prodigieuses de Tartarin de Tarascon</title>.

              <p>Regrets not seeing him, but understands his anxieties, problems, etc.  As fond of London as ever.  Tells of [John] Hay and King, whose touch of madness was unexpected; he was a fascinator.  [Henry] Adams seems to be unemployed. James has been reading Sir Walter [Scott]'s letters: what a dear was that sweet, great man.  Caledonia was justified if she had begotten none else.  If in England this summer will visit him.

              <p>Appreciates the sentiment of her note and rejoices that his long-winded work left her with enough patience to write him.  When one has finished such a book, he speaks of its dimensions; one feels that he has shuffled off a mortal evil, but should have liked to get back into the skin of the muse long enough to listen to the conversations at the A. Russells.  P.S.  Went to first hours of a Religion in Russell Square on the theory she would be one of those at hand.  Fears it augers ill for the future of the Faith, that though the consolations of Religion are supposed to be great, those there offered failed under the disappointment of her absence.

Never dreamed of her burdening herself with the effort to express herself regarding his play, about which he had no illusions, and understands the restrictions, not to say the deadly silence which is what all his friends have practiced.  Tells why he wrote play.  Did not tend itself to a comedy of manners.  Play contains some damagingly poor acting.  If she sees anything of his again she will see a different sort of thing.

He does not want to review it, but the James letters was like boring through solid granite.  Not a Perry fan, and thinks all of his portraits confirm a stolidity.

Hers is the only review that has seen the point of the "story of the story."  That she did doesn't surprise him.  Small minds will say that they are friends, but they are not concerned with small minds.  Still, there can be no question of her "disinterestedness."  He prizes her review the most, and since they are friends, he feels her reviews are even more objective and exacting.  Hopes to tell her face to face how deeply he appreciates her work.

              <p>Gave no one the right to say that he either in theory or practice regards their present social bonds as vicious simply because they are imperfect.  Time will come when a perfect society or fellowship will prevail among men.  But it would be absurd to say that coercion was out of place in the present even with his beliefs about the future.  This would be bad logic and worse legislation.  Gives analogies to their situation.  The future is to be secured only on the condition of a rigid fidelity to the law of its present.

              <p> Four attached letters, dated February 25, February 28, March 4, March 17 to Hattie E. Hathaway.
* February 25, ca. 1874:  Yesterday was pregnant with snow and tempest, but today is bright and peaceful enough to counterfeit heaven to one's sensuous regard.  Contrasts his "inward meteorological change" with the changes in the weather.  Continues with a metaphor of a ship in a river-bed when the tide is out.  And he, like the ship when the tide comes in, upon a wave of womanly influence into his heart and mind, leaves him no voice but worship.  Never was a letter more surcharged with the effluence of womanhood.  Accepts an invitation to meet a company of ladies and gentlemen this evening.  Gives his thanks to invitation.  Yesterday she was an ordinary person; today she is holy and stainless to his imagination.  Blesses her for being what God has made of her, your faithful friend forever henceforth.
* February 28, ca. 1874:  Sends reply to her letter.  Feels devout joy and responds to the new force of womanhood.  It is not the literal woman, but the invisible woman, the aromatic, unconscious person who appeals to the spiritual senses primarily.  She sends exquisite grace, and was kissing in imagination the sweet white feet of her innocence, and looking up with devotion to the blue over-arching heaven of her womanly eyes and face.  Gives her advice about the people who feel prejudice about her.  Discusses at length his philosophy of Society.  It is their divine destiny to know this philosophy.
* March 4, ca. 1874:  Profusely thanks her for her most recent letter.  Discusses the "New Marriage Sentiment" in her bosom, which is so fast coming to renew the earth, and take up the despised and degraded and crucified form of sexual love into its renovating arms.  He feels her profound marriage-life throbbing in her letters, and yearns to give it consciousness.  Tells her of the ritual, which is nothing apart from itself, which he is sure she would be eager to acknowledge.  He could prompt its development in her, which he does with all his heart, and she will be born into the truth.  Of course being born again or renewed is somewhat painful to fleshly prejudice, but if he holds her in his arms every moment and ministers to her with infinite love, won't it be at least tolerable to her?  Write back quickly!
* March 17, ca. 1874:  Replying to her letter.  Sorry he was obscure, but took for granted a gentle familiarity on her part with his ideas about marriage.  Will tell fully what he means about the "New Marriage Sentiment" in regards to his marriage.  His wife is the greatest blessing of his life, and he is indebted to her.  But he and his wife have been tempted against the contractual bond of marriage, and it is a great pity that a greater freedom of divorce not be allowed.  Discusses his views on divorce.  As for Marriage, in the carnal type of marriage the man represents the universal element in existence, the material element, the gross realistic element; the woman represents the individual element, the spiritual element, and the subtle personal element.  Discusses the nature of "free-lovers."  Then discusses "thoughtful persons" role in marriage, that they are above the societal restrictions upon marriage, and can combine in a unity that is a friendship as much above love or conjugality as heaven is above earth.  Two people can make together the perfect image of the grand society which is coming, which is the universal marriage of all men with all women, and this is the holy verse of spirit.  This is his profound conviction.  Your postscript says "don't disappoint me," and that urgency is so extremely sweet that he can barely write. <num>#6251-bc</num></p>

              <p> Four attached letters, dated October 18, November 1, May 9, March 28, to Hattie E. Hathaway.
* October 18 [1874?]:  Your letter is so fragrant with inspiration that he could not help answering it on the spot, since it is so full of the "new wine" of the kingdom.  Curious how one manages to realize these sacred experiences amidst the din of trivialities.  Here she is, a person unknown to him by sense, and probably always to be so, though that is not a grateful suggestion to his imagination.  It is an ineffable horror to him if the worship he addressed to Him profaned the lower uses, or appropriated by an undevout heart.  But she shouldn't worry.  Her letters have a certain womanly charm: a charm of perfect grace and freedom.  She has associated him with the intimate wants of her life.  When she said in her last letter that "though you have yearned for the experimental knowledge of the love flight" that for a long time had scarcely a conscious longing which his blissful secret did not take to its heart.  Keep the enclosed letter in your private keeping and keep all his letters shut out from all knowledge but her own, for they are full of a love inspired by Himself and owing nothing in common with the base of the world.
* November 1:  Fell to influenza that prevented him from writing, but will two points from her last letter.  1.  Don't try to think of God incessantly.  The divine humanity has always been revealed to man in what is called the church.  The church is a purely symbolic institution.  Discusses the churches early use of symbols through animals.  But the symbols lost their significance, and the church became valued for its own sake.  A new revelation of God's perfection consequently took place in Jesus Christ, whose death and resurrection was in essence spiritual.   But there is a new change in the church, destitute of all ritual features.  Human society is Gods new truth, the society fellowship or equality of all men with each, and of each with all.  Thus, don't think of God, for He is all about her, in her bosom above all.  2.  She mentions that he would be disappointed if they met.  But when the meet he has nothing to do with her in the outward world, but only recognizes her inwardly.  But since she is the woman and he is the man he would render her infinite worship.  Very anxious to hear from her.
* November 9:  Still sick, but answers her sweet invitation.  Will meet her tomorrow at 3 P.M. and be sure to receive him as he will be very disappointed.  Will need to be off by 1.  
* November 28:  What a pleasant sight is her clear, shapely, feminine handwriting.  Hoped she would come back once the clouds and darkness bred of illness had lifted.  Rejoices in her exquisite and intimate friendship.  Wonders if she reads the papers, since he is involved with a  controversy with the Editors of the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Index</title>, which would be of interest to them.  Will send her all his letters but meanwhile tell him whether or not he should do so.  Her letters are full of so much womanly grace and sweetness, and so subtle an aroma of womanly charm that he covets them.  How sweet it would be to kiss her womanly feet, or find an altar of Divine worship in those gentle feminine hands which have ministered to him so many priestly benedictions. <num>#6251-bc</num></p>

              <p>Attached to ALS, December 24 [1875?], Henry James, Sr. to Hattie E. Hathaway, 4 pp. on 1 l.
* December 24:  Tired of waiting for her last response to his last letter of months and months ago.  Are you tired of the correspondence?  What is the reason you don't write? Reluctant to believe that she is definitively retired from their correspondence.  It may be that you are dead and gone to dwell among less noisy people than the Brooklynites, but have recently discovered quite unexpectedly your address, and am going to ascertain if you are not, as I hope, in the land of the living still.
* January 1, 1876:  Happy New Year.  She expresses a great <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">ennui</title>, but the expression is too vague to allow him the expectation of meeting it.  But she is suffering from spiritual celibacy, or a sense of almost utter disjunction between their private selfhood and that of the race.  The public self and the private self are perfectly one in God, but are declared enemies.  His communion with his wife and child being days and hours of uninterrupted peace and harmony.  Any chance acquaintance he makes with strangers in horse cars or elsewhere is filled with a Divine aroma that fills him with adoration.  Anything that helps his celebrate the Divine unity is his constant want and aspiration.  She too is of a true human quality, and would gladly be lifted out of her petty, personal dimension.  That is what makes him love her, his sweet H.E.H., and count upon her lasting love, upon a tie of friendship which ennobles all their intercourse. <num>#6251-bc</num></p>

              <p>What he prizes in her is her fragrant womanhood, or that ineffable aroma of divinity which men are covetous to expect in their own nature.  Men feel the horrible burden of selfhood, feel how it has corrupted them and laid waste to their life, and want nothing more than to be washed of them.  Woman is the symbol and the pledge of this Divine natural renovation.  To give up his belief in woman would be to give up his belief in God.  He is always inwardly thirsty for this spiritual refreshment.  Has no means of knowing whether she is handsome or plain, learned or simple, gentle or spirited.  He knows multitudes of women in both kinds, and scarcely find "Woman" among them.  It is not what one sees in any woman, but what one feels.  Women have a wholly Divine or unconscious influence exerted upon men, which makes men believe in a world of human possibilities yet to come, of which innocence and peace will be the stuff.  He longs to be reformed, and wishes to exchange the scent of his coarse earth for the fragrance of her regenerate heaven.  Women as a general thing are so untaught in the Divine Life.  One shrinks with horror for being mistaken, and having his highest religious emotions turned into mere ecstasy of sense.  Love craves always a finite fulfillment or satisfaction, a sensible consummation.  It is marriage and not Love which annuls all want.  I have had a glimpse of this heavenly rest in dreams (or rather visions).  We can realize God's life in our nature.  Her letters make him want to feel how sweet it would be to kiss her heavenly feet, and bow to her virgin motherhood.  Finds her a temple radiant with a Divine human substance.  She has read all his sacred things, and hopes she does not profane it, but return the letter if she does not like it or guard it from all other eyes if she keeps it. <num>#6251-bc</num></p>

              <p>Two letters attached with a title page, "Senile Sentimentality: Two letters from Henry James, Sen. to a lady he had seen but once or twice."  * [ca. 1878]:  It would be nothing short of Divine to see her in her house.  But no such Divine moments are allowed in the uncivilized life of theirs.  But thanks her for the imaginary possibility.  It has filled his bosom with a flush of heavenly glory, to hear of such sacred possibilities from her womanly lips.  If not for the tyranny of space and time he would be with her.  If she wrote a fortnight ago, he would have found time.  Perhaps in three weeks.  Begs her to tell him of her illness.  She afflicts him with her mysteries.  He is sick for her house.  How long must he think of it as adorned with that free, womanly, radiance?  His heart aches to know her heart.
* [ca. 1878]:  She gives him a glimpse of heavenly rest.  But she breaks his heart when she told him not to write him anymore.  His heart is fresh-quickened with life.  Her letters exerts the imagination in notable measure.  An indescribable aroma of womanhood breathes from all her letters, and fills one with worship.  How can he cease to write?  Doesn't want to offend her womanly instincts.  Who can one go to to find his inward or spontaneous instincts authenticated but woman?  It is so divinely sweet to feel the intense charm or her letters and be purged of all defiling thoughts?  Prays her not to ravish the cup from his lips unnecessarily, but let him drink his fill.  It is a cup where he shall never discover any dregs, and he knows this.  Rain upon him, and she will always find a grateful soil.  Isn't it a delight that she is a woman, and feel her power to lift men? <num>#6251-bc</num></p>

              <p> Four attached letters, dated March 29, April 19, May 2, May 18, to Hattie E. Hathaway.
* March 29 [ca.1879]:  Her letter gives her inspiration.  After he sent his letter, he reflected, and felt that he would rather die than expose her to possible danger and pain.  The way she expressed the risks and susceptibilities was so exquisitely frank and sweet that his heart was ravished anew.  He laid awake half the night with unaffected loathing once he thought about what she said.  He wants to repair the cruel wrong.  He has been thoughtless of her dear needs.  He never dreams of any intimacy with her but the intimacy of the worship of the altar.  The sentiment which burns in his soul towards her sex is so essentially chaste.  He will make himself more worthy of her.
* April 19 [ca. 1879]:  James won't let her take back what she said, of knowing beforehand the ground of his devotion.  She must have known it before he laid his heart bare to her as he did in its inmost privacies.  She must tell him that she will take the unworthy imputation of her womanhood back, or he shall feel wounded.  He would gladly go down to New York if he did not have to give lectures in Boston.  But the week after next he will be able to see her.  Asks if that suits her, for he will go any time that suits her.  Discusses at length the differences between men and women.  Animals, with their appetite and passion, have no rational control.  Men, however, the intellect is not controlled by the heart.  But woman, as she knows from the myth of Genesis, is formed not from the earth but from man's interior needs.  Of the two a new manhood will be generated which will blot out all discords.  Does she wonder, then, at the devoutness of his worship of woman, and how he longs to kiss her sweet representative feet, and press them to his bosom?  Tell him that she believes this.
* May 2 [ca. 1879?]:  He is knocked down by a severe bronchitis which prevents him going to New York.  He hopes to recover his freedom speedily, and use his freedom as she can easily divine.  Her indiscretion doesn't amount to anything observable except when she uses the phrase, "it won't pay, I fear."  She should dismiss all her timidities or fears in her relations with him.  He will be able to release her from that bondage, in so far at least as it is a very annoying one.  Meanwhile he rejoices in her sweet memory.
* May 18 [ca. 1879?]:  Alice James to Miss Hathaway:  Her father has had an attack of illness since Miss Hathaway last saw him.  He is confined, but the doctor hopes to get him out of doors.  He asked me this morning for the first time if there were any letters to him.  Showed him your envelope which he recognized the hand.  He told me to write to you saying that as soon as he could read her letter he would.  If she writes again, try not to cause much anxiety. <num>#6251-bc</num></p>

              <p>Attached to a group of letters written to Albert Leffingwell from William H. Bogart, E. W. Archibald, and Titus M. [Coan]. 
* Henry James to Albert Leffingwell:  Pains him to hear him say that he is very unhappy.  He should have had more pain in hearing him say, "without adequate cause or reason, I am very happy."  Because to be happy would imply a good degree of indifference to the universal lot.  He is infinitely more interesting to his imagination for being unhappy, because he is not self-centered but feels his unity with all mankind.  There may be some special physical or moral cause for his present <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">ennui</title>.  <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Ennui</title> is the disease of the Age.  Maybe, unknown to him, his heart is more active than usual in making its want felt, its sovereign want.  If there is anybody present to his senses who could reveal the want to him, then his trouble would be definite.  For woman's natural rectitude is so great that it is seldom she gives anything with her eyes wide open.  But he may have the happiness of a truly religious mind, which he takes him to be.  The lower parts of man must be satisfied for the higher parts to be happy.  Harlots are sure to go to the kingdom of God before such deluded persons.  Discusses in detail his religious beliefs and how they relate to society.  He is feeling this spiritual hunger and thirst.  Women don't feel as acutely as men their moral rottenness, because women are not apt to acknowledge an outward and abstract law, but only an inward and concrete life, but they feel their spiritual need even more acutely than men, for they feel it not reflectively as most men do simply, but in their actual flesh and bones.  What you want above all things is to meet this vague need and give it palpable form.
* William H. Bogart to Albert Leffingwell:  Has learned the lesson of respecting opinions from which he differs.  How can they change the great law of supply and demand?  Discusses in detail his philosophy of economics and society.
* William H. Bogart to Albert Leffingwell:  Thanks for article published in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Popular Science</title>.  His writing is not ephemeral, but long-lasting.
* E. W. Archibald to Albert Leffingwell, 1879 October 9:  Meet me at this office when it is convenient in reference to a letter he received from England.
* T. M. Coan to Albert Leffingwell, 1883 October 30:  Should have answered his kind letter and invitation earlier, but is waiting to pick a day or two out in November for Dansville.
* T. M. Coan to Albert Leffingwell, 1883 November 23:  He is safely home, back from Albion and Dansville.  His paper will be slow in appearing, but hopes to put something into it that will be of substantial service.
* T. Munson Coan to Albert Leffingwell, 1884 June 28: <num>#6251-bc</num></p>

              <p>Writing to them both.  Alice and she should discuss Trollope, whom Henry James hoped to see the English Balzac emerge.  As for Bill, Kenton tells him that she is the only reader so far as she knows or can deduce or infer who ever began her type of research with the simple open question, the question Henry James asked always before any artist's collected work: "What is his intention? What is he writing about?"  And the answer was just as simple and open, "that everywhere, buried in uncle H., is human drama."  It is just that simple.  Discusses recent discovery of a letter from Henry James to Thomas Sergeant Perry regarding Henry and William James's desire to go to college. <num>#6251-m</num></p>

Tells little anecdote about the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New York Sun's</title> reporting of the earthquake.  Asks about James's essays on Sargent and Daumier.  Saturday January 3, 1953:  his note was forgotten under heavy pressure of grave family illness and later death.  Received letter from Italy written for Percy Lubbock which claims James had no hand in the choice of the frontispieces. <num>#6251-m</num></p>

              <p> * Fanny Mecker letter:  James embodies the belief that is satisfying to the heart and intellect.  The truth of the Divine Natural Humanity or the Lord is manifest in the flesh.  My life is served daily from this eternal Spring.
* Anonymous letter:  Discusses Henry James under the pledge of secrecy.  James is a great man.  Seems to delight in the mysteries of women.  His philosophy is an easy one: a virtuous woman is a myth and the prostitution of women in not owing to mind but wants of the stomach and something lower, and can be taught to gratify their desires with the same impunity that men do.  Never intended to marry but was forced to.  Last winter he had a woman where he could put his hand on and off her for a long while, then introduced her to the mysteries, he says, "to her infinite delight."  Discusses details of his various women.  Writer has letters, which proves all he says.
* C. Robinson, September 1869: Has obtained the correspondence he mentioned.  Meet him at any point on the R.R.  
* J. C. Hathaway, September 18, 1869:  Have the document which was copied.  If any inquiries are made, keep dark.  If he has to write to anyone employ an amanuensis.  P.S. Please get some one to copy letter of C. Robinson.  Don't copy it yourself.
Attached to a group of handwritten documents entitled, "Social Studies 1869," regarding Henry James Sr., including notes by J. C.  Hathwawy, C. Robinson, and an anonymous letter discussing the James' philosophy of the nature of women.  <num>#6251-bc</num></p>
