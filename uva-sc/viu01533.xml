      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of two letters: M. B. Poitiaux,
         Wheeling, Virginia, to James C. Clarke, Greensburg,
         Pennsylvania, October 1856, concerning a upcoming meeting of
         the Board of Directors of the Hempfield Rail Road, and, R. L.
         Brown, Washington, D. C., to "Dear Judge," February 4, 1861,
         concerning the 1861 Peace Congress, the border states, General
         Winfield Scott, business prospects, and his family.</p>
      <p>Poitiaux's letter mentions James Kennedy Moorhead
         (1806-1884), a politician and businessman associated with
         railroad, telegraph, and canal enterprises for most of his
         career, and a member of Congress representing Pennsylvania
         from 1859 to 1869. [For another of Poitiaux's letters, see
         accession number 9110-C.]</p>
      <p>Brown, a pro-Southern advocate, predicts the creation of a
         Southern Confederacy but maintains that Virginia and four
         other border slave states will be held in the Union and forced
         to abolish slavery. He denounces General Scott as a dictator,
         says Washington is under martial rule, and anticipates the
         failure of the Washington Peace Conference (February 4-27,
         1861). Brown also discusses his willingness to engage in any
         type of profitable business with the judge, mentions the
         pending graduation of his son from medical school and asks the
         judge's assistance in helping him to establish a practice.</p>

          <p><lb/><lb/>Washington City Feby 4th 1861 
               <lb/><lb/>Dear Judge 
               <lb/><lb/>Your last kind favor has just been received--by
               some strange [fortuity] the letter was sent to the dead
               letter office and I accidently saw it among the list of
               dead letters advertised! This accounts for my not having
               answered it sooner. Since I last saw you, the political
               revolution has advanced a pace. This poor city is now a
               fortified camp--United States Soldiers are arriving by
               every Northern train and the prospect now is that by the
               4th of March we will be taken care of 
               <emph render="underline">in a horn</emph>. 
               <emph render="super">1</emph>At every turn you are
               saluted by trains of flying artillery, and Genl Scott 
               <emph render="super">2</emph>has now no less that three
               heavy trains of that arm of the service, to say nothing
               of the Mounted Dragoons and Infantry--in all some 1000
               regular troops. Six thousand of the Militia are being
               daily drilled by U. S. Officers and supplied with U.
               States Rifles 
               <emph render="super">3</emph>and other improved
               firearms. We are fast drifting to a military despotism,
               and this City--the neutral soil of the Republic, is to
               be the scene of the initiation of such a damnable
               dynasty. The Peace Congress meets here today--Their
               action will result in evil and that only, in inducing
               the border slave states to temporize and delay until
               Lincoln obtains the reins of government and binds them
               hand and foot so completely, as to shut out all hope of
               their extrication, except it be through oceans of blood.
               Rather than take such an alternative I believe Virginia,
               Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri and Delaware will
               ignominiously succumb, and agree to sacrifice the
               institution of Slavery. The Cotton States with North
               Carolina and Tennessee will form a Southern Confederacy
               and maintain it at all hazards and to the last
               extremity, and I trust in God that success may crown
               their efforts. They are the last hope for a
               constitutional Republic on this Continent--the Northern
               States have no proper idea of such a government, and can
               only appreciate the government of brute numbers and
               force. Genl. Scott is now virtually President and
               Commander in Chief, and is carrying things with a high
               hand. It requires no Prophet to foresee the end. I
               despair of my Country.</p>
          <p>Now a word about myself. My Wife's health is very
               delicate, and but for that I should have removed my
               family to Upshur 
               <emph render="super">4</emph>before this--I am afraid to
               turn my family out in such bad weather; but as soon as
               the Spring opens cleverly[?] I will give them the
               western shute. In your letter you say you have great
               prospects of realizing handsomely from the Coal oil
               business and add, "Why can't you join us and make a
               fortune"--In answer I will say that I am up for any
               thing by which I can make an honest living; and if your
               can suggest to me any situation likely to secure that
               result, just count me in. This is no idle offer on my
               part and I want you to consider it seriously. Again--My
               oldest son Dandridge will graduate at the Medical
               College here on the 1st of March, and I am gratified to
               be able to state that the Professors speak highly of his
               proficiency. 
               <emph render="super">5</emph>You traverse a large
               Circuit; and perhaps know of some location where he
               could commence with the prospect of making his bread for
               the first year or so. If you know of any such location,
               please inform me as soon as you can. I want to get out
               to see you all before long, but you are so much away
               from home on your Circuit that I hardly expect to catch
               you in Clarksburg. 
               <emph render="super">6</emph>Please therefore write me.
               Can't you come and take a peep at things here--if you
               want to get an idea of a military despotism you ought to
               look in upon us here.</p>
          <p>I expect nothing from Virginia but truculent
               submission and any other action on her part, will but
               agreeably disappoint me.</p>
          <p>Let me hear from you at your earliest convenience. If
               you know of any business I can engage in that will
               likely pay, call on me, and you will find me "yours to
               serve." My family desire to be kindly remembered to you.
