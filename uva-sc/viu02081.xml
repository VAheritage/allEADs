      <p>The fifth series consists of photographs of John Moffitt,

      <p>The last series contains miscellaneous papers and printed
         materials, including appointment calendars, autograph book,
         biographical data, including a paper "John Moffitt: A Poetry
         of the Changed Life" by Frank Lonergan, a chart of his
         published poems, a diary of Edith Kelker Moffitt, genealogy,
         musical scores, obituaries and eulogies, printed material,
         artwork, rubbings, and two Civil War items.</p>
      <p>The Civil War items consist of a brief diary belonging to
         Private Edward Lawrence Witman of Company F, 25th Pennsylvania
         Volunteers ("Lockhill Grays"), and his notes concerning the
         recruitment of the unit. Company F was recruited at
         Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on April 18, 1861, and mustered on
         May 2, 1861, for three months. Officers included Captain Henry
         McCormick, 1st Lt. William W. Jennings, 2nd Lt. George Fisher,
         and 1st Sargeant James Kemble. The company was mustered out on
         August 1, 1861.</p>
      <p>The notes about recruitment describe the recruitment
         process, drills, social events, and day-to-day events from May
         2-16, 1861.</p>
      <p>The men were shipped out of Harrisburg to Baltimore on the
         sixteenth of May, and left Baltimore for Washington City soon
         after their arrival.</p>
      <p>According to E.L. Witman's diary the "Lockhill Grays" were
         the first company to carry the United States flag through
         Baltimore following an attack upon Massachusetts troops. The
         diary describes the same time period as Witman's notes, but
         also includes Company F 's routine during their actual stay in
         Washington City from May 16-June 13. On June 10 they were
         ordered to the Arsenal to ship guns to Arlington. The diary
         does not describe any participation in actual battles.</p>
