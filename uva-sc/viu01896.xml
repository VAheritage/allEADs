      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Herbert E. Harris II was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on
         April 14, 1926. He did his undergraduate work at Missouri
         Valley College, Rockhurst College, and the University of Notre
         Dame, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degrees. Harris
         earned a law degree from Georgetown University Law School but
         his education was interrupted in 1942 when he served as an U.
         S. naval officer during World War II. He settled in Fairfax
         County in 1956 and became involved in civic affairs; in 1967
         he made his first campaign for public office and was elected
         to the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors.</p>
      <p>He was involved in concerns beyond northern Virginia; as an
         attorney specializing in international trade he helped draft
         America's first Food for Peace law in 1955. Seven years later,
         he drafted parts of President John F. Kennedy's Trade
         Expansion Act of 1962. In 1974 Harris was elected to Congress
         from Virginia's Eighth District as the state's first Catholic
         congressman. Harris served on the House Post Office and Civil
         Service committees and the House's District of Columbia
         committee. He chaired the House Subcommittees on the
         Bicentennial, Environment, and International Community during
         his first term. Harris was also an active member of the
         Environmental Study Conference and a founders of the Caucus of
         New Democratic House Members.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The 
         <persname>Herbert E. Harris</persname>(1926-) papers, ca.
         1974-1981, consist of ca. 43,000 items (107 Hollinger boxes,
         ca. 37 cubic feet), correspondence, newsletters, photographs
         notes, printed matter and miscellaneous materials resulting
         from Harris's tenure as a member of the U. S. House of
         Representatives during the 94th, 95th, and 96th Congresses,
         1975-1981, representing the Eighth District of 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>. These papers relate to his
         years in office until his defeat in his bid for reelection in
         November 1980. There is very little material specifically
         related to his campaigns for public office, and other
         miscellaneous activities.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the collection consists of correspondence
         between Harris and his constituents, including exchanges of
         political ideas and appeals for information or assistance.
         These provide some insight into the legislative activities of
         Harris as a congressman. One such example was his successful
         attempt to expand the boundaries of the 
         <corpname>Manassas National Battlefield Park</corpname>and his
         efforts toward the creation of a Tenants' Tax Justice
         bill.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement>
      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>The collection comprises six series. Series I, Public
         Relations; Series II, Correspondence; Series III, Legislation
         Files (correspondence and all other material relating to
         legislative measures were removed from other areas of the
         collection and consolidated as subseries within Series III);
         Series IV, Photographs; Series V, Overwise; and Series VI,
         Restricted Files, comprised of restricted material such as job
         applications, resumes, and salary information. Throughout the
         various series Harris's original filing system has been
         retained with some modifications. Folders are arranged
         chronologically or alphabetically within each series. The
         original internal order and titles of select folders has been
         retained.</p>
      <p>Series I: Public Relations Materials: This series' folders
         include Harris press releases, statements, 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Journal Messenger</title></bibref>columns, special reports, and newsletters. This
         series has been divided into four sections:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>A. Press Release (Boxes 1-8): This material was retained
            in its original folders and folder headings are arranged
            chronologically. These files generally do not provide
            substantive information about Harris's congressional
            activities or his views about legislation. They provide a
            brief overview of his position on various contemporary
            subjects.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>B. Statements (Boxes 8-9): These were retained in their
            original folders and arranged chronologically. They contain
            prepared statements for inclusion in the 
            <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Congressional Record</title></bibref>"Dear Colleague" letters, memoranda,
            correspondence and some press releases.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>C. 
            <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Journal Messenger</title></bibref>Columns (Box 10): These folders are arranged by
            year for Harris's column, "The Congressional Mail Bag."
            This weekly column featured sampling of constituent letters
            to Harris and his responses to them. These folders contain
            the unedited text of the columns, from the first one for
            the week of September 15, 1975 until August 8, 1980. In the
            front of several folders are indexes to the topic covered
            during the specific year.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>D. Special Reports and Newsletters (Box 11): These are
            in their original folders and are arranged chronologically.
            Each folder contains a finished report or newsletter with
            various drafts. The nature of a particular report or
            newsletter is indicated in the original folder headings.
            Reports or newsletters either deal primarily with a
            particular topic or are directed toward a specific
            constituency.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Series II: Correspondence: This series contains constituent
         mail, as well as correspondence with other legislators and
         government officials. Certain folders are arranged in reverse
         chronological order under a subseries A of the same name
         (Boxes 12-19); in subseries B, "Topical Correspondence" (Boxes
         20-66); or as subseries C, "Alphabetical Correspondence"
         (Boxes 67-70).</p>
      <p>Series III: Legislation Files: This series contains
         Harris's legislative activities as a member of the 94th, 95th
         and 96th Congresses, and is arranged into three general
         categories: Legislative Information Files, Subject Files, and
         Chronological Legislative Files. The Legislative Files are
         divided into five subseries:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>A. Legislative Information Files: These contain folders
            for Harris-sponsored legislation; empty ones are retained.
            House bills are filed first, in numerical order, followed
            by resolutions and joint resolutions (Boxes 71-81).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>B. Subject Files: These contain reports, "Dear
            Colleague" letters, memos, statements, and correspondence
            about various legislative topics. Subject folders differ
            from the legislative files in that the former are arranged
            only by general topics while each folder in the Legislative
            Information Files relates specifically to a particular bill
            (Boxes 82-99).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>C. Chronological Legislative Files: These files are
            self-explanatory; furthermore, they pertain to proposed or
            pending legislation but unlike subseries B (Subject Files)
            it is a miscellaneous grouping of materials (Box 100).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>D. Manassas National Battlefield Park Bill: Folders
            related to this legislation were transferred from
            throughout the collection and filed in this subseries for
            researcher convenience. It includes correspondence, and
            thanks to this measure the boundaries of the park were
            expanded by 1700 acres in order to protect it from
            encroaching commercial development (Boxes 101-104).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>E. Tenants' Tax Justice Bill: This folders were pulled
            from the collection for consolidation in this subseries.
            This bill sought to allow tenants to claim a tax deduction
            for that part of their rent which paid local property
            taxes, rather than allowing the tax deduction solely for
            the owners of rental units (Box 104).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Series IV: Photographs File: Self-explanatory (Box
         104).</p>
      <p>Series V: Oversize: Most of these items (in Oversize box
         M-3) are maps pertaining to the Manassas National Battlefield
         Park bill.</p>
      <p>Series VI: Restricted File: Materials such as job
         applications, resumes, and salary information are restricted.
         No access is allowed without the written consent of Mr. Harris
         (Boxes 105-107).</p>
