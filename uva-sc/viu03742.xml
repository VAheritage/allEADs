      <p>Alfred Phillip Fernbach (1915- ) was born in New Rochelle,
         New York. He married Jenny Christoffersen in 1941, and they
         had one son, Robert, born in 1947. Fernbach earned both the
         Ph.B. (1936) and the Ph.D. (1941) at the University of
         Wisconsin, where he also served as a guest lecturer on
         political science in 1944-45 and in the summer of 1947.</p>
      <p>In 1941, Fernbach came to the University of Virginia as an
         Instructor of Political Science, and by 1962 he had become
         Professor of Government and Foreign Affairs. He remained in
         that position until his retirement in May 1986 when he was
         elected professor Emeritus. He also served as Associate Dean
         of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences from 1971 to
         1976.</p>
      <p>Fernbach was a member of several national foreign studies
         organizations, including the Association for Asian Studies,
         the American Political Science Association, and the
         International Studies Association; he served the latter
         association as President of its Southern Division. He
         travelled extensively during the course of his academic
         pursuits, including stays as Fulbright Research Fellow with
         the Nobel Institute in Oslo (1950) and as Fulbright Lecturer
         at Karnatak University, Mysore, India (1961/62).</p>
      <p>Among his publications are "Southeast Asia Treaty
         Organization" in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Encyclopedia Americana</title>(1962)
         and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Soviet Coexistence Strategy, A Case
         Study of Experience in the International Labor
         Organization</title>(1960).</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Alfred Phillip Fernbach Papers (1959-1984) comprise
         approximately 400 items (.7 shelf feet) and include
         professional correspondence, departmental memoranda,
         curriculum proposals, department expenditure estimates, and
         plans for conferences and colloquia.</p>
      <p>Much of this material concerns the establishment,
         development and administration of the Asian Studies program at
         the University of Virginia. Included among the Asian Studies
         Committee items (1964-1981) are proposals for and
         correspondence about such an interdisciplinary coordinating
         body, and papers documenting Fernbach's tenure as the
         committee chairman (1968-1973). Also included with these
         committee files are specific proposals for an Asian Studies
         curriculum and faculty, as well as documentation of the
         committee's "Visitor-in-Depth" program (1969-1971), through
         which recognized authorities on Asia visited the University of
         Virginia for a several days at a time to meet with students
         and faculty.</p>
      <p>Another bundle of papers concerns the Virginia Asian
         Studies Consortium [VASC] of area institutions (Emory and
         Henry College, Hampton Institute, Mary Baldwin College, Mary
         Washington College, Old Dominion U., Randolph-Macon Women's
         College, the U. of Virginia, and Virginia State College) and
         Fernbach's involvement with the group. Documents range from
         the initial proposal for such a consortium in 1965 to a report
         of the VASC steering committee in 1984. Most items date from
         the late 1960s to the early 1970s and include colloquium
         programs, executive committee memoranda, a 1969 report on the
         resources of VASC, correspondence aimed at expanding VASC
         membership, and the by-laws drafted in 1973.</p>
      <p>A smaller group of Association for Asian Studies [AAS]
         files, chiefly correspondence, pertains principally to the
         southeastern regional activities of the society. Other papers
         and concern graduate school fellowship awards, including
         Diplomatic and Consular Officers, Retired [DACOR] fellowship
         criteria and selections for the 1978/79 session.</p>
      <p>None of these papers reflects any of Fernbach's specific
         classroom of research activities, nor are there any personal
         or family papers in the collection.</p>
