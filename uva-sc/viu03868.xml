</head>
      <p>The prime mover for the organization of the Virginia Philosophical Association was Professor Albert G.A. Balz, Head of the Corcoran School of Philosophy of the University of Virginia. He first suggested the
idea of an annual meeting of the philosophers of Virginia and was aided by Professor Majorie S. Harris of Randolph-Macon Woman's College and Dean James W. Miller of The College of William and Mary in arranging the
first meeting under the sponsorship of the Philosophy Club at the University of Virginia on November 25, 1939. In each of the subsequent years, a committee was set up to handle the arrangements for the following
year. The group did not meet for several years during World War II.

      <p>These papers have been described as a single collection but have retained their original accession number on each folder. They are arranged in chronological order according to the year of the meeting within
each accession number group. Some accessions have additional material other than the program, minutes, and correspondence pertaining to that year's meeting and they are filed chronologically within their accession
group as well.
