      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Much of the correspondence from William King to his wife,
         Anne, was written during the Civil War and describes some of
         his camp and battle experiences as a Confederate artilleryman,
         June 1861-April 1862. Apparently after serving two months as a
         gunner's mate in the naval battery at Manassas, King was
         transferred to the army artillery and attached to General
         Phillip St. George Cocke's brigade.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of twenty-seven items, ca.
         1844-1867, n.d., chiefly the correspondence of William King
         and his wife, Anne Leftwich King, of Saltville, Virginia, but
         also including Confederate money from Virginia and North
         Carolina (1862), a map of the British Isles and Europe with a
         genealogical notation (n.d.), and a printed sketch of William
         King (1769-1808), the original emigrant from Ireland
         (n.d.).</p>
      <p>In particular, King mentions their son, William, born on
         November 11, 1861, his membership in Latham's Battery, and an
         engagement with Federal troops near Centreville, Virginia, on
         December 18 (1861 December 19). After false reports of enemy
         activity at Fredericksburg, King believes they are to go by
         railroad to Richmond. He also writes about the death of his
         brother and wants his wife to write to his uncle Charlie to
         bring his remains to be buried at the Abingdon cemetery (1862
         April 10). Writing from Saltville, Virginia, King states that
         the four [salt?] furnaces are working very well (1863 Jun
         7).</p>
      <p>In a letter from Greenville, Tennessee, where King is
         trying to sell a train of ten cars loaded with salt, he
         describes the bad economic conditions of the area with nearly
         all of the business houses closed, with many of the citizens
         having left the area with the Federal army, almost no
         livestock to be seen between Greenville and Bristol, many
         cases of "bushwhacking" perpetrated by deserters from both
         armies of the Civil War, the occurrence of smallpox in the
         Union army and in the local hospital, General Longstreet's
         army advancing slowly towards Knoxville, and his concern to
         have their daughter, Lizzie, vaccinated against smallpox (1864
         January 30).</p>
      <p>King, having bought a carload of leather in Wytheville,
         arrived in Saltville, Virginia, where he loaded three train
         cars with salt to take on into Tennessee. He was unable to
         leave right away because the railroad water tanks were frozen
         and could not furnish water for their extra train. When able
         to leave, King hoped to travel as far as New Market,
         Tennessee, where General James Longstreet had his present
         headquarters (1864 February 19). He mentions that, if the
         Legislature should adopt the suggestions of its joint
         committee as to the seizure of the Charles Scott Salt Furnace
         to be worked by Mr. Clarkson for the benefit of the state and
         the Confederacy, he will have to enter the army (1864 March
         6).</p>
      <p>King, apparently serving in the army again, writes from a
         camp near Saltville, Virginia, of the passage of Generals
         Jubal Early and John Echols by Glade Spring towards Bristol,
         of reports of Yankees in Tennessee moving towards Saltville or
         North Carolina, of everybody capable of bearing arms being
         called upon to report for duty, that his artillery pieces have
         not arrived from Wytheville, and says of Lee's army, "General
         Lee's army may be disintegrated but each fragment will
         constitute a guerilla band who will fight on and live by the
         plunder of friend and foe" (1865 Mar 25).</p>
      <p>Other letters include material on the King and Leftwich
         families, on local salt works, and other economic and social
         conditions in southwestern Virginia and East Tennessee.
         William King, Jr. writes to his sister, Sarah C. King, about
         the death of their youngest brother (1844 Jul 19); and John
         Ramage writes three letters to William King, on business
         matters concerning the salt works (1848 August 16, September
         11, &amp; 1850 February 6).</p>
