        <p>The original Jefferson Davis Norris collection was given
            to the University by Dudley Page Cotton and Miss Martha
            Norris of Medomak, Maine, in July, 1946, which Mrs. Cotton
            subsequently expanded with additional materials received 30
            May 1952 (2454-a), and to which Mrs. Cotton added the
            papers of William Norris (2562) on 3 December 1946. The
            letter of 1880 February 20 from Jefferson Davis to William
            Norris remains the property of Mrs. Dudley Page Cotton,
            Jr., and Mr. Jefferson Cabell Cotton.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Norris Family Papers, 1661-1942, have been divided into
         four major sections, the papers of Colonial William Norris,
         the papers of Jefferson Davis Norris, the papers of members of
         J. D. Norris' immediate family, and the papers of other
         families that are distantly related to the Norrises.</p>
      <p>The papers, 1857-1896, of William Norris, Colonel in the
         Signal Corps of the Confederate Army, contain primarily
         business letters and invitations. An 1880 letter from Col.
         Norris to Jefferson Davis and Davis' reply have been placed in
         a separate folder. The rest of Col. Norris' correspondence has
         been arranged chronologically. There is also a scrapbook
         containing newspaper clippings on miscellaneous topics.</p>
      <p>The papers, 1880-1942, of Jefferson Davis Norris, a
         Maryland lawyer who received his degree in 1890 from the
         University of Virginia are further broken down into four
         sub-divisions. First, there is the correspondence of J. D.
         Norris with various members of his immediate family which has
         been arranged genealogically as follows: correspondence with
         his father, Col. William Norris, with his mother, Ellen
         Norris; with his brother, William Catesby Norris; with his
         sisters, Sarita M. and Susan F. Norris; with his wife Cabell
         Norris; and with his daughters, Josephine and Martha Jefferson
         "Bee" Norris. Correspondence with his mother and with his
         brother contain colorful descriptions of life at the
         University of Virginia in the 1890s. Personal correspondence
         with various friends follows his family correspondence. Where
         the quantity of correspondence has warranted it, individual
         correspondence has also been broken down by decade and runs
         chronologically.</p>
      <p>The second sub-section of J. D. Norris' papers consists of
         his business correspondence. This is arranged chronologically
         by decade with certain correspondence pulled and placed in
         separate folders because of its quantity or because of its
         topical interest. Norris' business letters during the thirties
         in particular indicate the troubles and turmoils of a once
         well-to-do lawyer trying to face up to the hardships of the
         Great Depression. Norris' letters reveal a certain bitterness
         about his financial difficulties but also an unfailing wit
         that he used against businesses that he used against
         businesses that he believed were trying to cheat him,
         particularly the exchange of letters and "legal briefs"
         between Norris and the Consolidated Gas, Electric Light and
         Power Company. Six folders of bills and receipts, arranged
         chronologically by decade, follow the business
         correspondence.</p>
      <p>The third sub-division consists of Norris' legal and
         political correspondence which is arranged chronologically and
         within the respective folders.</p>
      <p>Fourthly, miscellaneous items of Norris are arranged
         topically, from a folder of newspaper clippings, to
         miscellaneous pamphlets to unaddressed postcards.</p>
      <p>The third major section of the Norris family papers
         consists of the correspondence of members of J. D. Norris'
         immediate family (minus their correspondence with J. D.
         Norris). Again, these have been arranged genealogically as
         follows: that of Mrs. William M. and Susan F. Norris; that of
         William Catesby Norris; that of Sarita M. and Susan F. Norris;
         that of Cabell Norris; and that of Josephine, and Martha
         Jefferson Norris. The significant portion of this section are
         the letters Ellen Norris wrote to her parents from Richmond
         apparantly during Grant's siege. The papers of other Norris'
         have been placed chronologically following the regular Norris
         family correspondence. The family papers also include various
         cloth items, notebooks and photographs. Of particular interest
         is the undated civil war material.</p>
      <p>Related family papers consist of a few letters, 1861-1875,
         of George Gardner Hobson and his wife Sarah and several
         letters, 1863-1920, of the Della Torre family. Particularly
         interesting among the latter are the letters from Frank Della
         Torre to his mother Mrs. P. Della Torre written during the
         1870s while Frank was a student at the University of Virginia.
         These two family collections are arranged chronologically.</p>
      <p>Also included in th eother family papers are eighteenth and
         nineteenth century legal documents of the Arnold Smith and
         Whipple families. These are broken down by family,
         chronologically by decade within the family division.</p>
