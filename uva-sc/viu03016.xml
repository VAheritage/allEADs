James Hardy Dillard was born in Nansemond County, Virginia October 24, 1856 and died in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 2, 1940.  He was the son of James and Sara Cross Dillard. He married Mary Harmanson of Norfolk, Virginia on July 5, 1882.  He married Avarene Lippincott Budd of Mt. Holly, New Jersey on November 19, 1899.
</p>
         <p>
Dillard graduated from Washington and Lee University in 1876 and taught mathematics there for a year.  From 1877 to 1882, he served as principal of the Rodman School in Norfolk, Virginia.  Between 1882 and 1891, he served as joint principal of Norfolk Academy and as a faculty member at the following institutions: the University of Vermont, Phillips Exeter Academy, the State Normal School in Oswego, New York, and Mary Institute, the woman's department of Washington University in St. Louis.
</p>
         <p>
Dillard was appointed professor of Latin at Tulane University in New Orleans in 1891. In 1904, he was selected to serve as dean of the academic colleges, a position he held until 1907. While in New Orleans, Dillard became deeply involved in numerous social and educational endeavors and worked for improved race relations and educational opportunities for African Americans. He was chosen to be the first president and director of the Negro Rural School Fund (a.k.a. the Anna T. Jeanes Fund), positions he held from 1907 until 1931.  From 1910 to 1917, Dillard served as the director of the John F. Slater Fund; from 1917 until 1931 he served as the Fund's president.  At various times, Dillard served on the board of the Phelps Stokes Fund, Leland University, Southern University, Straight University, and New Orleans University. Dillard University, formed in 1934 from the merger of Straight and New Orleans universities, was named in Dillard's honor.

               <p>Brawley encloses a card [not present] with notes about appropriations from the Slater Fund and asks Dillard "just what is the point about Shaw?" He says that the "actual working of the system makes no real difference in the teacher's salary." He says that he is paid from the college office like all other Shaw employees and that "Shaw now has no special Slater teacher." Brawley has received material from Thomas Jesse Jones and "Mr. Kearny" and hopes to have the manuscript to the publisher by March.

               <p>Brawley asks if Dillard has "an unpublished paper on your impressions of Africa" and mentions other material he has recently read. He still hopes to have the manuscript to the publisher for fall publication. Brawley says that he understands the purpose of the Slater Fund assistance is "to help raise the general standard by seeing to it that at least one teacher is adequately paid."  He says that he is receiving &#x0024;250 less than Dillard intended and has never been paid more than &#x0024;2000 "at any place at which I have taught." He "could not exist if it were not for summer work or an occasional article. But there is also the moral question if I have been treated justly." Brawley asks Dillard for his assistance.

He explains that he asked Mr. Newbold to read the introduction.  Brawley tells Dillard that Newbold's son is on trial for hitting and killing a man with his automobile.  He then tells Dillard that the "Negro bank, a branch of the one in Durham," was robbed of &#x0024;4000 but fortunately there was no run on the bank "for the Negroes of Raleigh, by way of showing their confidence, made special deposits and drew out very little money." The loss is covered by insurance and the "white banks in the city were quick to offer any assistance needed." Brawley closes by saying "Hampton is at present a case of lack of coherence. It is hard to write about the situation there; but if there should be opportunity at any time soon, I should be glad to talk it over."

Brawley says he has no interest in assuming administrative duties at Shaw. "The institution has a cantankerous and selfish local alumni group that has fought the president mercilessly. Several members of the faculty are not assets. No college in the country is more in need of buildings. . . ." He closes by saying that "only a stern sense of duty" would compel him to "take up the burden" of reform at Shaw if asked.

               <p>Brawley discusses the book illustrations and chapter titles. He mentions the situation at Shaw University and says the president returned from the trustees meeting "somewhat depressed." Brawley says there is a rumor that the president will resign "in the near future." He says that to put the alumni group "in power here would be infinitely worse than any mistake the president has made." The typed note from Dillard's secretary acknowledges receipt of Brawley's letter.

"Dr. Smith of the Home Mission Society" was in Raleigh a month ago to review the situation and spoke at some length with Brawley. Brawley says there is to be a special trustees meeting in New York "on Thursday of this week." He hopes something will be done "for the college is suffering." One of the major issues is the "field secretary, appointed two years ago at the request of the alumni." There is a deficit of &#x0024;4000 for the secretary's salary, which was supposed to be made up by July 1.

"The situation at Shaw is far from good" but Brawley is hopeful about it. The trustees accepted the resignation of the president and will allow the field secretary to remain, but the alumni will be responsible for his salary. A committee has been appointed to hire a new president "and it has corrected a recent report by making it clear that it is perfectly free in its choice as between a white man and a Negro."

Peacock is thoroughly in charge" at Shaw this winter and is "counting on the Slater appropriation." Brawley mentions that he gave Revell a list of newspapers to receive press copies of the book. He encloses two letters [not present] praising the book.

               <p>Brawley thanks Dillard for the report on his trip to Jamaica; it interested Mrs. Brawley very much since she was born there. Brawley has sent a copy of the book to Mr. Embree in hopes of interesting Mr. Rosenwald in it. Brawley mentions that "Dr. Smith of the Home Mission Society" was at Shaw recently. Brawley thanks Dillard for his support and says he is not interested in taking "charge of the college." He says he "can see no hope unless Shaw can have at once an unusually progressive administration and secure at least &#x0024;600,000 for new buildings." Should the Guggenheim fellowship come through, Brawley would hope to go on to a different position at its conclusion.

Brawley is unable to advance the money; he has asked "Mr. Roy" if the Phelps Stokes Fund would be able to do so but has not had a reply. He asks Dillard if "through the Jeanes Fund or otherwise that you will be able to help to move a considerable portion of 500 copies within the next three or four months?"  He closes by saying that he and Mrs. Brawley "are very glad that we heeded your advice to leave Raleigh immediately."

He is not allowing the type to be dispersed in case another printing is needed. Brawley will have most of the copies of the new printing and will fill orders for more than a single copy. Brawley says that if the "book is worth anything in race relations" it would be "most effective if put to work in some of the smaller cities and towns throughout the South." He would like to have copies sent "to at least a few hundred small town principals, both white and colored, but mainly white. Many of these men do not buy many new books and they would talk about something like this much more than a college president."

               <p>Brawley thanks Dillard for sending a copy of his article, "Teachers and Reading" and says it reminds him "more and more why I have been attracted to your work."  Dillard's interest is in all children and Brawley says "[s]o is mine." He says that he has "always been thrilled by what was being done by Miss Martha Berry and others for the white boys and girls in the mountains." Brawley says that five or six years ago he "conceived the idea that my final work as a teacher was to cultivate better reading habits on the part of Negro boys and girls throughout the South."  He presented the idea to the General Education Board. He hoped to "see as closely as possible just what books were available for reading in hundreds of schools throughout the South. Then I wanted to select and supply ten or twenty books as the individual case might require." He believed a foundation, on the order of the Jeanes Fund, would be required to effect his plan, but he received little encouragement. "It is far easier to get a hundred thousand for a building than for anything that goes more directly into character building."

               <p>Brawley has heard that Dillard has been sick and hopes he is "a great deal better." He understands that Dillard is "heading the Scottsboro Committee" and can "hardly imagine a more patriotic service." Brawley's new book, <title render="italic">Early Negro American Writers</title>, is to be published by the University of North Carolina Press in about two months.

               <p>Brawley is glad to hear Dillard's health has improved and thanks him for sending "the reprinted articles" [not present]. Brawley also thanks Dillard for the inscribed copy of Dillard's book, <title render="italic">From News Stand to Cyrano</title>. Brawley says "a few designing men have recently launched a new attack on the administration at Howard, but I am happy to tell you that the tide is now strongly in President Johnson's favor." Brawley and several other Howard faculty members recently attended a special dinner at the Willard Hotel. The Secretary of the Interior was present and Brawley has since sent him a copy of <title render="italic">Doctor Dillard of the Jeanes Fund</title>.

               <p>Brawley thanks Dillard again for the inscribed copy of <title render="italic">From News Stand to Cyrano</title> and says that if Dillard has extra copies of any of his earlier works, Brawley would appreciate receiving them. Brawley say that he is "trying to get together as many things as I can in the field of Negro literature. The emphasis is not so much on history or the so-called problem, but literature." He says he has most of James Weldon Johnson's books and many by younger writers but the earlier generation's books are much hard to come by. "Just think of the fact that the little book, <title render="italic">Oak and Ivy</title>, that young Dunbar used to beg people on his elevator to buy, is now worth ten or twelve dollars and can hardly be had for either love or money." Brawley mentions that he has most of Dunbar's works, as well as a copy of the 1773 edition of Phillis Wheatley's <title render="italic">Poems on Various Subjects</title>. He mentions other authors including Charles Chesnutt, W.E.B. Du Bois, Alexander Crummell, William Wells Brown, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Joel Chandler Harris, Walter Hines Page and William Garrott Brown. Brawley says that "in the wider field of literature" he has "what must be (if I can believe the dealers) the best Le Gallienne collection in this part of the world." Brawley concludes with a discussion of "the biographical series that I have under way with the University of North Carolina Press."

               <p>Having "just graded the last examination papers and made out my report" Brawley finds himself "thinking about the meaning of it all."  He said he has especially thought of Dillard and his "paper about the early days in Norfolk, 'A School of the Past.'" Brawley hopes Dillard is well.

               <p>Brawley thanks Dillard for the check and his interest in Brawley's publications. He says that at least two of his book are out of print "so that I shall doubtless have to send not just one or two but several books other than my own to make up the difference." He says "it may be that I can help Miss Carothers with a few items I have recently seen here in second hand stores." Brawley recently attended "a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Encyclopedia. . . and there were several kind references to you." A postscript in Brawley's hand says that the Committee "voted to invite Professor Guy B. Johnson to be co-editor with Dr. Du Bois."

               <p>Brawley has "to-day sent to Miss Carothers at Dillard University two packages containing the books listed on separate sheet" [p.2]. Brawley says this "has reminded me of two dreams I had but that are still unrealized. One was to preside over a fund of about half a million for the purchase of books for needy schools and communities. The other was to have for Negro boys an academy, a secondary school with the highest standards of scholarship and character."
