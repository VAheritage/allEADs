   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The Dos Passos papers at the University of Virginia present
     a vivid chronicle of the author's activities, thoughts and
     literary skills as he analyzed, reported on and criticized the
     turbulent events of the 20th century. Dos Passos, identifying
     with the leftist radical sympathies of the post-World War I
     period, experimented in expressing these sentiments with
     innovative writing techniques in some of his most important
     and successful works: 
     <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">One Man's Initiation--1917</title> (1920), 
     <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Three Soldiers</title>  (1921), 
     <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Manhattan Transfer</title>  (1925) and
     the trilogy, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">USA</title>  (<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The 42nd Parallel,</title>  1930; <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Nineteen Nineteen,</title>  1932; 
     <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Big Money,</title>  1936).</p>
   <p>The collection highlights the Dos Passos chronicle
     principally through a large body of manuscripts, letters and
     other personal and family related papers that have been
     assembled at the University of Virginia over the past 40 years
     from a series of gifts from Dos Passos and later, from his
     widow Elizabeth, and his daughter Lucy Dos Passos Coggin. Also
     included is a small quantity of gift acquisitions from several
     close friends and associates.</p>
   <p>The major portion of the papers is comprised of manuscript
     material (published and unpublished) of most of his novels,
     plays, poems, articles, speeches, lectures, readings and his
     reportage on history, politics, society and travel. Included
     are corrected and uncorrected typescripts, galley and page
     proofs, notes, outlines, related research material and an
     extensive assemblage of publisher and literary agent
     correspondence. Of particular interest are his diaries and
     notebooks filled with recorded observations, thoughts, verse
     and sketches that may have served as the basis for some of the
     character development and themes found in his published
     writings and in his works of art.</p>
   <p>Another large part of the collection contains letters
     written to him over his lifetime from close friends, literary
     associates and random correspondents which comprise a
     narrative, of sorts, of the conflicting political, social and
     cultural ideas that he and others of his generation grappled
     with in the period between the two World Wars. Letters from
     his close friends and literary associates include, among
     others, those from E.E. Cummings, Ernest Hemingway, John
     Howard Lawson, Archibald MacLeish, Walter Rumsey Marvin,
     Gerald Murphy, Dudley Poore and Edmund Wilson.</p>
   <p>The balance of the collection consists of Dos Passos family
     papers, along with a small assortment of other miscellaneous
     material. The family papers contain correspondence Dos Passos
     exchanged with his parents, his wife Katharine and other
     collateral relatives. Included among Dos Passos' personal
     papers are financial, legal, and household data; mementos of
     his awards and honors; originals and copies of his drawings
     and paintings; articles and newsclips about his life and his
     writings; and a collection of photographs of his childhood
     years, portraits and snapshots of him as a young adult and
     family photographs of the period 1950 through 1960. In later
     years, Dos Passos turned from the radicalism of his youth. He
     settled in the family home in Westmoreland County in northern
     Virginia with his wife Elizabeth Holdridge Dos Passos and
     their daughter Lucy where he continued to pursue, with his
     characteristic vigor, the engagement of his new found
     political and social ideas into his writings, lectures and
     speeches.</p>
   <p>He died on September 28, 1970 and remains as one of the
     pre-eminent writers of the 20th century.</p>

     Court, the recognition of Cuba, woman suffrage and the war in
     Europe. His papers also include a number of autograph signed
     letters from some of the notable personalities of the period:
     William Borah, William Jennings Bryan, Josephus Daniels, Jay
     Gould, Benjamin Harrison, Charles Evans Hughes, Henry Cabot
     Lodge and Woodrow Wilson. The papers of Dos
     Passos' first wife, Katharine contain a number of her
     short story manuscripts and correspondence that includes

     writings. Included also are Dos Passos family photographs and
