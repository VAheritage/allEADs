      <p>Marcus Wright was born in 1831 in Tennessee and later
         became a court clerk in Memphis and colonel of the 154th
         Tennessee Militia. Following the outbreak of the Civil War he
         joined the Confederacy and was appointed military governor of
         Columbus, Kentucky, in 1862 and fought at the battles of
         Shiloh and Perryville while a member of General Benjamin
         Franklin Cheatham's (1820-1886) staff. Wright was promoted to
         brigadier general in December, 1862, and participated in the
         1864 Atlanta Campaign.</p>
      <p>In 1878 Wright was appointed as an agent to assist in the
         collecting of Confederate records for inclusion in the most
         important single source of Civil War documents, 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the
            Official Records of the Union and Confederate
            Armies</title></bibref>, Series I-IV, 128 volumes (Washington: 1881-1901);
         at that time the work was being published under the auspices
         of the "Publication Office, War Records 1861-'65" in the U. S.
         War Department. Wright sought to remedy the distrust
         Southerners felt toward the Federal government and to persuade
         them to donate or loan their war-related documents for the
         project (he and other ex-Confederates were also appointed to
         insure impartiality for the Confederacy). He also contributed
         several writings on the war including 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">General Officers of the Confederate Army</title></bibref>(New York: The Neale Publishing Company, 1911).
         General Wright died on December 22, 1922, and was buried in
         Arlington National Cemetery.</p>

        <head>Scope and Content</head>
        <p>This remarkable collection of five items, 1872-1901,
            pertains to General 
            <persname>Marcus J. Wright</persname>(1831-1922), author of
            the pioneering study, 
            <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">General Officers of the Confederate Army</title></bibref>. Three letters and two bound volumes, one of
            which is Wright's annotated manuscript of his book, are
            present; each is described separately in this guide.</p>
      </scopecontent>
      <scopecontent>
        <head>The Bound Volumes and Letters</head>
        <p>The collection includes a bound carbon copy, ca. 1911,
            of Wright's manuscript of 
            <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">General Officers of The Confederate Army</title></bibref>. The manuscript bears numerous annotations,
            corrections, and revisions in his handwriting as well as
            his personal bookplate on the inside front cover. Three
            loose letters were filed in this volume. A March 14, 1872
            letter, former Confederate General 
            <persname>Braxton Bragg</persname>(1817-1876), writing from
            <geogname>Mobile, Alabama</geogname>, was in response to a
            previous letter (not present) from Wright. Bragg discusses
            his appointment as brigadier general [March 10, 1861], his
            assignment to 
            <geogname>Pensacola, Florida</geogname>, while a major
            general of 
            <geogname>Louisiana</geogname>'s state forces, his
            appointment as a major general in the Confederate Army on
            September 12, 1861, and to the rank of general, April 12,
            1862. He concludes with the comment: "The record when
            complete will be of great interest and should be in the
            hands of every Southern child."</p>
        <p>The second letter is dated August 3, 1880, and was
            written by Wright in Washington, D. C., to 
            <persname>George Washington Custis
            Lee</persname>(1832-1913), the eldest son of the
            Confederate general-in-chief 
            <persname>Robert E. Lee</persname>. As an "Agent for War
            Department" he seeks Lee's assistance in obtaining papers
            of his father in the possession of Colonel 
            <persname>Charles Marshall</persname>(1830-1902) of
            Baltimore, for inclusion in 
            <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">The War of The Rebellion</title></bibref>. (Marshall had been R. E. Lee's military
            secretary and aide-de-camp.) In the third letter, 
            <persname>G. W. C. Lee</persname>, writing from Lexington,
            Virginia, on August 24, 1880, apprises Marshall of the
            request. Lee claims to have informed Wright that Marshall
            was in the process of preparing a study of the Army of
            Northern Virginia and of how inconvenient it would be for
            him (Marshall) to have the papers copied while he was still
            in the process of consulting them for his own historical
            research.</p>
        <p>The final item is 
            <persname>Ezra J. Warner</persname>'s personal copy of 
            <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">General Officers Of The Confederate Army</title></bibref>; his bookplate is on the inside front cover.
            Warner was the author of 
            <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Generals In Gray</title></bibref>(1959), the study which superseded Wright's book.
            Warner's copy is heavily annotated in his handwriting
            (pencil and ink) with corrections, paste-ins, and a
            separate six-page typed index of 
            <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">General Officers</title></bibref>. This index indicates the presence or absence of
            the individual generals in the 
            <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Dictionary of American Biography</title></bibref>.</p>
