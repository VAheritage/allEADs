        <p>The main accession (#8319) was a gift of Mr. John
            Hundley on May 20, 1967. Mr. Hundley served as Boothe's
            office manager for the campaign in the
            Charlottesville-Albemarle area. Mr. Boothe gave the second
            collection of his papers which were received on July 25,
            1973.</p>

      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Armistead L. Boothe was born in Alexandria, Virginia on
         September 23, 1907. He attended Episcopal High School and the
         University of Virginia where he received his A.B. in 1928. He
         was chosen as a Rhodes scholar in 1929 and received a B.A. in
         Jurisprudence from Oxford University in 1931.</p>
      <p>In October, 1931, Boothe commenced the practice of law in
         his father's firm in Alexandria, Boothe, Dudley, Koontz,
         Blakenship &amp; Stump. He served as a lawyer for the
         Department of Justice 1934-1936, and Alexandria City Attorney
         1938-1943. After serving in the Untited States Naval Reserve,
         1943-1945, as an Air Combat Intelligence Officer, he returned
         to private practice.</p>
      <p>In 1934 Boothe married Elizabeth Ravenel Peelle of
         Washington, D.C. and they have three daughters, Julie Perry,
         Eleanor Smith and Elizabeth Davis.</p>
      <p>Boothe was elected to his first term in the Virginia House
         of Delegates in 1948 to which he was re-elected until 1955 and
         from 1956-1963 he represented Alexandria in the State Senate.
         A life long Democrat, Boothe aided the Kennedy-Johnson
         campaign effort in Virginia in 1960, served as chairman of the
         Tenth Congressional District Democratic Committee from
         1964-1968, in 1968 he headed Robert Kennedy's campaign in
         Virginia. In 1961 he made an unsuccessful bid for Lt. Governor
         on the ticket with A. E. S. Stephens and T. Munford Boyd and
         he lost a 1966 bid for the United States Senate to Harry F.
         Byrd, Jr. by a very small margin. While in the legislature
         Boothe was classified as a militant moderate and is best
         remembered for his consistent fight after 1954 to keep open
         the public schools of Virginia.</p>
      <p>After his loss to Byrd, Boothe retired from the active
         political arena, although he continued to help in state
         campaigns through the 1969 election. At the present time, the
         former politician is Director of Development for Virginia
         Episcopal Seminary in Alexandria.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of material from two accessions,
         8319 &amp; 8319-a, and includes political correspondence,
         campaign material, speeches, papers of his work on legislative
         committees and special sessions, and copies of book
         reviews.</p>
      <p>The main collection (8319) consists of campaign material
         and clippings related to Boothe's campaign for the United
         States Senate in 1966. There is also a small amount of
         material directly related to this campaign in the later
         accession (8319-a).</p>
      <p>The later accession is the larger of the two and included
         all the other political papers mentioned above. Although
         pertinent correspondence is sparse, the papers relating to the
         various campaigns give the best details of Boothe's early
         career in Alexandria or his service in the House of Delegates.
         Another excellent source of information on Boothe's career are
         the papers pertaining to the legislative committees on which
         he served and his papers of the special sessions on school
         integration in which he tried to effect a compromise that
         would both keep Virginia's public schools open and satisfy the
         Supreme Court order of Brown v. Board of Education. Again
         pertinent correspondence is scarce, but other files relating
         to constitutional questions and education supply a great deal
         of relevant material.</p>
      <p>The correspondence files run from 1951-1962, but there are
         large spans of time for which there is no correspondence, and
         many others for which there are only a few letters. The only
         time span with a relatively complete file runs from April 1960
         through December 1962. The nature of all correspondence in the
         collection is political.</p>
      <p>The photographs, speeches, and clippings found within the
         papers are also of a political nature. Some of the papers deal
         strictly with fund raising and general political activities to
         aid the Democratic party. The only personal papers of any sort
         are the book reviews written for a Washington newspaper, a
         certificate awarded to his mother, Mrs. Gardner Boothe's
         estate, and several speeches.</p>
      <p>The papers may be disappointing to a researcher because of
         the lack of continuity in correspondence and general
         information on Mr. Boothe's activities during regular
         legislative sessions, or his relations with other legislators.
         The researcher may find his only aid for this information
         would be the extensive collection of clippings included in the
         papers. However, any research on the educational problems
         introduced in Virginia by the Brown v. Board of Education
         decision of the Supreme Court should be greatly aided by the
         collection, as it was of primary interest to Boothe.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement>
      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The main accession and the additional accession have been
         kept as separate collections. The first group of papers were
         left in the order in which they were received. The clippings
         had been placed together, information on Byrd is in the same
         file with campaign materials such as photographs, list of
         precinct organization, sample ballots and advertisements. The
         last items are correspondence and the paper work of the
         campaign.</p>
      <p>As much as possible, the additional group of papers have
         also been left in the order in which they were received. The
         files have been placed in alphabetical order; the material
         within each folder has been left in chronological order as it
         was received. Where there are several files under the same
         headings, the files are placed in chronological order within
         the file, i.e. all campaign files are placed together, but in
         the chronological order in which they took place.</p>
