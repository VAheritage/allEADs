      <p>Brigadier General James Morrison Hawes (1824-1889) was a
         colonel of the Second Kentucky Cavalry at the beginning of the
         Civil War but resigned to accept a major's commission in the
         Confederate Army. He was promoted at the request of General
         Albert Sidney Johnston and fought at Shiloh and Milliken's
         Bend during the Vicksburg campaign. He later commanded
         Confederate forces fortifying Galveston Island, Texas.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant General Theophilus Hunter Holmes (1804-1880) was
         a veteran of the Seminole and Mexican wars. He was promoted to
         brigadier general in June 1861, then to major general in
         October of the same year. He commanded a brigade at First
         Manassas and a division during the Seven Days' battles.
         Although he was named commander of the Trans-Mississippi
         Department and promoted to lieutenant general in 1862, he
         asked his West Point (1829) classmate and friend Confederate
         President Jefferson Davis to relieve him of command. Holmes
         later became commander of North Carolina's reserve troops
         during 1864.</p>
      <p>Major General Fitzhugh Lee (1835-1905) was a nephew of
         Robert E. Lee and a veteran of Indian campaigns. His earliest
         service during the war was as a lieutenant colonel of the
         First Virginia Cavalry in 1861. He was promoted to brigadier
         general in 1862 and to major general in 1863. Lee commanded
         the cavalry forces in many of the major battles and campaigns
         of the Army of Northern Virginia until his surrender to Union
         forces at Farmville, Virginia. He served as governor of
         Virginia from 1886 to 1890, and as a major general in the
         United States Army during the Spanish-American War.</p>
      <p>Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan (1825-1864) was a
         veteran of the Mexican War and organized the Lexington Rifles
         (as part of the Kentucky militia) in 1857. They joined the
         Confederacy after the war began and he was promoted to
         brigadier general in 1862. Morgan led a series of cavalry
         raids into Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee before his
         capture and imprisonment in the Ohio State Penitentiary in
         July 1863. He escaped during the following November and was
         appointed commander of the Department of Southwest Virginia
         but was killed by Federal forces on September 4, 1864.
         Morgan's carte-de-visite shows him in a blue uniform, and was
         probably taken during his pre-war Mexican or militia
         service.</p>
      <p>Brigadier General Isaac Munroe St. John (1827-1880) was a
         graduate from Yale and served as chief engineer to General
         John B. Magruder during the Peninsular campaign before
         becoming chief of the Mining and Nitre Bureau in May 1862 with
         the rank of major. He was promoted to brigadier general and
         commissary general in February 1865.</p>
      <p>Clement Laird Vallandigham (1820-1871) was a Democratic
         politician from Ohio who became a leader of the Copperheads
         (Northern Democrats opposed to the Civil War and the policies
         of the Federal government). He was a candidate for governor of
         Ohio in 1863 and was banished from the Union by Abraham
         Lincoln for his speeches and activities against the war. He
         was summarily expelled from the Confederacy after criticizing
         the Confederate government's handling of its military and
         political efforts.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection, ca. 1860-1865, contains seven items,
         chiefly cartes-de-visite of five Confederate generals and one
         of Clement L. Vallandigham, an Ohio politician, and an
         unmounted salt print photograph of a group of Union
         soldiers.</p>
      <p>The salt print is of a drill formation of a ca. forty Union
         soldiers (in California?) and armed with muskets; there is a
         drummer boy at center and three officers standing in front of
         the enlisted men. Many of the men are wearing white
         gloves.</p>
