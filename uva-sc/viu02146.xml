      <p>Brigadier General James Morrison Hawes (1824-1889) was a
         colonel of the Second Kentucky Cavalry at the beginning of the
         Civil War but resigned to accept a major's commission in the
         Confederate Army. He was promoted at the request of General
         Albert Sidney Johnston and fought at Shiloh and Milliken's
         Bend during the Vicksburg campaign. He later commanded
         Confederate forces fortifying Galveston Island, Texas.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant General Theophilus Hunter Holmes (1804-1880) was
         a veteran of the Seminole and Mexican wars. He was promoted to
         brigadier general in June 1861, then to major general in
         October of the same year. He commanded a brigade at First
         Manassas and a division during the Seven Days' battles.
         Although he was named commander of the Trans-Mississippi
         Department and promoted to lieutenant general in 1862, he
         asked his West Point (1829) classmate and friend Confederate
         President Jefferson Davis to relieve him of command. Holmes
         later became commander of North Carolina's reserve troops
         during 1864.</p>
      <p>Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan (1825-1864) was a
         veteran of the Mexican War and organized the Lexington Rifles
         (as part of the Kentucky militia) in 1857. They joined the
         Confederacy after the war began and he was promoted to
         brigadier general in 1862. Morgan led a series of cavalry
         raids into Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee before his
         capture and imprisonment in the Ohio State Penitentiary in
         July 1863. He escaped during the following November and was
         appointed commander of the Department of Southwest Virginia
         but was killed by Federal forces on September 4, 1864.
         Morgan's carte-de-visite shows him in a blue uniform, and was
         probably taken during his pre-war Mexican or militia
         service.</p>
      <p>Clement Laird Vallandigham (1820-1871) was a Democratic
         politician from Ohio who became a leader of the Copperheads
         (Northern Democrats opposed to the Civil War and the policies
         of the Federal government). He was a candidate for governor of
         Ohio in 1863 and was banished from the Union by Abraham
         Lincoln for his speeches and activities against the war. He
         was summarily expelled from the Confederacy after criticizing
         the Confederate government's handling of its military and
         political efforts.</p>
