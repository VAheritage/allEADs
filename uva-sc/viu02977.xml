      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>These 55 letters (original and electrostatic copies),
         1961-1990, are chiefly between Arnold Whitridge and John O.
         Waller concerning Matthew Arnold and other literary figures
         and related subjects. Whitridge was born on June 29, 1891 in
         New Rochelle, New York, to Frederick Wallingford and Lucy
         (Arnold) Whitridge, and was the grandson of Matthew Arnold. He
         received his A.B. at Yale in 1913, A.M. at Oxford in 1914, and
         his Ph.D. at Columbia in 1925. He was an educator and author
         whose books include 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Critical Ventures in Modern French
         Literature</title>(1924), 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Dr. Arnold of Rugby</title>(1928), 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Simon Bolivar</title>(1954), 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">No Compromise</title>(1960), and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Rochambeau</title>(1965). John Oscar
         Waller was born on October 29, 1916, in Los Angeles,
         California, to David Oscar and Susan Veva (Williams) Waller.
         He received his B.A. at San Diego State College in 1941, his
         M.A. at the University of Southern California in 1949 and
         1954. He taught at San Diego State College, Walla Walla
         College in Washington, and Andrews University in Michigan.
         Membership includes Modern Language Association of America,
         Victorial Periodicals, and the Tennyson Society.</p>
      <p>Letters from April 1961 through February 1962 discuss
         Waller's articles "Matthew Arnold and the Civil War" and on
         Edward Dicey's reporting of the Civil War, and his interest in
         Thomas Arnold. In June 1962, Waller mentions reading with
         great interest Whitridge's book 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">No Compromise</title>. Letters in
         November and December 1962 refer to Waller's article on John
         Stuart Mill and Whitridge's article "British Liberals in the
         Civil War," including a discussion of Northern sympathizers.
         Waller sent articles (not included) on "Matthew Arnold and the
         American Civil War," 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Victorian Newsletter</title>(January
         21, 1963) and Charles Kingsley (November 1, 1963). On May 16,
         1965, Whitridge discusses Waller's review of [Thomas] Carlyle,
         including the Civil War, the Union and the Confederacy. On
         August 2, 1966, Waller mentions studies of Matthew and Thomas
         Arnold and having met Arthur Kyle Davis of this University.
         Waller's article on "Rugby Chapel" is mentioned several times
         between January 1969 and February 1970. In his letter of
         January 21, 1969, Waller reveals that his article demonstrates
         Arnold's use, in his poem "Rugby Chapel," of metaphor and
         other imagery derived from the sermons of Thomas Arnold.
         During February and April 1969, they comment on Edward
         Alexander and his work on a biography of Matthew Arnold. A
         letter of September 23, 1970 from Waller describes and
         discusses a trip to England, where he visited Fox How and
         other places with Arnold interests. Letters through the early
         1970s mention Mrs. Humphry (Mary) Ward, niece of Matthew
         Arnold, as the subject of a work-in-progress by William
         Peterson. On January 1, 1976, Waller mentions that Peterson
         has found a publisher for his book; and, on January 3, 1977,
         Whitridge comments on the book about Robert Elsmere and Mary
         Ward. Waller's growing interest in Alfred, Lord Tennyson comes
         to light in his letters of January 1, 1976 and July 19, 1980.
         He also expresses an interest in Irving Bacheller and comments
         on his writings in his letter of September 20, 1976. There is
         an interesting letter, March 8, 1976, from Whitridge, relating
         the courtship of his father and Lucy Arnold, Matthew Arnold's
         daughter.</p>
      <p>Accession #4885-br contains the original letters from
         Whitridge; these have replaced the electrostatic copies of the
         letters initially in #4885-bl. There are no restrictions on
         this correspondence.</p>
