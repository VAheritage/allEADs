      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection, 26 items, 1860-1907, consists of chiefly
         military and pension records concerning Captain John S. Eyster
         (ca. 1827-?) of Franklin County, Pennsylvania, Company K,
         "McClure's Rifles," 12th Regiment Pennsylvania Reserve Corps
         Volunteers (41st Pennsylvania Regiment). Also present are a
         few items concerning Private Christian S. Eyster (1853-?) of
         Alexander Hoore's Company F, 3rd U. S. Cavalry (postwar);
         Private James McConnell, Company C, 126th Pennsylvania
         Infantry; and Colonel Henry O. Kent, 17th New Hampshire
         Infantry Volunteers. Documents including muster rolls,
         military orders (mostly issued by Colonel John H. Taggart and
         Major Peter Baldy of the 12th Regiment), accounts, leave
         requests, and commissions. The collection also contains
         postwar materials concerning printed invitations, pensions and
         miscellaneous items.</p>
      <p>During Eyster's service (April 5, 1861 to August 23, 1862)
         the 12th Regiment was organized at Harrisonburg, Pennsylvania,
         and attached to the 3rd Brigade of McCall's Pennsylvania
         Reserves Division in the Army of the Potomac. It was on duty
         at Camp Curtin and Camp McCall (Pennsylvania) and Camp
         Tennally (Tennallytown, Maryland). The regiment participated
         in various campaigns in Virginia during 1861-62 including
         Dranesville (a January 10, 1862 letter describes Eyster as "a
         faithful and attentive officer" who played an active part in
         this engagement which occurred December 20, 1861) and the
         Seven Days. However, there are no other direct references to
         battle participation in this collection.¹</p>
      <p>Most items pertain to John Eyster's Civil War service as
         captain of Company K, "McClure's Rifles," 12th Regiment
         Pennsylvania Reserve Corps Volunteers (41st Pennsylvania
         Regiment) and members of his family. Among these are: Eyster's
         commission as a first lieutenant (May 7, 1861) signed by
         Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin (1817-1894); two muster
         rolls of the regiment (August 10, 1861); orders issued by
         Brigadier General George A. McCall (1802-1868) concerning camp
         sanitation and the reporting of any suspicious lights or
         signals (August 19 &amp; 24, 1861) and Special Orders No. 39,
         in which to curb sickness among the troops General McCall
         forbids sutlers and civilians to sell food or drink in the
         encampment (August 24, 1861); an American Tract Society
         publication 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Orders of Generals [George] Washington
         [August 3, 1776] and [George B.] McClellan [September 6,
         1861]</title>regarding respecting the Sabbath (September 6,
         1861); a September 1861 account of the pay, subsistence,
         forage and clothing of a servant, William H. Mong [an
         African-American?]; a detailed outline of the regiment's daily
         camp schedule (October 3, 1861); an August 20, 1862,
         invitation for officers of the Pennsylvania Reserve Corps to
         attend the presentation of a sword to Major General George G.
         Meade (1815-1872); and, a 1866, a printed invitation to
         veterans of Twelfth Regiment Pennsylvania Reserves to
         participate in a Fourth of July parade in Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, there are postwar comments on the reverse of
         some items. A January 31, 1862 account of Company K's savings
         by Eyster bears on its reverse "You can see how little they
         had to eat, to save the union and flag"; a leave of absence
         request, January 10, 1862, for Eyster endorsed by Brigadier
         General Edward O. C. Ord (1818-1883) bears a brief
         genealogical note: "Associate Judge from 1823 to 1832 Jacob
         Eyster/Father of John E./Mother Mary Slagel Eyster."</p>
      <p>Also of interest regarding the Eyster family is a ca. 1861
         photograph, by E. Woodward of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, of a
         young man [John S. Eyster?] in a militia uniform and leaning
         against a bayoneted rifle; a 1874 military discharge
         certificate, Fort McPherson, Nebraska, for Private Christian
         S. Eyster (b. 1853), Alexander Hoore's Company F, 3rd U. S.
         Cavalry and identifying him as a Chambersburg, Pennsylvania,
         farmer; a 1907 bounty claim form filed by Eyster's widow; and
         a December 17, 1907 letter from the solicitor for the
         directors of the poor in Chambersburg to C. W. Eyster,
         concerning a deed sent to Eyster's sister Fannie; on the
         reverse: "Leslie this was your Grandfather sword/And you are
         [entitled] to 360 acres of land through Uncle Christ."</p>
      <p>There are a few items apparently unrelated to the Eyster
         family including 1883 and 1887 pension records of James
         McConnell, Fort Worth, Texas, formerly a private in Company C,
         126th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, a 1860 love letter and
         poem to Miss Lide McConnell from an unidentified
         correspondent, and a 1892 U. S. Senate report on a private
         bill for Colonel Henry O. Kent, 17th New Hampshire Infantry
         Volunteers [later the 2nd New Hampshire Infantry], asking
         Congress to order the War Department officially to recognize
         his wartime rank of colonel.</p>
