      <p>Robert Jennings Harris, who served as Dean of Faculty of
         Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia (1963-68), was
         born in Tennessee on October 25, 1907. He took his academic
         education in the early 1930s at Vanderbilt University (A.B.,
         1930), the University of Illinois (A.M., 1931), and at
         Princeton (Ph.D., 1934). Harris taught political science at
         the University of Cincinnati for two years before settling at
         Louisiana State University in 1936 where he served for 18
         years as professor of government and as department chairman
         (1941-1954). Harris' subsequent appointment at Vanderbilt
         (1954), as professor of political science and then as
         department chairman (1962-63), covered a period of nine years
         and ended with his move to Charlottesville, Virginia in July,
         1963.</p>
      <p>Harris' academic activities and achievements were varied
         and widespread. He was visiting Professor at Vanderbilt and
         Columbia Universities and at the Universities of Minnesota and
         North Carolina. He was the Edward Douglas White lecturer at
         Louisiana State University in 1959, served as a special staff
         member of the Library of Congress, and, in 1968, was elected
         to be James Hart Professor of Government and Professor of
         History at the University of Virginia. Harris was vice
         president of the American Political Science Association, vice
         president and president of the Southern Political Science
         Association, and served as editor and later as member of the
         Board of Editors of the Journal of Politics.</p>
      <p>Harris retired from the University of Virginia in 1972.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This is a small collection (178 items, .2 shelf feet) of
         letters, reprints, newspaper clippings, and a framed
         photograph.</p>
      <p>Most of the collection is a correspondence of letters
         between Harris and Edward S. Corwin, under whom he studied
         while at Princeton. These letters contain an exchange of
         commentary on constitutional issues, political and world
         events, activites of colleagues and friends, and personal
         family matters.</p>
      <p>The letters exchanged with Hubert Horatio Humphrey are
         primarily congratulatory messages, acknowledgements of
         campaign support, reminiscences of past associations, and
         informal comments on political matters. They cover the periods
         during which Humphrey served as Mayor of Minneapolis, Senator
         from Minnesota, and Vice-President of the United States.</p>
      <p>The John F. Kennedy correspondence relates to Senate
         committee work and involves, in one instance, a solicitation
         of comments from Harris about presidential powers under the
         constitution and, in an another, a request to him to serve as
         a committee panel member to help nominate past U.S. Senators
         for "portrait enshrinement" in the Senate reception room.</p>
