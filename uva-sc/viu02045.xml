      <p>This addition to the papers of the Taylor family of
         Norfolk, Virginia, consists of ca. 2,850 items (12 Hollinger
         boxes, 4 linear shelf feet), 1846-1989, chiefly personal
         correspondence and related materials generated by the family
         while Dr. and Mrs. Taylor served as Episcopal medical
         missionaries in Anking, China, Anhui Province, on the Yangtze
         River, ca. 600 miles from the port of Shanghai, 1905-1951.</p>
      <p>Dr. Taylor's period of service as Director and
         Surgeon-in-Chief of the St. James Mission Hospital spanned
         many of the major historical changes in twentieth century
         China, including the Chinese revolt against the Manchu
         dynasty, the beginning of the Chinese Republic under Sun Yat
         Sen in 1911, the Nationalist Revolution led by Chiang
         Kai-Shek, during which Dr. Taylor was driven from the hospital
         by the Nationalist guerillas of the Kuomintang in 1927, the
         Sino-Japanese War beginning in 1937, the occupation of Anking
         by Japanese forces in 1938, and the triumph of the Chinese
         Communist Revolution in 1949.</p>
      <p>Dr. Harry Baylor Taylor, Sr. (1882-1971) attended medical
         school at the University of Virginia, 1898-1902, and married
         Alma Booth (1888- ?) in 1917. Two of the Taylor children also
         attended medical school at the University of Virginia, Helen
         Wickham Taylor (1919- ), graduate of 1943, and Harry B.
         Taylor, Jr. (1926- ), graduate of 1949. For information
         concerning the two earlier collections of Taylor family papers
         please consult the guides for # 9965, and # 9965-a.</p>
      <p>These papers include personal correspondence, notebooks and
         bound volumes, manuscripts and typescripts, informal talks,
         photographs and postcards, printed material, medical records,
         genealogical notes and charts, business and legal papers, and
         Chinese memorabilia (including paper money, stamps, government
         bonds, and visiting cards).</p>
      <p>The first series of papers consists of three boxes of
         correspondence. The folder of correspondence of W.H. Taylor
         and John C. Taylor (father of H.B. Taylor, Sr.), contains two
         topics of special note, the request to Purser John De Bree on
         the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">U.S.S. Ohio</title>to forward a letter
         to Lt. R.S. Page from Mrs. Page in Boston (1846 Dec 17) and a
         mention of the Franco-Prussian War and its effects upon the
         United States (1870 Sep 6).</p>
      <p>The remainder of the correspondence is from members of the
         Taylor family to each other or other individuals interested in
         their Chinese ministry. An early letter describes the
         Revolution of 1911, the election of a new provincial governor,
         the demand for a protection payment from the soldiers from
         Kiukiang, the assistance of Dr. Taylor to the Governor who
         escaped over the walls of the city during a time of civil
         unrest, the looting of Anking by soldiers and criminals, and
         the disunity of the Provincial Assembly (Republic of Anhui)
         (1911 Nov 19).</p>
      <p>John Gilliam, an employee of the British American Tobacco
         Company, wrote a long account of his trip to Anking and the
         wedding of Alma Booth and Harry B. Taylor, describing his
         impressions of Wuhu, Chinese junks, beggars, the Great Pagoda
         of Anking and other sights, and illustrating his letter with
         photographs of the St. James School, the Episcopal Cathedral,
         Anking scenes and the city wall, St. James Hospital, and the
         Great Pagoda (1917 Feb 7).</p>

         their hands off in the time of our quarrels, in other words,

         theirs." (1927 May 11); the evacuation of foreigners from

         Taylor's preference for the government of the Kuomintang
         (Nationalist Party) over the northern warlords, and a mention
         of the changes in new China (1929 Oct 21); the looting
         activities of the troops of Shih Yu-san, former adherent of
