      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection consists of the papers of the McCue family, ca. 1767-1944, ca.10,000 items
         including correspondence, legal and business papers, legal
         case notes, genealogical material, school notebooks and bound
         volumes, and Confederate Army commissary records. The
         collection pertains chiefly to the Reverend John McCue
         (1758-1818), of Augusta County, Virginia, and his descendants,
         including: his son, John McCue, his grandson, Judge John
         Howard McCue (1824-1890), lawyer of Lovingston, Nelson County,
         and of Staunton, Virginia, and Confederate officer of the
         "Floyd Brigade," Fifty-first Regiment, Virginia troops; and
         William T. McCue, lawyer and prominent Democrat, of Staunton,
         Virginia, son of John Howard McCue. The bulk of the collection
         concerns the family and career of Judge John Howard McCue. The
         Civil War records are the fairly complete files of
         quartermaster activity in the 51st Regiment, Virginia
         Volunteers, kept by John Howard McCue, including sales to
         officers, boards of survey, issues to the troops, invoices,
         abstracts, and the routes of campaign in Southwest Virginia.
         The 51st organized at Wytheville two months following the
         first battle of Bull Run, with men from Wythe, Wise, Grayson,
         Tazewell, Nelson, Amherst, Bland, and Patrick counties. While
         McCue was associated with the Regiment, it was involved
         chiefly in the Kanawha Valley and Fort Donelson region. The
         correspondence is largely concerned with the legal practice
         and the personal and business affairs of Judge John Howard
         McCue, but also includes other subjects of interest, which are
         listed on pages four through nine of this guide with the name
         of the correspondent and the date of the letter in which they
         occur.
