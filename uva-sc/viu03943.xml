      <head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Retired University of Virginia professor of music, <abbr expan="Milos Velimirovic">Miloš Velimirović</abbr> was born December 10, 1922, in Belgrade. He studied at the Belgrade Academy of Music and the University of Belgrade, where he earned a
diploma in the history of fine arts. He later earned an MA and PhD at Harvard and then served on the faculty at Yale, 1957-1969, then the University of Wisconsin until 1973 and finally the University of Virginia
until his retirement in 1993. A prolific writer of articles in scholarly journals, he also edited numerous other publications and wrote many reviews of books and recordings. Some of his seminal work has focused on
the relationship between Slavic and Greek chant melodies of the Slavonic heirmoi.
</p>
      <p>Albert J. Swan was a member of an English family who settled in Russia, where he was born on October 9, 1890, at St. Petersburg, where he also attended the St. Petersburg Conservatory. He left to study law,
languages and music at Oxford, England, emigrating to the United States in the 1920s. He taught first at the University of Virginia, and then jointly at Haverford and Swarthmore Colleges from 1926 until his
retirement in 1959. Swan was first recognized as a writer on music and as a musicologist interested in the relationship between Russian church chant and folk song. His work as a composer produced four piano
sonatas, six quartets, and much liturgical choral music, written mostly to old Slavonic texts for the Orthodox church, including a complete setting of the extensive Orthodox service, among others. He died on
October 2, 1970, in Haverford, Pennsylvania.
</p>
      <p>Pavel Chesnokov was born on November 5, 1877, in Voskresensk. His father was a music teacher and conductor, and his mother was a singer. He was enrolled in the Moscow Synodal Choir School as a child where he
remained as a faculty member after his graduation. He composed music for the services of the Orthodox Church and in 1913 enrolled in the Moscow Conservatory. Until his death in Moscow on March 14, 1944, he was
occupied primarily with the teaching of choral techniques and conducting.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The <abbr expan="Milos Velimirovic">Miloš Velimirović</abbr> papers consist of ca. 1400 items (3 Hollinger boxes, 1.5 linear feet), 1933-1990, donated by musicologist and scholar <abbr expan="Milos Velimirovic">Miloš Velimirović</abbr>, a specialist on medieval chants of the Eastern
Orthodox Churches and Eastern European music. The bulk of the papers consist of personal and professional correspondence. Personal correspondence includes letters to and from friends and acquaintances and holiday
greeting cards and newsletters. Correspondence is mainly in English but other languages include Russian, German, and French. Professional correspondence includes itineraries for travel to and reports on academic
conferences, letters of recommendations for employment, critiques and editing of scholarly and academic writings, draft manuscripts of journal articles, and copies of papers written by music specialists on a
variety of topics. There are also a number of papers related to Russian-born composer Alfred Swan, a colleague and friend of Velimirović. These include biographical and autobiographical materials, correspondence,
and materials related to a collection of Swan papers donated in the 1990s to the University of Virginia where Swan taught in the 1920s. Of interest are accounts of Swan's experiences in revolutionary Russia and
his ultimately successful effort to leave that war-torn country. Included in the Swan materials are papers related to Russian composer Pavel Chesnokov. Velimirović assembled the papers while preparing for
publication in the United States all of Chesnokov's available letters. They include copies of correspondence written in the 1930s by Chesnokov to Swan and one of his students, John Davison. There are also several
articles written by Swan on Russian church music, folk songs, and liturgical chant.
