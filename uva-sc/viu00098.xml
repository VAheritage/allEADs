      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>These papers of a prominent 
         Virginia figure consist of ca. 1400 items,
         1893-1940, and include correspondence, financial, legal, and
         military papers, photographs, and miscellaneous. The papers
         pertain chiefly to 
         Alfred Dickinson Barksdale (July 17, 1892
         -August 16, 1972) and his life, including his service in the 
         United States Army during World War I and
         his legal and political careers.</p>
      <p>
         Alfred Dickinson Barksdale was the son of 
         William Randolph Barksdale and Hallie Bailey (Craddock) Barksdale of 
         Halifax County, Virginia. He graduated from the 
         Virginia Military Institute in 1911 and
         received his Bachelor of Law from the 
         University of Virginia in 1915. He began
         his law practice in 
         Lynchburg in September of that year.
         During World War I, he served with distinction in the 
         United States Army. On July 15, 1917, he
         was appointed first lieutenant, Headquarter Company, 116th
         Infantry, 29th Division, of the 
         American Expeditionary Forces, and was
         sent overseas on May 26, 1918. He was promoted to captain on
         July 4, 1918, and assigned to command Company M. of the same
         regiment. For his participation in a defensive sector and in
         the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, he received a citation and was
         awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by his country and the
         Croix de Guerre and the Chevalier de Legion d'Honeur by 
         France. After the war he returned to 
         Lynchburg and resumed his law practice. He
         was elected to the 
         Virginia State Senate from his district,
         serving 1924-1928. In July 1938 he was appointed by the
         governor as Judge of the 
         Sixth Judicial Court of Virginia, and in
         1940 he was appointed Judge of the 
         United States District Court, Western District of
         Virginia, which he served until his death. In
         addition, he was a Trustee of 
         Hollins College, on the 
         Board of Visitors at the University of
         Virginia, and a member of 
         Lynchburg bar associations. He and 
         Estill Winfree (February 19,1905-) were
         married on December 15, 1934, and had two daughters, 
         Louisa Estill Winfree Barksdale (May 26,
         1936-) and 
         Mary Owen Barksdale (July 11, 1937-).</p>
      <p>
         William Randolph Barksdale, the son of 
         Elisha Barksdale and 
         Judith Armistead (Barksdale) Barksdale,
         was born on January 6, 1849 in 
         Halifax County and died April 5, 1925.
         After assisting the 
         Virginia Militia during the Civil War, he
         attended the 
         University of Virginia, receiving his
         M.A. in 1870. He was admitted to the bar and was elected Judge
         of 
         Halifax County, serving from 1874 to
         1880, and again from 1886 to 1904. In 1904 he was elected
         Judge of the Sixth Judicial District of 
         Virginia, which he held until his death.
         He and his first wife, 
         Hallie Bailey Craddock (July 26,
         1854-April 23, 1900), were married on November 14, 1872 at 
         Halifax, Virginia. They had nine
         children: 
         William Randolph Barksdale (February 11,
         1874-); 
         Fanny Poindexter Barksdale (May 16,
         1876-); 
         Charles Craddock Barksdale (November 6,
         1878-); 
         Elisha Barksdale (March 18, 1881-); 
         Louise Jasper Barksdale (December 4,
         1883-); 
         Helen Barksdale (January 31, 1887-); 
         Mary Owen Barksdale (July 15, 1889-); 
         Alfred Dickinson Barksdale (July 17,
         1892-August 16, 1972); and 
         John Craddock Barksdale (June 26, 1896-). 
         William Randolph Barksdale married 
         Virginia Douglas Watson (April 4,
         1863-December 9, 1937) on June 28, 1905, at 
         South Boston, Virginia.</p>
      <p>Letters, 1917-1921, from 
         William Randolph Barksdale, 
         Houston, Virginia, to his son, 
         Alfred Dickinson Barksdale while in 
         Paris, France, with the 
         American Expeditionary Forces, include
         news and thoughts of the war, local news and politics,
         mentions of 
         Halifax County court cases, and word of
         family and friends. Throughout his letters, 
         William Randolph Barksdale refers to the
         war, expresses his pride in his son, and includes letters from
         another son, 
         John Craddock Barksdale. A September 30,
         1918 letter from 
         John Craddock Barksdale (enclosed with an
         October 3, 1918 letter) describes the Liberty Loan parade. A
         November 14, 1918 letter mentions 
         John Craddock Barksdale being gassed and
         working on a farm in 
         France while recovering. In his letter of
         March 26, 1919, 
         John Craddock Barksdale encloses letters
         from 
         Charles J. Faulkner, Jr., 
         Charles C. Barksdale, 
         Volney Erskine Howard, 
         Elizabeth Sydnor Boland, and 
         Avis Walker Carrington about 
         Alfred Dickinson Barksdale 's citation. 
         William Barksdale was interested in
         politics and often referred to various aspects such as 
         Woodrow Wilson 's administration and the
         Republican control of the 
         House of Representatives (November 7,
         1918); the appointment of 
         Carter Glass as Secretary of the Treasury
         (December 11, 1918); 
         Carter Glass and 
         Virginia State Congress (January 2 &amp;
         20, 1919); 
         Dick Booker 's political scheme (March 4,
         1919); and, a speech by Glass (April 19, 1919). Letters of
         October 25, November 14, and December 3, 1918 are concerned
         with the death of his son-in-law, 
         Henry Maury Vaughan, and the resulting
         situation of his wife, 
         Fanny Poindexter (Barksdale), and their
         children. Included with 
         William Barksdale 's letter of November
         14, are letters from his sons, 
         John Craddock Barksdale and 
         Charles Craddock Barksdale, offering
         assistance for 
         Fanny Pointdexter Barksdale. Other items
         of passing interest include mention of: the wounding of 
         Murrell Alexander in action (October 25,
         1918); a horse-trading case (February 20, 1919); hearing Dr. 
         Claudius Smith of 
         Lynchburg at 
         Rustburg Episcopal Church and the death of
         Taylor Ellison (March 20, 1919); the death
         of their clerk, 
         Gran Craddock (March 26, 1919); the death
         of 
         Tucker Watkins (April 4, 1919); the
         Victory Liberty Loan Campaign (April 19, 1919); a drowning
         incident involving a boy, 
         William Johnson (June 3, 1919); and, Col. 
         [Aubrey] Strode, a visit to the 
         University of Virginia and 
         Monticello, and hearing speeches of Judge
         [Richard Thomas Walker] Duke, Jr. and 
         [Calvin] Coolidge (June 30, 1921).</p>
      <p>Letters, 1919-1920, from 
         Irene Le Ckazal describe some of the
         conditions in 
         France. In her letter of September 13,
         1919, she refers to the strike of dockers and other workers
         causing a delay in obtaining a boat for their safe passage to 
         Ile Maurice, Mauritius. On May 13, 1920,
         she writes that her family is preparing to leave for their
         sugar estate, " 
         Saint Antoine, " on 
         Ile Maurice, Mauritius in the 
         Indian Ocean. After their arrival, she
         writes on November 9, 1920, describing life at " 
         Saint Antoine " and a tennis
         championship.</p>
      <p>Letters, 1920-1926, from 
         Betty Oldfield reveal the personal and
         professional life of a young actress and mention "doing moving
         picture work" (April 1, 1920); joining the 
         `Little Whopper' Company (April 19, 1920);
         the attendance by 
         Woodrow Wilson on a certain night
         (February 8, 1921); divorce proceedings (April 17, June 7,
         1921; January 22, 1922; June 4, 1925; and May 3, 1926); her
         "Grandfather Webb" reluctantly defending 
         Charles J. Guiteau, the assassin of 
         James A. Garfield, and his being a friend
         of 
         Grover Cleveland (January 22, 1922); and,
         feelings toward married women and divorced women (September
         15, n.y.).</p>
      <p>Letters, 1918-1925, from 
         Katharine Vallandigham represent the life
         of an intelligent young woman pursuing a medical career. The
         first letter, January 3, 1918, apparently represents the
         beginning of their correspondence, as it includes personal
         information and seeks certain knowledge about the recipient.
         In the postscript she also mentions that her father's uncle, 
         Clement J. Vallandigham, was a famous
         copperhead. During the fall of 1918 through the spring of
         1919, 
         Katharine Vallandigham was a student at 
         Vassar College in 
         Poughkeepsie, New York. Her letters
         during this period mention 
         Germany 's near-collapse, the influenza
         epidemic and innoculations, and one of her roommates with
         nurses' training going to 
         New York City as a volunteer nurse
         (October 21, 1918); wanting to meet American troops arriving
         in the 
         United States on the Cretic (January 24,
         1919); 
         Alfred Dickinson Barksdale taking a course
         at the University in 
         France or at 
         Oxford and 
         Cambridge, and her travels to 
         Europe (March 11, 1919); plans to go to 
         Crawford Camp at 
         Paul Smith 's after graduation (April 15,
         1919); and, 
         Alfred Dickinson Barksdale 's homecoming
         (May 31, 1919). On October 27, 1919, she writes a thoughtful
         letter from 
         Auburn, New York, concerning wounded
         privates from 
         Green Hill Hospital, fourteen soldiers
         living at the `Beach House,' and her feelings about the war
         and the disabled veterans. On March 14, 1920, she mentions her
         disappointment in 
         Virginia not ratifying the suffrage
         amendment. Letters, 1922-1923, concern 
         Katharine Vallandigham 's medical studies
         and touch upon various aspects: her interest in anatomy and a
         dissection in the region of the hip (October 9, 1922); the
         theory of Dr. [ ] Stockard about the correlation between
         anatomy and how the mind works, depression and her heart not
         being in medicine (October 17, 1922); her decision to commit
         to medicine, being a member of the medical students branch of
         the 
         Young Men's Christian Association, and a
         dissecting project (October 21, 1922); a lecture in the
         ampitheatre in 
         Bellevue Hospital for a class in surgery
         at
