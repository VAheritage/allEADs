      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Orland Emile White was born in Sibley, Iowa in 1885 and
         grew up on a farm in South Dakota. He attended South Dakota
         State College, where he received a B.S. degree in 1909 and an
         M.S. degree in 1911, and Harvard University, where he received
         an M. A. degree in Genetics in 1912, and a Sc.D. degree in
         1913. While conducting research for several government
         agencies, White became the Assistant Curator of Plant Breeding
         for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden in 1913; he was appointed
         Curator in 1916. Though he held this post until 1927 he
         obtained a leave of absence in 1921-1922 to act as botanist
         for the expedition of the Mulford Biological Exploration of
         the Amazon Basin. In 1927 he became Professor of Genetics and
         Economic Plants in the Miller School of biology, University of
         Virginia, and Director of the Blandy Experimental Farm; he
         held these positions until his formal retirement in 1955. In
         1956, however, he abandoned retirement to become Visiting
         Professor of Biology at Sweetbriar College. Although he
         published extensively in scientific journals and was
         considered to be an eminent geneticist of his day, he was also
         active in nonprofessional gardening societies and
         organizations. Perhaps most important, however, is the fact
         that he was revered by his students as a devoted and
         charismatic teacher.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The O. E. White papers consist of ca. 3300 items,
         1903-1968, concerning all aspects of White's life as a
         student, scientist, teacher, explorer, and husband. His
         correspondence extends from his earliest days as a college
         student through retirement, and pertains both to his private

         lists; there are also copies of his detailed journal of the
