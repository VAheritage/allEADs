         summer of 1962 and scholar-in-residence during 1967-1968 at
         the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies. The letters and
         other items were sent to his friend and fellow poet, Felix
         Pollak (1909- ). Pollak, born in Vienna, Austria, came to
         America as a refugee prior to World War II. He was curator of
         rare books at Northwestern University from 1949-1959 and at
         the University of Wisconsin--Madison from 1959-1974.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>There are thirteen items, correspondence and printed
         material, 1962-1967, relating to American poet Jonathan
         Williams (1929- ).</p>
      <p>Topics discussed in the letters include various literary
         matters such as works in progress, reading tours, The Jargon
         Society, The Nantahala Foundatioin, the publishing business,
         and several poets and authors. During 1962, Williams refers to
         a project on Mina Loy (1882-1966), and mentions S[amuel]
         F[rench] Morse (1916-1969), T[imothy] Reynolds (1936- ), and
         Jackson [Robert] Bryer (1937- ) in relation to the project.
         Also, in late 1962, he mentions Dave Haselwood and Auerhan
         [Press]. A printed letter, January 1, 1963, concern's
         "Jargon's extreme discouragement with readers, writers,
         foundations, poetry societies, those able to be patrons and
         subscribers, et al.," explaining the importance of Jargon in
         introducing the avant-garde to the public, and requesting
         contributions to keep it in business. On November 2 and 14,
         1964, Williams writes while on a reading trip, mentioning
         Ronald Johnson (1935- ), Edward Kamarck, Jackson Bryer, Lorine
         Niedecker (1903-1970), and plans to be with them in Milwaukee,
         Wisconsin on the 20th; and, writes the "Vachel-Lindsay VW
         Special still on schedule." On November 18, 1966, he mentions
         Paul Goodman (1911-1972), his appointment at the Aspen
         Institute as writer-in-residence for 18 months beginning in
         April, and a reading tour scheduled for February and March and
         asking for a date at Madison. Letters on April 28, May 4 and
         12, 1967, are from the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies.
         The April 28 letter is headed "Invitation to a Festschrift in
         Honor of Edward Dahlberg's Achievement at his 67th Birthday,
         July 22, 1967," and requests a form of writing in honor of
         Dahlberg (1900-1977) and lists the invited participants. The
         May 4 letter (copy) to 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The New York Times</title>and its
         response concern an article about the Russian poet, Andrei
         Voznesensky (1933- ). The May 12 letter refers to a quote from
         Geoffrey Grigson (1905- ) about poems men write, a request
         from Tony Godwin, editor of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Penquin</title>, for an anthology, and
         Guy Davenport. On May 15, 1967, Williams mentions Ronald
         [Johnson], and reveals that he is busy with the Dahlberg and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Penquin</title>projects.</p>
