      <p>Anne Bethel Spencer was born an only child in Henry County, Virginia, on February 6,
                1882, to Joel Cephus Bannister (1862-?) of Henry County, Virginia, and Sarah Louise
                Scales (1866-?) of Patrick County, Virginia. Sometime around 1883, the family moved
                to Martinsville, Virginia, where Joel opened a saloon. Sarah had relatives in
                Bramwell, West Virginia, and she moved there in either 1887 or 1888 to work in the
                Blue Stone Inn. Soon Anne was able to join her mother in Bramwell, where she lived
                with the family of the local barber, William T. Dixie and his wife, Willie Belle. In
                September 1893, Annie moved to Lynchburg, Virginia, at the age of eleven in order to
                attend Virginia Seminary for her education. She was registered there as Annie Bethel
                Scales in September 1893.</p>
      <p>Anne Spencer graduated on May 8, 1899, and gave the valedictory speech during the
                ceremony held at Diamond Hill Baptist Church, Lynchburg. Following graduation Annie
                began teaching second grade in West Virginia, near Bramwell. She and Edward A.
                Spencer (1876-1964) were married on May 15, [1901] by the Reverend Frank
                Marshall in Bramwell, West Virginia, at the home of her friends, William T. and
                Willie Belle Dixie, and set up housekeeping in Lynchburg, Virginia. They had three
                children, Bethel Calloway, Alroy Sarah, and Chauncey Edward Spencer, and a fourth
                child who died shortly after birth with diphtheria.</p>
      <p>Working with NAACP secretary James Weldon Johnson, she helped co-found the Lynchburg
                chapter of the NAACP in 1918. It was also Johnson who discovered her poetry and was
                instrumental in getting her first published poem, "Before the Feast of Shushan" to
                the public. It was published in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Crisis</title> in
                February 1920. The poetry of Anne Spencer can be found in some of the period's most
                prestigious anthologies, including <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Book of American Negro
                    Poetry</title> (James Weldon Johnson); <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Negro Poets and
                    Their Poems</title> (Robert T. Kelin); <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">American Poetry
                    Since 1900</title> (Louis Untermeyer); <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The New
                    Negro</title> (Alain Locke); <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Caroling Dusk</title>
                (Countee Cullen); and <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Poetry of the Negro,
                    1746-1949</title> (Langston Hughes and Arna Bontemps). Spencer is
                recognized as a part of the Harlem Renaissance literary movement not only because of
                her published poetry but her friendships with many of the other African-American
                writers of the time.</p>
      <p>Anne Spencer became the librarian at the Dunbar High School in Lynchburg and worked
                there from about 1924 until 1946. She lived most of her adult life in Lynchburg,
                Virginia, chiefly at 1313 Pierce Street, where she hosted many literary and civil
                rights figures in her home during their visits to her area. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>

                some of her poems by Greene, and articles possibly written for a column in the

                Newark," "Chattel slavery or why I dislike Booker T," "Comments about herself spoken
                to Ben W. Fuson," "Dear children," "In the thicket" [regarding a short story by

                unfinished poems she constantly revised particularly "Big Ditch and the River," "A
                Dream of John Brown: on his return trip home."</p>

      <p>Correspondence of Anne Spencer is chiefly with and about family, friends, fellow
                poets and anthologizers. Of interest are letters from Sterling A. Brown, Countee
                Cullen, Victor Daly, Arthur P. Davis, W.E.B. du Bois, Helen G. Edmonds, Murrell
                Edmunds, Ben Fuson, J. Lee Greene, Langston Hughes, Altona Trent Johns, Georgia

                LeRoy Locke, Harry Meacham, H. L. Mencken (copy), Amaza Meredith, Clarence Muse,
                Francis Coleman Rosenberger, Frank Silvera, Idella Purnell [Stone], Howard Thurman,
                and Carl Van Vechten, concerning her poetry and their own work. There are also

                Powell, Claude McKay, and William Raspberry, Jim Crow laws and segregation, and the
                Spencer family. There are many brief comments on people in the news and current
                events including the Democratic Presidential Convention of 1948 and the Republican
                Convention of 1952.</p>

      <p>Financial and legal papers chiefly concern the Lynchburg, Virginia, property
                management business, tax business and chicken business of Edward Spencer. Many of
                his business ledgers were later reused by his widow for jotting down her poetry
                ideas. Also present is an 1829 New Hampshire deed, an 1863 will, and the wills of
                Anne and her husband.</p>

                African American and historic broadsides; invitations; clippings; programs; a few
                papers concerning Chauncey Spencer, a Tuskeegee Airman, including a blueprint for a
                hangar at Dothan, Ala.; mimeograph copies of poetry by Gerald William Barrax; and a
                rough draft of "Searching for Anne Spencer" by Pat Doyle.</p>

    <arrangement>
      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The papers of Anne Spencer arrived with almost no discernible order. The current
                order was imposed by the processor. The papers are arranged in five series: Series
                I: Correspondence (Boxes 1-6); Series II: Photographs (Boxes 7-9); Series III:
                Financial and Legal Papers and Volumes (Boxes 9-13); Series IV: Topical Files (Boxes
                13-17); and Series V: Manuscripts, both individual and in notebooks (Boxes
                17-22).</p>
      <p>Series V is also subdivided into several subseries: Subseries A: Manuscripts with a
                title; Subseries B: Manuscripts arranged by beginning line; Subseries C: Topical
                Manuscripts with no titles, arranged by subject; Subseries D: Dated Notebooks;
                Subseries E: Undated Notebooks; and Subseries F: Poems and Other.</p>
      <p>Correspondence is summarized at the folder level, and while all identified
                correspondents are listed, not all letters are described individually. When
                possible, negatives have been placed in the same folder with their photographs.</p>
      <p>Poems and manuscripts with titles have their own folder and are listed separately.
                Other manuscripts are arranged by the apparent topic when it can be determined. Some
                designations of topics by the processor are very subjective and often several
                different topics can be found within a single manuscript. Dated notebooks are
                described first, followed by the undated notebooks. Undated notebooks have been
                assigned an alphabet designation to keep them distinct in the guide.</p>

                                Missouri, between 1927 and 1929, which mentions his plans to enter

                                1923); apologizes for not telegraphing due to the lateness of the
                                train, etc. and tells Spencer that Dubois and Alice Dunbar, who
                                referred to her as "Anne of the wonderful lines" really wished to
                                meet her (December 12, 1927); always wishes she were closer
                                geographically, "I do not separate you from your garden, your
                                elegant verse and your sure philosophy" (February 24, 1951); and

                                Weldon Johnson and Grace Johnson Most of this correspondence is from
                                Grace Johnson. The majority of the Johnson-Spencer correspondence is
                                in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University.
                                Johnson encloses a letter from H.L. Mencken about Anne Spencer's
                                verses, which he asks to be returned (April 3, 1919, copy only);
                                draft of letter to Johnson from Spencer, asks if he has read
                                Mencken's latest in the February <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Smart

                                writing, "It's going to be a pity if you ever begin thinking that
                                being a Secretary is quite so utilitarian as being a Poet. I would
                                rather have written say, your 'Lottery Girl' or 'Fifty Years' than
                                to have written your Hayti articles, as thoro as they are." (March
                                2, 1921); a draft from Spencer thanks Johnson for his autographed
                                photograph, looks forward to his visit, discusses a Detroit meeting
                                about Civil Rights, and includes notes to herself about the evils of
                                Jim Crow laws and the damage they do to the Negro soul [April
                                1921?]; another draft from Spencer discusses the Johnson-Dyer
                                anti-lynching bill, "A natural rider to include in the measure would
                                abolish Jim Crow cars. They are my black beast. Lynching the body is
                                as final as it is undesirable, but the Jim Crow car lynches ones
                                soul over and over again." She also writes about her poetry, "I have
                                nothing new finished. But there are 'leventy-leven bits stuck in as
                                many different places that promise something if I ever get at them."

                                welfare of her husband, Anne promises to "take my talents as
                                seriously as a movie-star - or a Baptist preacher." James Johnson
                                sends condolences to Edward on the death of his mother (April 2,
