         <p>
            <persname>Louisa H.A. Minor</persname>, born April 13, 1833,
         was the youngest child of 
         <persname>Samuel Overton Minor</persname>( -August 30, 1838)
         and 
         <persname>Lydia Laurie (Lewis) Minor</persname>(February 15,
         1795-August 8, 1833). After her parents' deaths, 
         <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>was raised by her mother's
         sister, 
         <persname>Mary Walker (Lewis) Leitch Anderson</persname>(March
         25, 1793-June 21, 1872) of "Pant-Ops," 
         <geogname>Albemarle County</geogname>. Throughout the diary, 
         <persname>Mary Walker Anderson</persname>and 
         <persname>David Anderson</persname>are referred to as "Ma" and
         "Daddy."</p>
         <p>
            <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>'s diary, ca. 350 pages, kept
         from September 1, 1855 to December 29, 1866, reveals her
         personal feelings as well as both routine and extraordinary
         events in the lives of herself and her family and friends. She
         often writes about her weekly activities, especially church
         attendance and social interactions with relatives and friends.
         References to her family and friends often concern marriages,
         births, illnesses, deaths, visits, and 
         <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>'s impressions about
         individuals and the events in their lives. She also writes her
         own poetry, quotes verses of others, and records her thoughts
         on books she read and church sermons she heard.</p>
         <p>There are frequent references to members of the 
         <famname>Minor family</famname>, especially 
         <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>'s brothers and sisters and
         their families. While 
         <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>was still a small child, her
         father and several offspring migrated to 
         <geogname>Missouri</geogname>, while others, including 
         <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>, remained in 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>. During the period of the diary,
         the following siblings were living: 
         <persname>Mary Overton Minor</persname>(December 4, 1812-), 
         <persname>Garritt Minor</persname>(November 15, 1815-), 
         <persname>William Woolfolk Minor</persname>(March 10, 1817-May
         3, 1885), 
         <persname>James Hunter Minor</persname>(November 15,
         1818-April 12, 1862), 
         <persname>Samuel Overton Minor</persname>(May 12, 1820-March
         24, 1880), 
         <persname>Nicholas Peter Minor</persname>(August 25, 1822-), 
         <persname>Bettie Lewis Minor</persname>(September 12, 1825-),
         and 
         <persname>Sallie Watson Minor</persname>(January 3, 1829-March
         1873). There are also references to more distant relatives as
         well as friends of the 
         <famname>Anderson family</famname>, 
         <famname>Carr family</famname>, 
         <famname>Davis family</famname>, 
         <famname>Gilmer family</famname>, 
         <famname>Leitch family</famname>, 
         <famname>Lewis family</famname>, 
         <famname>Macmurdo family</famname>, 
         <famname>Meriwether family</famname>, 
         <famname>Minor family</famname>, 
         <famname>Randolph family</famname>and 
         <famname>Terrell family</famname>.</p>
         <p>
            <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>was quite religious, often
         attending church several times a week, and visiting churches
         of different denominations, including 
         <corpname>Grace Church</corpname>, the " 
         <corpname>Brick Church</corpname>, " 
         <corpname>the University "Chapel"</corpname>(held at this time
         in a room in the wing of the 
         <corpname>Rotunda</corpname>), 
         <corpname>St. Paul's Church</corpname>, 
         <corpname>the "Monumental" Church</corpname>, and an 
         <corpname>"African" Church</corpname>in 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>. She heard some of the prominent
         clergymen of the time such as 
         <persname>Ebenezer Boyden</persname>, 
         <persname>John Albert Broadus</persname>, 
         <persname>Dabney Carr Davis</persname>, 
         <persname>Richard Terrell Davis</persname>, 
         <persname>Richard Kidder Meade</persname>, 
         <persname>Bishop William Meade</persname>, Liberian Bishop 
         <persname>John S. Payne</persname>, and 
         <persname>Joseph Pere Bell Wilmer</persname>.</p>
         <p>There are references to and some descriptions of places
         visited and events attended, including the 
         <corpname>Virginia State Fair</corpname>in 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>in 1857 and again in 1860. 
         <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>often visited the nearby
         estates of family and friends-- 
         <famname>Castalia</famname>, 
         <famname>Cloverfields</famname>, 
         <famname>Kinloch</famname>, 
         <corpname>Locust Hill</corpname>, 
         <corpname>Music Hall</corpname>, 
         <corpname>Orange Dale</corpname>--relating occurrences at
         them. There are mentions of the funeral of the artist 
         <persname>John Toole</persname>(March 1860), the annual
         celebrations of the 
         <corpname>Jefferson Society</corpname>and the 
         <corpname>Washington [Literary] Society</corpname>at the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>as well as other
         events at the University. Information on 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>is found throughout the
         diary.</p>
         <p>Prior to the beginning of the Civil War references to
         blacks included news of freed servants sailing from 
         <geogname>Norfolk</geogname>to 
         <geogname>Africa</geogname>(December 1856), and later accounts
         of many of their deaths while en route (April 1857). Also
         during this time there was much political discussion and talk
         of insurrections generally (December 1856) and of
         insubordination among the servants at 
         <corpname>Music Hall</corpname>(August 1857). 
         <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>'s feelings toward the
         uprisings was probably indicative of the way the Southerners
         felt during this time. She often referred to the closeness of
         the family and the servants, and seemed to have no
         understanding of any rebelliousness. This lack of
         understanding seems evident in December 1865 when she wrote
         that the "freedmen seem to be having all the fun and goodies."
         She wrote of their changing status, their unwillingness to
         attend to the family's wants, and their still receiving daily
         allowances--all with the belief that they had been treated
         fairly (December 1865).</p>
         <p>During the Civil War, 
         <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>wrote about occurrences in
         more detail, although much of the news was indirect, through
         hearsay or letters. In late 1860, 
         <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>wrote about the realization
         of war, and the companies of infantry "drawn out in all `the
         pomp and circumstance of war'." Throughout the war she often
         expressed the typical feelings of Southerners toward the
         Northerners, the victories and losses of the 
         <corpname>Confederate Army</corpname>, heroes such as 
         <persname>"Stonewall" Jackson</persname>, destruction of land
         and transportation modes, and the changing status of blacks.
         From January 1861 through April 1865, 
         <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>reported on the progress of
         the war. She mentions that when 
         <persname>Stonewall Jackson</persname>'s troops marched
         through in June 1862, she spent the whole day feeding
         soldiers, gave up her bed at night, and was paid a visit in
         the parlor by General 
         <persname>Richard Ewell</persname>, "a funny old
         fellow...[with] the simplicity and heart of a child...". She
         also reports on a Christmas dinner given to over 1200 soldiers
         at the 
         <corpname>Delevan Hospital</corpname>, 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>, and Custer's
         diversionary raid on Rio Hill on February 29, 1864. As time
         progressed, the effects of the war became personally evident
         to 
         <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>as more and more of her
         family and friends and the surrounding area were affected.
         During late 1864,and early 1865, 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>was more involved in the
         war, with Yankee raids and destruction of property. 
         <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>gives a fairly full account
         of Federal troops passing through 
         <geogname>Albemarle County</geogname>in March 1865, and
         describes the hardships of the first year of
         Reconstruction.</p>
         <p>Also included is a bequest, April 23, 1871, of 
         <persname>Mary Walker (Lewis) Anderson</persname>leaving her
         table furniture, two feather beds and a trundle bed with bed
         clothes, "wearing clothes," tin ware, and all personal
         property and money due her to 
         <persname>Louisa Minor</persname>.</p>
