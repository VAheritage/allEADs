      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Norborne Berkeley was born in Danville, Virginia on 13 May
         1891. After graduating from Episcopal High School in
         Alexandria, Virginia, he entered law school at George
         Washington Law School in Washington, D.C. After his first
         year, he transferred to the Law School of the University of
         Virginia, from which he graduated in 1916. While at the
         University, Berkeley played football and was a member of Delta
         Kappa Epsilon and the Eli Banana Society. Berkeley was
         admitted to the Virginia Bar in 1916, but went to New York to
         join the firm of Cravath and Henderson.</p>
      <p>When the United States entered World War I, he left New
         York to become a captain in the Field Artillery of the United
         States Army. While in France he graduated from the General
         Staff College and attended Oxford University and Inns of
         Court. Shortly before his discharge in 1919, Berkeley was made
         a major. Just before leaving for his tour of duty overseas in
         May 1918, he married Dorothea Winslow Randolph.</p>
      <p>Upon his discharge, Berkeley joined the legal department of
         Bethlehem Steel Company. In 1922 he was promoted to Assistant
         Secretary, in 1930 Assistant to the President, and in 1935 he
         assumed directorship of the holding company, Bethlehem Steel
         Corporation. He became vice-president in 1845 and retained the
         title until his retirement in December 1962.</p>
      <p>Although he lived in Pennsylvania during most of his adult
         life, Berkeley donated both time and money to several Virginia
         schools. He served as a Trustee to Episcopal High School and
         donated a dormitory that bears his name, the organ in the
         chapel, and other undesignated funds. In honor of his ancestor
         Norborne Berkeley, Lord Botetourt, a Royal Governor of
         Virginia, he revived and endowed an award given at the College
         of William and Mary. To the University of Virginia Berkeley
         gave funds for athletics and the law school, as well as his
         time when he was appointed to the Board of Visitors in 1955.
         He served until the end of his term in 1963.</p>
      <p>Berkeley is survived by a daughter Dorothea Berkeley Brush
         and a son Norborne, Jr.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers, 1918-1964, of Norborne Berkeley consist of
         about 47,000 items or forty-seven shelf feet of personal,
         legal, business, and financial papers of his career as an
         executive with Bethlehem Steel Company. These include family
         and business correspondence, business papers, and personal
         investment, financial, and legal papers.</p>
      <p>The largest group in the papers is the correspondence.
         Although Bethlehem Steel Company retained all correspondence
         that dealt strictly with the day to day business, there is a
         mixing of business and family material in the files. There is
         also a great deal of family correspondence since Berkeley
         apparently preferred to dictate all letters. The files include
         letters and carbons of replies. In the rare instances where he
         wrote a letter by hand, there is generally a copy. Among the
         more interesting letters are those written by Berkeley to his
         wife during his tour of duty overseas.</p>
      <p>Another large portion deals with Berkeley's private
         investments and finances. These include reports on oil and gas
         drilling in Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Colorado
         and the sales of the raw material. Among the financial papers
         are check stubs, stock investment reports, trust reports and
         income tax returns. The rest of the collection includes
         material intended to be placed in scrapbooks, papers
         pertaining to the University of Virginia Board of Visitors,
         and photographs. Papers pertaining to Berkeley's affiliation
         with Episcopal High School have been sent to that school.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement>
      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The papers have, in general, been kept in the original
         order and groups in which they were received. Therefore much
         of the correspondence will be found in reverse order, i.e.
         December 31- January 1 rather than the usual January 1-
         December 31 arrangement. Whenever possible, the original
         labelling, chronology, and divisions have been retained. The
         papers are arranged in chronological order by year and in
         alphabetical order within the year, with the exception of Oil
         and Gas Investments. This group is arranged chronologically
         under the name of the drilling operations.</p>
      <p>The collection is divided into five series with
         sub-headings when necessary. They are: Series I: General
         Correspondence, Boxes 1-78 Series II: Papers of the Board of
         Visitors of the University of Virginia, Boxes 79-87 Series
         III: Business Papers a. Bethlehem Steel Company, Boxes 88-90
         b. Oil and Gas Investments, Boxes 91-105 Series IV: Financial
         Papers a. Personal Accounts and Papers, Boxes 106-109 b.
         Checkbooks from Morgan, Guaranty, and Trust of New York, Box
         110 c. Checkbooks from First National Bank of Bethlehem,
         Pennsylvania, Boxes 111-113 Series V: Miscellaneous a.
         Scrapbook Material, Boxes 114-116 b. Photographs - Storage
