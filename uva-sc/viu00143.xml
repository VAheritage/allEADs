         <famname>Elliot</famname>Family papers contain ca. 15,000
         items (41 Hollinger boxes, ca. 17 linear feet and four
         oversize folders), ca. 1773-1992, and consist largely of

         <famname>Cocke</famname>, 
         <famname>Elliot</famname>, and related families from the
         colonial period through the twentieth century, assembled by 
         <persname>John Page Elliot</persname>.</p>
      <p>The correspondence consists chiefly of the letters of

         descendants of General 
         <persname>John Hartwell Cocke</persname>. The collection also

         <famname>Cocke</famname>and 
         <famname>Elliot</famname>families.</p>
      <p>Early letters of interest include many during the courtship
         and marriage of 
         <persname>John Bowdoin Cocke</persname>and 
         <persname>Bettie Burwell Page</persname>(1860s-1870s); 
         <persname>Bettie Burwell Page</persname>offering her services
         and those of a Miss Taylor to the Confederate Secretary of the
         Treasury (1862 Oct 3); a letter to 
         <persname>Bettie Burwell Page</persname>concerning her

      <p>The letters of 
         <persname>Lucy Hamilton (Cocke) Elliot</persname>consist of
         correspondence with family and friends, and contain a series
         of courtship letters written from about 1890 through 1906 by
         several 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>students, including

         Several letters written between March and August of 1903
         describe a tour of 
         <geogname>Europe</geogname>and the 
         <geogname>Mediterranean</geogname>made by

         <geogname>Pompeii</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Athens</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Constantinople</geogname>,

         <geogname>Paris</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>London</geogname>.</p>
      <p>Also included are letters from 
         <persname>Robert L. Parrish</persname>which describe his
         travels in July and August of 1905 to the 
         <geogname>Grand Canyon</geogname>,

         <geogname>Canada</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Alaska</geogname>. The majority of letters circa
         1902 -1928 are written by 
         <persname>Milton Courtwright Elliot</persname>who married 
         <persname>Lucy Cocke</persname>in 1906. The correspondence
         contains letters written to and from Lucy and Milton Elliot's
         two sons, 
         <persname>Warren Grice Elliot</persname>and 
         <persname>John Page Elliot</persname>, as well as letters of
         sympathy received on the death of 
         <persname>Milton Elliot</persname>in 1928. The later letters
         of 
         <persname>Lucy Cocke Elliot</persname>are mainly to and from
         members of the 
         <famname>Cocke family</famname>, especially her sister

         continued correspondence with 
         <persname>Hermann Holst Swift</persname>.</p>
      <p>The letters of 
         <persname>Betty Page Cocke</persname>are considerably more
         extensive and pertain to her involvement in politics and
         historic preservation while also containing letters to family

         active involvement in such organizations as the 
         <corpname>Robert E. Lee Memorial Foundation</corpname>, the 
         <corpname>Woodrow Wilson Foundation</corpname>, the 
         <corpname>National Women's Liberty Loan

         Defense</corpname>, the

      <p>Other topics include letters concerning a trip made by 
         <persname>Betty Page Cocke</persname>to 
         <geogname>England</geogname>in 1937 to view the coronation of
         King 
         <persname>George VI</persname>and a subsequent tour of 
         <geogname>Europe</geogname>during which she injured her hip
         and had to return home for a long convalescence.
         Correspondence concerning the involvement of 
         <persname>Betty Page Cocke</persname>in the settlement of
         several Cocke family estates include those of 
         <persname>Leila B. Cocke</persname>, ca. 1925-1930 where Betty
         acted as the administratrix, 
         <persname>Rowena L. Cocke</persname>, ca. 1961, and 
         <persname>Mazyck Wilson Shields</persname>, ca. 1942. These
         papers describe the sale of items from the plantation of " 
         <corpname>Bremo</corpname>, " 
         <geogname>Fluvanna County, Virginia</geogname>, at auction in
         1926 and the proposed formation of the 
         <corpname>Bremo Plantation Inc.</corpname>from the property of

      <p>Other correspondents and subjects include: 
         <persname>Robert D. Ballantine</persname>, who was supposed to
         have committed suicide partly because 
         <persname>Betty Cocke</persname>rejected him (17 Nov 1896; 4
         Jan and 6 Feb 1897; 25 Oct and 31 Dec 1901), letters

         <persname>Thomas Nelson Page</persname>to "Miss Cocke" (2 Dec
         1902) concerning her request to "hear him read for her."
         Letters concerning artwork include: several to 
         <persname>John Bowdoin Cocke</persname>about the sale of a

         letters from representatives of the

         correspondence of 
         <persname>Betty Cocke</persname>with the

         (Oct 11, 28, and Nov 9, 1940; and Jan 15, 1941).</p>
      <p>The letters of 
         <persname>Milton C. Elliot</persname>are chiefly concerned
         with business matters, especially those to Betty regarding the
         buying and selling of property and the 
         <persname>Leila B Cocke</persname>estate; but also include
         letters to his sons,
