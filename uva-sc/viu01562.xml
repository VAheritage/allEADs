      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This document, a court decree dated February 15, 1864,
         concerns a group of twenty-six slaves to be divided among the
         heirs of Mrs. Frances Hamilton, widow of John Hamilton [of
         Virginia?]. 
         <emph render="super">1</emph></p>
      <p>The slaves, valued at $37,750, were divided into seven lots
         for distribution among Richard W. and Sally Baker; James and
         Anne I[eeson?]; William A. Hamilton, John F. Hamilton; ? C.
         Hamilton; Robert P. Hamilton; and Martha Leffew. Each lot was
         worth $5,392.85 but separate from the slaves was a sixty-two
         year-old female slave named Betsy "nearly blind and
         Valueless"; the other legatees paid the sum of $500 to William
         Hamilton "for the keeping for life the said slave." (George W.
         Booker, Samuel Baker, James Whitehead, John P. Hamilton, Isiah
         [Isaiah?] Cunningham, and James Whitehead are also mentioned
         in this document.)</p>
      <p>Values for these slaves vary considerably but the mothers
         of at least two children were particularly valuable: Esther,
         age 34, "not healthy," and her two children (three month-old
         Jarretta and Mack, three years old), were appraised at $1,750;
         Lindy, age 26, and her two children (nine month-old William
         Henry and four year-old Millow) and Lucy, age 31, and her two
         children (two year-old Newton and four year-old Jim) were
         worth $3,500 per family group.</p>
      <p><emph render="super">1</emph>There is no indication of the
         state in which this court was located but internal evidence
         indicates Virginia as a possibility. However, Frances and John
         Hamilton, Isiah Cunnigham and others were not enumerated in
         the 1850 or 1860 Census of Virginia.</p>
