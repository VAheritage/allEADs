      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Roger P. Bristol was born on July 15, 1903, in Ascutney,
         Vermont. He received his B.A. (1923) and M.A. (1926) degrees
         in English at Boston University; and later received his M.L.S.
         (1949) from Simmons College. Prior to accepting the position
         of Head of the Preparations Division at Alderman Library in
         1954, he served at Peabody Institute, and was the head
         cataloger at the Boston Public Library from 1947-1949. Bristol
         was responsible for many library systems improvements,
         especially in the addition of modern equipment. He researched
         the use of a closed-circuit television system in a
         decentralized library situation. He wrote numerous books,
         essays, and monographs on early American imprints as well as
         the vast Supplement to Charles Evans' American Bibliography.
         During his last ten years at the University, he served as
         Engineering Librarian in the School of Engineering where he
         directed a program which resulted in a significant expansion
         of facilities and services.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This group of personal papers and correspondence of the
         former Engineering Librarian at the University of Virginia's
         School of Engineering and Applied Science consists of 225
         items in the period 1953-1976. The correspondence covers
         Bristol's career at the University, his involvement in the
         modernization of library systems, library mechanization, and
         his work on the Supplement to Charles Evans' American
         Bibliography and the reprint of its Index. The material in the
         topical series is chiefly concerned with the Supplement, and
         includes Bristol's working copy, and book reviews and other
         related printed material.</p>
      <p>Correspondence with Jack Preston Dalton and John Cook
         Wyllie of Alderman Library details how Bristol first came to
         the University for an interview and eventually accepted the
         position as Head of the Preparations Division in 1954. There
         is also correspondence from Bristol's tenure as Engineering
         Librarian. During 1966-1973, Bristol orresponded with the
         American Antiquarian Society and the Bibliographical Society
         of America concerning the publication of his Supplement to
         Charles Evans'American Bibliography. Correspondence with
         Walker Cowen, Frederick R. Goff, John B. Hench, Marcus A.
         McCorison, Linton R. Massey, and James E. Mooney refers to
         negotiations and compromises made between the author,
         publisher, and printer.</p>
