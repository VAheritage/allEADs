         operations, including estimates of the amount of coal taken

      <p>Includes much information about its business relations with
         <corpname>Tredegar Iron Works</corpname>, Richmond, especially
         Charles P. Stone's suspicions of their motives in some of
         their actions (see pages 31-32, 41, 44-45. 58-59, 72, and

         in the ore banks of Amherst, Augusta, Chesterfield, Goochland,
         Henrico, and Rockbridge counties of Virginia.</p>
      <p>Other documents include a very detailed description of the
         property of the Dover Coal and Iron Company in Goochland
         County, Virginia, which was situated in the Richmond coal
         fields, with the James River and Kanawha Canal passing through
         it. The description was written by 
         <persname>Thomas Petherick</persname>and

         reports, receipts, notice of the intent of the directors to
         consolidate the Dover Company and the Westham Iron Company,
         formerly headed by its president,

         &amp; 30), minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors,

         (n.d.), financial summaries, and accounts. Also present is
         correspondence between Judge Joel Parker and 
         <persname>Wellington Goddin</persname>, a Richmond real estate
         auctioneer and land agent, ca. 1871-1874.</p>
