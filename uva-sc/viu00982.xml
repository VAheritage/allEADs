         operations, including estimates of the amount of coal taken

         Henrico, and Rockbridge counties of Virginia.</p>
         <p>Other documents include a very detailed description of the
         property of the Dover Coal and Iron Company in Goochland
         County, Virginia, which was situated in the Richmond coal
         fields, with the James River and Kanawha Canal passing through
         it. The description was written by 
         <persname>Thomas Petherick</persname>and 
         <persname>Charles P. Stone</persname>on December 13, 1865.</p>

         (n.d.), financial summaries, and accounts. Also present is
         correspondence between Judge Joel Parker and
