      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Virginia Blue Ridge Railway covered about nineteen
         miles from Tye River to Massie's Mill, Nelson County,
         Virginia, the site of its principal office. The railroad was
         incorporated on May 22, 1914, and was originally built to haul
         chestnut timber for two timber companies, the Leftwich Timber
         Company and the Tye River Timber Company, who needed a common
         carrier railroad to connect the two lumber mills by rail with
         the Southern Railway near the village of Tye River. The track
         laying for the ten miles of the main line was completed in
         1915, with the six mile spur into Massie's Mill becoming ready
         for use in October 1916. The carrier served the small towns of
         Massie's Mill, Lowesville, Woodson, Piney River, and Rose
         Mill.</p>
      <p>The original corporate officers of the Virginia Blue Ridge
         Railway when it was organized in 1914 were John W. Dwight
         (1859-1928), former U.S. Representative from New York,
         President; John W. Powell (?-1957) of Canisteo, New York,
         Vice-President and General Manager; Fordyce A. Cobb (?-1930),
         Secretary and Howard Cobb (?- [1948?]), Treasurer, both of
         Ithaca, New York; and Frank O. Lathrop, Superintendent.</p>
      <p>The Tye River Timber Company owned the timber rights to the
         Cub Creek area timber, which it agreed to sell to the Bee Tree
         Lumber Company. This latter company was created to run the
         Massie's Mill timber operation and a bandsaw mill. The Tye
         River Timber Company was a holding company for the timber,
         with Howard Cobb as President and John W. Dwight as Secretary,
         and headquarters at Lynchburg. The Bee Tree Lumber Company was
         a West Virginia Corporation with offices at Blue Jay, West
         Virginia, with A.M. Kistler as President and H.N. Crowell as
         Secretary. The Bee Tree Lumber Company mill ceased operations
         in 1922, after the Cub Creek timber had been harvested.</p>
      <p>The Leftwich Timber Company begun by R. Gilmore Leftwich
         (1875-1963), a Lynchburg businessman, was the second holding
         company created to secure timber rights and arrange with
         another company to build a mill to produce the lumber. The
         Leftwich Timber Company, with R.G. Leftwich as President and
         Howard Cobb as Secretary in 1913, owned timber rights to about
         12,000 acres. By 1915 a modern bandsaw mill was under
         construction at Woodson, Virginia. During the early years, the
         actual management of the mill and wood operations was handled
         by A.J. White and Son Company.</p>
      <p>When all railroads were nationalized during World War I,
         the two lumber mills were considered non-essential producers
         and the Virginia Blue Ridge Railway was shut down until after
         the Armistice was signed. The Woodson Mill resumed operations
         as the Woodson Lumber Company, but by 1924 the mill was closed
         permanently. The Leftwich Timber Company survived until 1944,
         when it consolidated with Tye River Timber Company into a
         company known as Tywich Corporation. The Tywich Corporation
         existed until June 2, 1959.</p>
      <p>Because of the chestnut blight and the intervention of
         World War I, the railroad never reached its full business
         potential by hauling milled timber to the main line of the
         Southern Railway. The Virginia Blue Ridge Railway was much
         more successful hauling freight for Southern Mineral Products
         Corporation, a subsidiary of Vanadium Corporation of America.
         This company established a mine, mill, and chemical plant in
         1930 at Piney River to manufacture titanium dioxide pigment, a
         substitute for white lead in making paint.</p>
      <p>The Dominion Mineral Division of the Riverton Lime and
         Stone Company in 1939 and the International Mineral and
         Chemical Company in 1941, both built plants to mine and mill
         the Nelson County aplite deposits. Aplite is a primary
         ingredient in the manufacture of glass and rock-wool
         insulation. The Piney River area in Nelson County is the only
         important source of aplite rock known to exist in the United
         States. Other minerals and commodities carried by the railway
         during its career include feldspar, ilmenite ore, calcium
         phosphate, ferrous sulphate, fertilizer, coal, sulphur, kaolin
         clays, cooperage stock, acid, apples, and pulp wood. For more
         information about the history of the Virginia Blue Ridge
         Railway and the timber companies, see Sentimental Journey by
         Carl M. Lathrop (1979) filed in Cubic 21 and copy in Rare
