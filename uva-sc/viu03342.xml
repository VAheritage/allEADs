      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>James Lawson Kemper (1823-1985), Confederate general and
         governor of Virginia, was born June 11, 1823, in Madison
         County, Virginia. He attended the Virginia Military Institute
         and Washington College, received his B.A. from the latter in
         1842, and commenced practicing law a year later. At the
         outbreak of the Mexican War in 1846 Kemper was comissioned a
         captain in the Virginia volunteers, but did not see active
         service. Returning to Virginia and his law practice, in 1853
         he married Cremora Conway Cave, affectionately called "Belle"
         by her husband. They were to have six children. The same year
         Kemper was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates for the
         first of five terms, the last (1861-1863) as speaker of the
         house. He headed the committee on military affairs and was
         appointed president of the Board of Visitors at the Virginia
         Military Institute. In 1861 Kemper advocated calling the state
         convention that eventually declared Virginia's secession from
         the Union on April 17.</p>
      <p>Kemper joined the Confederate army receiving a comission as
         colonel of the 7th Virginia Regiment on May 2, 1861. He led
         his regiment with great skill and valor at First Bull Run and
         Williamsburg, which resulted in his promotion to brigadier
         general on June 3, 1862. Commanding a brigade in the Army of
         Northern Virginia, he fought in the Seven Days Battles, Second
         Bull Run (where he temporarily commanded a division),
         Antietam, and Fredericksburg. After serving with Longstreet's
         First Corps in North Carolina during the Battle of
         Chancellorsville, he rejoined Lee's army as a brigade
         commander for the Gettysburg campaign in Pickett's division.
         At Gettysburg, Kemper led his brigade in the ill-fated
         Pickett's charge of July 3, 1863, and was severely wounded and
         captured. Returned on a prisoner exchange in 1864, he was
         deemed unfit for futher field service, and was relegated to
         the command of the Virginia Reserves. Kemper was promoted to
         major general on September 19, 1864, and after Appomattox he
         was paroled by United States military authorities on May 2,
         1865.</p>
      <p>Kemper returned to his law practice and resumed his
         involvement in politics in Reconstrudction-era Virginia. He
         favored reconciliation with the north with an eye to
         rebuilding Virginia's shattered economy by attaching
         railroads, commercial business, and industry to the Old
         Dominion. At first he opposed the reign of the Republican
         Party under President Ulysses S. Grant, attending the 1860
         Democratic National Convention, and speaking for presidental
         candidate Horace Greeley in 1872. In 1873, with the support of
         General William "Billy" Mahone, the powerful postwar
         Conservative Party leader, Kemper captured the party
         nomination for governor, and won the ensuing election. His
         campaign made no attacks on the Grant administration, adopting
         a "wait-and-see" attitude. As John Scott wrote to Kemper on
         December 18, 1873 after taking to Grant, "when they have got
         the whites of Virginia as allies they can then let the negro
         go and will do it." Later, Kemper's support of Grant led to
         rumors of a Grant-Kemper ticket in 1876.</p>
      <p>As governor Kemper urged full civil rights and protection
         for the freedmen. Believing that the state should pay its
         debts, Kemper broke with Mahone and joined the "Debt-payer"
         faction in fighting the "Readjustors" or "Repudiators" in
         state politics. He also fought for a new constitution and the
         restoration of Virginia to normal relations with the United
         States. After his term as governor, he returned to his law
         practice, and died in April 7, 1985, in Orange County,
         Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The James Lawson Kemper papers contain the correspondence
         and the financial, legal, and political papers of James Lawson
         Kemper (1823-1895), lawyer, Confederate general, and governor
         of Virginia (1874-1877).</p>
      <p>The correspondence series covers the years 1826 to 1905,
         with most material dating from the period between 1848 and
         1895. Early letters (pre-1861) illustrate Kemper's growing law
         practice and his involvement in politics, culminating in five
         terms in the Virginia House of Delegates. Many letters pertain
         to national politics, including the presidental elections of
         1852, 1856, and 1860, and mention such national figures as
         Stephen A. Douglas, James Buchanan, Henry A. Wise, and R. M.
         T. Hunter. State politics are discussed in detail, as are the
         improvement of the Virginia militia system, railroad
         construction, Kemper's dispute with Dr. George N. Thrift with
         threatened his political career, and military preparations in
         the south in the pre-Civil War period. The letters portray
         Kemper's importance in the political scene immediately prior
         to the outbreak of hostilities, and his leadership in calling
         for the state convention which led to Virginia's secession
         from the United States on April 17, 1861.</p>
      <p>The correspondence from the period of Kemper's service in
         the Confederate army from 1861 to 1865 concerns the various
         commands he held throughout the conflict. Most of the material
         pertains to military operations in Virginia in 1861, including
         the first Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) on July 21, 1861.
         Correspondents and endorsements include Brigadier (later
         Lieutenant) General James B. Longstreet, Major General John B.
         Gordon, Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and Major
         Walter H. Taylor, General Robert E. Lee's aide-de-camp. There
         is a letter from Major General Ethan A. Hitchock, U.S.V.,
         explaining to Kemper's wife Belle that she could not see her
         captured and badly wounded husband because Confederate
         authorities had refused the same courtesies to a Union
         family.</p>
      <p>Correspondence from the years of Reconstruction, 1865 to
         1877, concerns Kemper's investment speculations, legal
         business, recollections of the Battle of Gettysburg, and his
         political career, including his campaign and election to the
         governorship in 1873 on the Conservative Party ticket. Several
         letters from John A. Wise explain to Kemper why his father, a
         pre-war governor of Virginia Henry A. Wise, could not bring
         himself to endorse Kemper for the governorship. Much of the
         correspondence during his governorship concerns three topics:
         Kemper's veto of the Petersburg charter, which would have
         removed political power from the blacks residing there; the
         dispute over payment of the state debt; and Kemper's relations
         with President Ulysses S. Grant. There is a series of letters
         between Kemper and William Mahone, Confederate general and
         politician, regarding Kemper's choice of words in a speech
         attackign Mahone's stand on the state debt. Also included is a
         letter from Major General Fitz-John Parker, U.S.V., asking for
         evidence to be used in Porter's attempt to vindicate his
         conduct at Second Bull Run on August 29, 1862, for which he
         was later removed from command. Correspondents include
         ex-Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens,
         Conservative Party chairman Nathaniel B. Meade, John Scott of
         the pro-Grant faction in the Conservative Party, former
         Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal Early of the Southern
         Historical Society, and Democratic politicans and editor
         Manton Marble.</p>
      <p>Most of the correspondence following Kemper's return to
         private life in 1878 until his death in 1895 regards personal
         affairs. Many letters concern the education of Kemper's
         children and their attempts to earn a living. Several letters
         refer to the disappearance of Kemper's son James, Kemper's
         attempts to collect on James' life insurance policy, and the
         efforts of the insurance company to recover the money when
         James turned up alive several years later. Other
         correspondence covers topics such as Kemper's farm, Virginia
         politics, and Confederate history. At the end of this section
         are several manuscripts written by Kemper relating to his
         estate, his will, and religious matters. Also included here
         are two drafts of Kemper's farewell address to his brigade in
         1864, written after he had been wounded at Gettysburg and
         temporarily taken prisoner.</p>
      <p>The series of financial papers, dating from 1843 to 1895,
         contains bills and receipts from Kemper's business
         transactions as a lawyer and a farmer. This series includes
         Kemper's account books, ledgers, and checkbooks.</p>
      <p>The legal papers series, dating from 1854 to 1893, gives
         some idea of Kemper's law practice. Among the major topics are
         the estate settlements of R.A. Banks, Thomas Shirley, and
         Kemper's brother John S. Kemper, and Kemper's guardianship of
         Susan and William Matthews. Wills, bonds, deeds, court fees,
         licences, land surveys, bankrupcy notices, and arguments from
         several court cases are also included.</p>
      <p>The series of political papers, dating from 1860 to 1876,
         includes a political scrapbook from the 1860 presidental
         campaign, Kemper's drafts of his annual messages as governor
         in 1874 and 1876, and an undated speech by John Massie on the
         state debt controversy.</p>
      <p>The printed material series spans the years 1853 to 1985.
         It includes material on political campaigns, the Conservative
         Party, masonry, state militia affairs, schools, the Civil War
         and Reconstruction. Also included are several advertisements,
         and a copy of a speech by Kemper upon the presentation of the
         first Jackson-Hope medals at Virginia Military Institute.
         Several photographs of Kemper and his children are at the end
         of this section followed by one box of Kemper's books and four
         boxes of unsorted envelopes and fragments of letters.</p>
