      <p>This collection consists of 19 letters, June 4, 1862 to
         July 20, 1864, of Sergeant Albert F. Allen, Company A (?), 9th
         Rhode Island Volunteers and his brother Corporal Charles H.
         Allen, Company G, 10th Rhode Island Volunteers, to their
         sister, Mrs. George W. Simmons, Bristol, Rhode Island. (The
         typescripts variously give Albert Allen's middle initial as
         "G," "H," "L" or "Y.") For further information about these
         Rhode Island regiments, see Edwin Stone,

         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">History of the Ninth and Tenth Rhode

         1892), 121-316, 361-384, 385- 409.</p>
      <p>The 9th and 10th Rhode Island regiments were assigned to
         garrison duty at various forts in or near Washington, D.C. and
         Virginia during the period which the Allen letters were
         written. Most of the letters (seventeen) were written by
         Albert. He and his brother discuss camp, family and state news
         including the election of James Y. Smith as governor of Rhode
         Island (April 6, 1863), Union Major General John Joseph
         Abercrombie (April 20, 1863), snowfall in Virginia (April 6,
         1863 and March 26, 1864), the cost of butter in Washington
         (March 26, 1864), the arrival of wounded Confederate prisoners
         by train (May 6, 1863), issuing of Sibley tents and a clam
         bake by soldiers (August 15, 1863), the visit of the Russian
         Imperial Fleet (December 15, 1863), and a fire at the
         Washington Navy Yard (January 28, 1864).</p>
