      <p>This collection of 290 items, 1878-1923, and n.d., consists
         mainly of letters to Annie Seddon (Bruce) Page (1867-1888),
         the daughter of Charles and Sarah (Seddon) Bruce. Charles
         Bruce was originally from Halifax County, Virginia. Sarah
         Seddon was the youngest sister of his brother-in-law, the
         Honorable James A. Seddon. They resided at "Staunton Hill" in
         Charlotte County, Virginia after their marriage. The material
         in this collection relates chiefly to Annie and her family, as
         well as to Thomas Nelson Page (1853-1922), her husband, and
         his family, of Oakland Plantation, Hanover County,
         Virginia.</p>
      <p>Most of the letters are from Thomas Nelson Page to Annie
         throughout their courtship and marriage, from 1883 to 1888.
         The letters are principally love letters, but they also
         contain information about his literary career and legal
         practice in Richmond with Thomas Nelson Carter, his cousin. A
         letter of March 1, 1885 mentions James 
         <persname normal="Gillespie">G[illespie]</persname>Blaine
         (1830-1893), [Grover] Cleveland (1837-1908); hearing Mark
         Twain and [George Washington] Cable (1844-1925) read; seeing
         the opera "Falka"; and political musings. A March 24, 1885
         letter mentions a meeting with a Mr. [Charles?] Scribner, a
         publisher in New York, and a publishers' dinner where he met
         other authors, including [William Henry] Bishop (1847-1928), 
         <persname normal="Henry">H[enry]</persname><persname normal="Cuyler">C[uyler]</persname>Bunner
         (1855-1896), and George Parsons Lathrop (1851-1898), Nathaniel
         Hawthorne's son-in-law; a program from '"Mark Twain" Cable
         Readings.' On March 31, 1885, he discusses submitting his book
         to [Edward Livermore] Burlingame (1848-1922) and being asked
         to revise it, and mentions [Richard Watson] Gilder (1844-1909)
         in connection with the book. In letters from April 4 to July
         30, 1885, he mentions the progress he is making on a story,
         revealed in later letters as "Meh Lady". There are similar
         mentions of stories-in-progress throughout his correspondence
         with Annie. A May 6, 1885 letter discusses his law practice
         and refers to two cases. In his June 25, 1885 letter, he
         refers to a trip to New York where he tried a case; discusses
         a visit to Scribner and Sons; mentions a novel, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Across the Chasm</title>, by a Virginia
         woman author, [Julia Magruder (1854-1907)]; and mentions a
         visit to Mrs. [Sophia M'Ilvaine Bledsoe] Herrick's
         (1837-1919). He also mentions that other people have political
         aspirations for him in letters of September 2, 1885 and July
         22, 1887. On October 8, 1885, he mentions meeting President
         Cleveland in Washington, D. C. An October 10, 1885 letter
         mentions an earthquake in Richmond, but does not give many
         details. Letters of November 7 and 14, 1885 mentions his
         practice and some cases. Page attended the University of
         Virginia in 1873, and a letter dated November 29, 1885, refers
         to his work on the school newspaper at the University. The
         same letter also expresses his self-doubt and refers to an
         editorial in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sunday State</title>mentioning himself
         along with [George Washington] Cable and Joel Chandler Harris.
         From these letters, we also get some glimpse of social life in
         Virginia. In letters dated December 16, 23, 24, and 27, 1885
         to Annie, Page mentions dinner parties and other social
         occasions. Throughout 1885, he discusses his
         works-in-progress, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Unc' Edingburg</title>, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Meh Lady</title>, and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Red Rock</title>.</p>
      <p>A letter of January 19, 1886 mentions 
         <persname normal="Henry">H[enry]</persname><persname normal="Cuyler">C[uyler]</persname>Bunner. On
         February 2, he mentions encounters with [Richard Watson]
         Gilder, [Henry Mills] Alden (1836-1919), and Howard [Randolph]
         Bayne (1851-1933). A letter of February 13, 1886 mentions
         Alden, [Montgomery] Schuyler (1843-1914), and Charles Scriber
         (1854-1930). On February 24, 1886, he mentions the indictment
         of two men from creditors' corporations. On April 1, 1886, he
         discusses his comparisons to [George Washington] Cable and
         [Mary Noailles] Murfree (1850-1922) as defender of the "Old
         South." Both Annie and Thomas seem to have been prone to
         illnesses. Annie's were usually concerned with her eyes, as
         mentioned in an April 3, 1886 letter, and later in the
         correspondence. Page mentioned being forced to take a break
         from working and writing in order to recover from malaria in
         two letters, dated April 30 and May 13, 1886. On May 15, 1886,
         he mentions 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Meh Lady</title>being published in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Century</title>soon. Letters of May
         27 and 28 mention [William] Gordon McCabe (1841- ) and John 
         <persname normal="Codman">C[odman]</persname>Ropes
         (1836-1899). Letters of June 3 and 4 mention 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Meh Lady</title>, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Marse Chan</title>, and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Unc' Edinburg</title>.</p>
      <p>A July 7, 1887 letter mentions Jim [James Douglas] Bruce
         (1862-1923). There is mention of Charles Scribner in a July 8,
         1887 letter. On July 22, 1887, a meeting to appoint delegates
         to the Roanoke Convention is mentioned. Page's letters also
         describe his search for a house in Richmond (July 26 and
         August 4 and 7, 1887). In an August 12, 1887 letter, Page
         mentions signing a contract for a house which he describes in
         some detail. Page also mentions family servants, "Old Balla"
         and Tildy, in letters dated July 10 and August 7, 1887.</p>
      <p>Letters from July 15, 1886 and December 7, 1887 mention
         some of Page's speaking engagements. The second one mentioned
         was at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. While in
         Nashville, he did several public readings of his stories, and
         he describes how he was received (December 8, 1887 letter). In
         an October 18, 1888 letter, he mentions a trip to
         Charlottesville and a visit to the University where he saw
         Professors [William Elisha] Peters (1829-1906) and
         [Maximilian] Schele de Vere (1820-1898). He also mentions his
         fraternity, Delta Psi, and having read some of his works for
         an audience there.</p>
      <p>An undated letter, August 5, [post 1886?], mentions an
         accident on the C &amp; O Railroad the previous night, giving
         some details about the accident. Another undated letter, April
         9, mentions his desire to write a novel about the Old South to
         set the record straight.</p>
      <p>The next group of letters are from family members and
         friends to Anne. Letters from Ellen (Bruce) Baylor, Annie's
         sister, contain family matters and references to local people
         and events. A letter of August 5, 1887, mentions the tobacco
         harvest at Staunton Hill.</p>
      <p>There are six letters from Charles Bruce to his daughter
         Annie from 1883 to 1887. The earlier letters are filled with
         moral instructions for Annie as well as fatherly concern. In a
         January 20, 1887 letter, Bruce mentions an "African village
         beyond the stable" at Staunton Hill, probably referring to the
         quarters of servants and workers there.</p>
      <p>Mary (Anderson) Bruce wrote several letters to Annie, her
         sister-in-law. Three letters dated June 26, 30, and July 4,
         1886 mention Annie's engagement and wedding plans. Letters of
         February 23 and March 22, 1888 describe some of her trip to
         New Orleans, Louisiana; St. Louis, Missouri; and, St. Paul,
         Minnesota.</p>
      <p>There are several letters, 1886-1888, in the collection to
         Annie from her mother, Sarah (Seddon) Bruce. They mention
         family matters and local happenings. She corresponded with
         Annie and Thomas while they were in Europe following their
         marriage.</p>
      <p>Letters from Charles Washington Coleman, Jr. to Annie
         mention his visits to Staunton Hill as a friend of Annie and
         Douglas, one of Annie's brothers. He seems to have been a
         potential suitor for Annie.</p>
      <p>There are four letters from Nellie and Meade Minnigerode to
         Annie. All of these were written from Europe and describe her
         experiences in Brussels, Amsterdam, and other cities. Nellie
         spent at least a month in Paris. A letter of December 7, 1886,
         from Paris, discusses her experiences in Amsterdam,
         Netherlands and Berlin, Germany; describes travel in Europe
         through Germany, Austria, and France; and, mentions the Crown
         Prince and stag suppers. A June 23, 1887 letter, from London,
         mentions the birth of their son, Meade (1887-1967).</p>
      <p>There are several letters from Elizabeth Burwell (Nelson)
         Page, Annie's mother-in-law. Most of her letters were written
         from "Oakland," the Page family home. Letters of March 3 and
         July 9, 1886 mention her brother, 
         <persname normal="Robert">R[obert]</persname>Nelson of
         Charlottesville. On March 16, 1886, she mentions "old Balla"
         and "others of his race," and some consumptive cases. A letter
         of April 24, 1886 mentions Hugh Thomas Nelson (1805- ) of
         Charlottesville treating Thomas Nelson Page's illness. She
         mentions that the rivers in their area had overflowed and
         prevented travel in a July 9, 1886 letter. She mentions Dr.
         Hugh Thomas Nelson of Charlottesville in an April 24, 1886
         letter. "Old Balla" is mentioned again in one of Elizabeth's
         letters (March 16, 1888).</p>
      <p>Letters from various family members span the period 1878 to
         1887 and include letters from Annie's brothers to their
         mother, letters to Annie from Rosewell Page, and letters to
         Annie from her cousins. Included are: December 1, 1878, from
         Charles Morelle Bruce; October 3, 1886, from J. Douglas Bruce,
         Berlin, Germany, concerning life there; and, April 18 and June
         29, 1887, from J. Douglas Bruce, describing his visit to
         Vienna, Austria and Prague, Czechoslavakia, in detail. On
         November 3, 1887, Rosewell Page wrote concerning a speech
         about the organization of a railroad company from Danville,
         Virginia and Henderson, North Carolina. Miscellaneous letters
         covering the period 1882-1888 are from friends and
         acquaintances to Anne. They include receipts and details from
         Annie's wedding preparations. There is a letter, April 15,
         1887, from Amelie Rives (1863-1945), in response to sympathy
         for her cousin Alice's death. Mary Gordon Pryor Rice wrote on
         July 28 and August 9, 1887, discussing Tolstoi and Amelie
         Rives. An undated letter from M. P. Myers, mentions Julia Ward
         Howe (1819-1910) and women's rights.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous letters to Thomas Nelson Page, 1884 to 1887,
         are from friends, family, and business and literary contacts.
         On August 24 and 25, James R. Osgood of Harper and Brothers,
         London, wrote, mentioning [James] Brander Matthews
         (1852-1929). In a September 5, 1886 letter, William W. Archer
         mentions Virginia's lack of literary giants, discusses Thomas'
         literary contributions and compares some writers to him, such
         as Virginius Dabney (1835-1894) and Mary Greenway McClelland
         (1853-1895). There are two letters, September 9 and 16, 1886,
         from Elizabeth Burwell (Nelson) Page, chiefly about personal
         and family news. On September 13, 1886,
