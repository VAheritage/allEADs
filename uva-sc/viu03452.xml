      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection is comprised of personal papers of Charles
         E. Moran of Charlottesville, Virginia, from his activities
         with two groups, the Save Our Schools Committee, 1955-1956,
         and the Offender Aid and Restoration Committee of
         Charlottesville-Albemarle, 1970-1975.</p>
      <p>The first part of the collection, comprising ca. 30 items,
         focuses on the Charlottesville Save Our Schools Committee, an
         organization founded in December 1955 in response to efforts
         in Virginia to circumvent the Supreme Court Ruling ( 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Brown v. the Board of
         Education</title>) outlawing segregation in American public
         schools.</p>
      <p>Virginia segregationists, including University of Virginia
         President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., sought to negate the Supreme
         Court ruling and preserve Virginia's dual school system by
         channeling state monies into private schools for whites. An
         amendment to the state constitution authorizing this project
         was submitted to the voters in a referendum of January 9,
         1956.</p>
      <p>The Save Our Schools Committee of Charlottesville (with
         like-minded organizations in various parts of the state) was
         created in response to the segregationist maneuver. As the
         materials in the collection indicate, the organization, headed
         by University of Virginia Press Director Charles E. Moran,
         Jr., was, despite its size, a forceful voice for compliance
         with the Supreme Court ruling. According to Moran, in an
         interview with the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New York Times</title>, "Negroes will
         never be full sized citizens until they have actual equal
         opportunities." Hence his opposition to the state
         constitutional amendment proposal, and support for a bi-racial
         advisory council which would work at both state and local
         levels to respect local traditions while moving toward
         compliance with the Supreme Court ruling.</p>
      <p>The strength of anti-Negro sentiment in Virginia at this
         time is evidenced in the arguments used by the Save Our
         Schools Committee in their anti-amendment propaganda. In
         handouts and radio and television addresses they emphasized
         the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">costs</title>of a system wherein the
         state subsidized private schools, and the likelihood that,
         once the money was channeled into such schools, the courts
         would declare this action unconstitutional. The Save Our
         Schools literature evinces no 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">moral</title>appeals to Virginians'
         consciences; they made pocketbook arguments solely.</p>
      <p>In addition to the newspaper editorial favorable to the
         compliance position, and the organization's own propaganda,
         the collection contains listings of those favorable to the
         Save Our Schools stance, some leaflets favorable to the
         proposed amendment, several drafts of the plan put forward by
         those who accepted the Supreme Court's ruling, and some
         documents regarding the Saving Our Schools Committee's
         finances.</p>
      <p>The second part of the collection, consisting of ca. 100
         items, 1970-1975, concerns the Offender Aid and Restoration
         Committee of Charlottesville-Albemarle, an organization
         committed to voluntary assistance for inmates of the
         Charlottesville prison. The collection includes the
         organization's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, monthly
         program reports, minutes of advisory board meetings, facts
         sheets, pamphlets, and lists of books in the Charlottesville
         City Jail. The collection also reflects, in several memos and
         one award, the contributions of Charles E. Moran, Jr., as OAR
         participant, financial contributor and supporter via the
         Charlottesville Society of Friends.</p>

      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>The collection has been divided into two parts, arranged
         separately, The Save Our Schools Committees collection begins
         with correspondence and is followed by lists of supporters,
         the committee's alternative plan for Virginia schools,
         propaganda, financial records and newspaper articles. The
         Offender Aid and Restoration materials also have been
         organized with correspondence first, followed by minutes and
         monthly reports, pamphlets, and miscellaneous items.</p>
