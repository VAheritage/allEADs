      <p>This collection consists of a small one volume diary of a
         National Guardsman who was called out from August 5-16, 1917,
         being mustered into Federal Service on August 16, 1917. He
         drilled in St. Louis, Missouri, until September 30, 1917, and
         arrived at the Field Artillery School in Fort Sill, Comanche
         County, Oklahoma, on October 1, 1917. He remained at Fort Sill
         until May 10, 1918, when he left to travel from Topeka,
         Kansas, across the United States to Camp Mills on Long Island,
         New York, arriving on May 14. The soldier visited New York
         City on the 15th, left Camp Mills to board the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">R.M.S. Saxonia</title>in the New York
         City Harbor on the 20th, and reached Halifax, Nova Scotia, on
         May 23, 1918.</p>
      <p>On the trip across the ocean to England, he saw ice bergs
         (May 26, 1918) and experienced submarine attacks (June 2 &amp;
         3). England was sighted on June 4th and he traveled across
         England to Southampton to board the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Arbroath</title>for Havre, France (June
         7-8). He crossed France, arriving first at La Membrolle and
         then La Rouissier on the Loire River, billeting first in a
         grainery and then in a chateau (June 10-July 8), and mentioned
         swimming in the river, the dispersal of gas masks, working on
         the new guns, and the poor quality and quantity of the food.
         On July 9th, he left La Rouissier for Guer, located fifty
         miles away, and Camp [Cortquidan?]. There he began training to
         fire the [French] 75 mm artillery guns (Jul 15-Aug 6),
         mentioning the return of Corporal Dickey from Gas School as
         one of the Battery Gas N.C.O. s (Jul 23, 1918).</p>

         11); the drive through Nancy to reach the Front (Sep 12); and

         first barrage (Sep 23-26); McCarty of "A" Battery killed near
         Cheppy (Sep 27); infantry very badly shot up, relieved from
         duty, passing over the ground where the drive took place and
         seeing terrible sights (Sep 28, 1918).</p>
      <p>Descriptions of a three day trip to Rosnes and return to
         the front (Oct 13, 1918), where he takes charge of the third
         section (Oct 26); Germans drop a few "whiz bangs" close by
         (Nov 2); his transfer to detail as instrument sergeant (Nov
