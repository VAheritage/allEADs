      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection contains ca. 139 items, 1850-1863, 1882
         &amp; 1986 (one Hollinger box, 0.5 shelf feet), chiefly
         letters written by 
         <persname>Charles H. Thurston</persname>, a Confederate
         soldier in 
         <corpname>Company H, Seventh Louisiana
         Volunteers</corpname>("Crescent Rifles"), [William Henry
         Talbot] Walker's Brigade, [Jubal P.] Early's Division, [Thomas
         J. "Stonewall"] Jackson's Corps, the Army of Northern
         Virginia. Thurston was a great-grandson of Anne Scott
         Jefferson (a sister of Thomas Jefferson) who married Hastings
         Marks.</p>
      <p><persname>Charles Thurston</persname>was born on October 21,
         1840, in Evansville, Indiana, the son of 
         <persname>Thomas Gates Thurston</persname>(1800-1853) and 
         <persname>Diana Moore Gwathmey</persname>(1811-1893). Four
         years after his birth the family moved to his mother's
         birthplace, Louisville, Kentucky; at one point they settled in
         Sabine County, Texas, where his father owned a salt factory.
         Thurston was employed as a pilot on a houseboat, Ida, on the
         Tensas River from 1857 to 1858; during 1858 to 1861 he worked
         as a shipping clerk in Trinity, Louisiana, and became head
         clerk at the Mansion House Hotel in Natchez, Mississippi.</p>
      <p>He joined the 
         <corpname>Louisiana Crescent Rifles</corpname>in 
         <geogname>New Orleans</geogname>during April, 1861. Two months
         later he enlisted as a private in the Confederate Army at 
         <geogname>Camp Moore, Louisiana</geogname>, and was assigned
         to the Seventh Louisiana. He participated in several battles
         and was briefly held by Union forces after the battle of 
         <geogname>Winchester</geogname>(May 25, 1862) but apparently
         escaped or was exchanged. In July, 1862, he was declared unfit
         for duty and ordered to the rear. Thurston died on July 22,
         1862, aged twenty-one, from injuries suffered during a train
         derailment near 
         <geogname>Danville Station</geogname>while traveling from 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>to 
         <geogname>Lynchburg, Virginia</geogname>, and was buried on
         the Daniel Stewart Farm in Farmville. In an 1862 clothing and
         pay account inventory Thurston was described as having "gray
         eyes, brown hair, dark complexion" and being five feet eight
         inches in height.</p>
      <p>Thurston's war letters, 1861-1862 (ca. twenty-six items),
         are usually accompanied by electrostatic typescripts. In them
         he describes camp life, marching, picket duty, his desire for
         an officer's commission, and his participation in the battle
         of First 
         <geogname>Bull Run</geogname>(July 26, 1861). Other battles
         discussed include: the 
         <geogname>Santa Rosa Island</geogname>Raid (October 16, 1861);
         the attempt by the Confederate ironclad ram Manassas to break
         the Federal blockade at Head of Pass on the 
         <geogname>Mississippi River</geogname>, and the defeat of the 
         <corpname>Sixth New York</corpname>(Zouaves) commanded 
         <persname>William Wilson</persname>(October 16, 1861); 
         <geogname>Ball's Bluff</geogname>(October 28, 1861); 
         <geogname>Fort Donelson</geogname>(February 25, 1862); and
         Shiloh (April 10, 1862). Also present are letters containing
         descriptions and impressions of various towns and Confederate
         army camps: 
         <geogname>Huntsville, Alabama</geogname>(June 17, 1861); 
         <geogname>Bristol</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Grand Junction, Tennessee</geogname>(June 17, 1861);
         Lynchburg (June 17 &amp; August 8, 1861); 
         <geogname>Camp Moore</geogname>(June 3, 1861); 
         <geogname>Camp Pickens, Manassas Junction,
         Virginia</geogname>(June 24, 1861); 
         <geogname>Camp Bienville, Centreville,
         Virginia</geogname>(September 15, 1861); 
         <geogname>Camp Reserve</geogname>(October 28, 1861); 
         <geogname>Camp Florida, Centreville</geogname>(November 18-19
         &amp; December 15, 1861); and 
         <geogname>Camp Carondelet, Manassas</geogname>(December 26,
         1861). The 
         <corpname>Washington Artillery of New Orleans</corpname>, the
         Sixth, Eighth, and Ninth Regiments of Louisiana Infantry and
         [Chatham R.] 
         <corpname>Wheat's Louisiana Battalion</corpname>("Tigers") are
         also mentioned.</p>
      <p>The letters also discuss other war-related events such as:
         railroad transportation of Confederate troops (June 17, 1861);
         speculation on whether 
         <geogname>Kentucky</geogname>would remain in the Union
         (September 15, 1861); the shelling of 
         <geogname>Arlington Heights</geogname>and General 
         <persname>George B. McClellan</persname>'s camp (September 22
         &amp; 28, 1861); the sighting of a Union observation balloon
         (October 20-21, 1861); praise of Confederate ironclads
         (October 21, 1861); the Trent Affair (November 8, 1861); life
         in winter quarters in "Growler's Den" and Camp Carondelet
         (December 15, 1861); and the evacuation of 
         <geogname>Nashville, Tennessee</geogname>(February 25,
         1862).</p>
      <p>Of special interest is Thurston's recounting of his removal
         of a toe from a dead Union soldier to send home (November
         18-19, 1861) and the execution of two members of the Louisiana
         Tigers by a firing squad of twenty-four men for threatening
         two officers of the 
         <corpname>Seventh Louisiana</corpname>(December 15, 1861).</p>
      <p>Prominent contemporaries mentioned in the correspondence
         include 
         <persname>Pierre G. T. Beauregard</persname>, 
         <persname>Braxton Bragg</persname>, 
         <persname>George Bibb Crittenden</persname>, 
         <persname>Jefferson Davis</persname>, 
         <persname>Albert Sidney Johnston</persname>, 
         <persname>Robert E. Lee</persname>, 
         <persname>Abraham Lincoln</persname>, 
         <persname>Thomas Overton Moore</persname>, 
         <persname>Richard "Dick" Taylor</persname>, 
         <persname>David Emanuel Twiggs</persname>, 
         <persname>Williams Henry Talbot Walker</persname>, and 
         <persname>Chatham R. Wheat</persname>. In addition, there is
         correspondence with various Confederate officers and citizens:
         <persname>A. J. Ashford</persname>(Confederate army surgeon); 
         <persname>A. Henning</persname>(2nd lieutenant, New Orleans
         Hansa? Guards); 
         <persname>James J. Irby</persname>, who is characterized as
         "the wealthiest citizen in Lynchburg" (August 8, 1861); and, 
         <persname>W. R. Harper</persname>(captain, Company H, Seventh
         Louisiana).</p>
      <p>A typescript copy of entries from Thurston's "special
         pocket notebook" (1857 &amp; 1861-1862) is with this
         collection and contains diary entries, poetry, notes on
         activities, comrades killed or wounded, army camps, and
         battles associated with his regiment. Several documents
         pertaining to the location of Thurston's grave are among these
         papers including a February 14, 1863 explanatory letter from a
         <persname>M. Rennick</persname>to 
         <persname>Thomas G. Thurston</persname>regarding his brother's
         death.</p>
      <p><persname>Charles Thurston</persname>'s antebellum papers,
         1850-1860, are comprised of correspondence with his mother, 
         <persname>Diana Thurston</persname>, his brother [and
         brother-in-law?] 
         <persname>Thomas G. Thurston</persname>and 
         <persname>John R. Wooldridge</persname>, his sister 
         <persname>Mary Thurston</persname>, and various acquaintances.
         Most were written by Thurston during his sojourns in 
         <geogname>Trinity, Louisiana</geogname>(1859-1860), and 
         <geogname>Natchez, Mississippi</geogname>(1860-1861) and
         discuss a drought and an epidemic; temperatures of 106 degrees
         fahrenheit in Natchez and 96 degrees in Evansville, Indiana
         (June 28, 1856); yellow fever in 
         <geogname>New Orleans</geogname>(August 10, 1860); the
         activities of a black slave, 
         <persname>Ann</persname>, who is allowed to visit her husband
         in August, 1860; the cleaning and fixing of Thurston's teeth
         (May 22, 1860); having a daguerreotype made of himself (June
         25, 1859); and general comments about his life, ship arrivals
         and departures, and family matters.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous materials include receipts, poetry by 
         <persname>Diana Thurston</persname>, a register, an 1850
         autobiography, and an electrostatic typescript of Thurston's
         account of his employment on the Ida with lists of
         plantations, farms, and overseers on the 
         <geogname>Macon Bayou</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Tensas River</geogname>, two 1882 letters from 
         <persname>D. Wooldridge</persname>, Chismville, Arkansas, to
         her grandmother ( 
         <persname>Diana Thurston</persname>) describing an outbreak of
         typhoid fever and the closure of schools due to the lack of
         teachers; and a "12 Generation Pedigree Chart" relating to
         members of the 
         <famname>Wooldridge</famname>, 
         <famname>Gwathmey</famname>,
