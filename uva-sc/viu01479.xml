      <p>John Brooks Henderson, Jr. (1870-1923) was born in
         Louisiana, Missouri, and attended Harvard, receiving his law
         degree from George Washington University in 1893. He was later
         a Republican candidate for Congress in 1906 from the eighth
         Virginia district. In 1901, he wrote 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">American Diplomatic Questions</title>.
         Henderson served as private secretary to former Secretary of
         State (under President Harrison) John Watson Foster
         (1836-1917). Foster was born in Pike County, Indiana, and
         received two degrees from Indiana University and attended
         Harvard Law School for one year. He was admitted to the
         Indiana Bar and practiced law at Evansville, 1857-1861, until
         he entered the Union Army as a major in the 25th Indiana
         Volunteers. He served as editor of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Evansville Daily Journal</title>,
         1865-1869 and became postmaster of Evansville in 1869-1873.
         After that he began his diplomatic career, serving as minister
         to Mexico (1873-1880), to Russia (1880-1881), to Spain
         (1883-1885), and as Secretary of State (1892- 1893).</p>
      <p>In 1894, Foster was invited as a private citizen by the
         Emperor of China to participate in the peace negotiations with
         Japan at the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese War; at that time
         he held no United States government position. The United
         States, being on friendly terms with both powers had
         maintained a policy of strict neutrality throughout the
         conflict. Foster had served as legal counsel to the Chinese
         legation in Washington, D.C., during the war and was well
         aware of the events transpiring in the Far East.</p>
      <p>On December 22, Foster received a telegram from the Tsungli
         Yamen (Foreign Office) requesting his counsel in assisting a
         Chinese commission headed by the elderly Viceroy, Li
         Hung-chang, appointed to negotiate the peace with Japan.
         Foster accompanied the Viceroy and his son, Li Ching-fong, to
         Shimonoseki, where negotionations were to be held. As a result
         of difficult negotiations with the Japanese, the peace terms
         proposed by the Japanese in the Treaty of Shimonoseki were
         finally reduced to the recogition by China of Korean
         independence, the cessation of Taiwan, the Pescadores, and the
         Liaotung Peninsula to Japan, the opening of four Chinese port
         cities as treaty ports, guarantees for Japanese citizens to
         operate factories in China and an indemnity of two million
         taels. The formal signing of the treaty took place in
         Shimonoseki on April 17, 1895. Later the Japanese relinguished
         their demand for the Liaotung Peninsula.</p>
      <p>Foster then traveled to Peking, where he encouraged the
         Tsungli Yamen on behalf of Li Hung-chang, to ratify the
         treaty. On May 8, 1895, the treaty was signed at Chefoo but
         the unpleasant task of transferring the island of Formosa
         (Taiwan) to the Japanese remained. The people of Taiwan had
         declared their independence in late May, establishing the
         Republic of Taiwan forcing the Japanese to fight to gain
         control of their new territory. The Japanese had demanded that
         the Chinese appoint a commission to handle the transfer so the
         Tsungli Yamen appointed Li Ching-fong, the son of the Chinese
         Viceroy Li Hung-chang, to this unpopular assignment. The
         Viceroy pleaded with Foster to accompany his son on this
         dangerous mission and he agreed to do so. The journal in this
         collection was kept by Henderson about this part of Foster's
         mission to China.</p>
