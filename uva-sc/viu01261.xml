      <p>According to the history of the Seventh Massachusetts
         Volunteer Infantry by Nelson V. Hutchinson (Rare Books E 513.5
         7th 1890), the regiment was recruited and organized at
         Taunton, Massachusetts by Colonel Darius N. Couch, and was
         sworn into service on June 15, 1861. Company K was recruited
         from Dorchester. On July 12th it proceeded to Washington, D.C.
         by railroad on order of the Secretary of War, arriving in
         Washington on July 15, 1861. Camp Brightwood was located at
         the junction of Seventh and Fourteenth Streets, some five
         miles from Washington, D.C.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of one letter from Frank [Erskine]
         and eleven autograph letters, 1861-1862, from Benjamin F.
         Hutchinson (d. 1862 September 1 at Craney Island, Virginia),
         serving with the 7th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer
         Infantry, to his wife, Mary Hutchinson. The letters were
         written from Camp Brightwood, District of Columbia, Camp
         Winfield Scott, near Yorktown, Virginia, ten miles from Fort
         Monroe, Warwick Court House, Prospect Hill, and Berkeley
         Landing, Virginia.</p>
      <p>The earliest letters are from Camp Brightwood, District of
         Columbia. In these, Hutchinson discusses: the wormy bread they
         had at first and making a stove out of flat stones and old tin
         dishes (1861 Oct 30); a mail robbery at the military post
         office at camp, the promotion of Colonel [Nelson H.?]Davis,
         the review of the regiment by Massachusetts Governor [John
         Albion?] Andrew (1818-1867), and visits to the Patent Office
         and the Smithsonian Institute (1861 Nov 20); the desertion of
         two men from Company K (1862 Jan 26); busy building a barracks
         during the winter, have three inches of snow and the new
         colonel was as drunk as a fool today ([1862 winter]); and the
         rumor about going to Texas, two more regiments arrived to take
         care of the forts, they have a new Colonel Davis as an
         officer, the camp of the Rhode Island 2nd [Regiment?]
         destroyed by an awful gale, which also killed a man in the New
         York 36th, and the celebration of George Washington's birthday
         (1862 Feb 26).</p>
      <p>The next letters describe camping at Prospect Hill,
         Virginia, without tents, where the troops have damaged the
         plantation owned by Commander Jones, and a Rhode Island boy
         found an old shell which exploded and killed him; tells his
         wife to direct her letters to Washington, Key's Division,
         Company K, 7th MV ([ca. 1862 Mar]); describes the march to
         Prospect Hill, Virginia, through deep mud, and back to Camp
         Brightwood, where Willard found a new revolver in the road
         (1862 Mar 16). Back at Camp Brightwood, he reports a rumor
         about General Ambrose Burnside meeting with a reversal (1862
         Mar 19).</p>
      <p>In the next letter, Hutchinson identifies his regiment as
         the 7th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, 4th Corps,
         [Darius N.?] Couch's Division, Brigg's Brigade, Company K,
         camped ten miles from Fort Monroe and 2.5 miles from Newport
         News, at [Camp W.F. Smith] where some are suffering from
         dysentery, "the [New] Yorkers have some of them died owing to
         being so dirty some say," saw Mount Vernon and the tomb of
         George Washington before they left, they started out from
         Alexandria on about fifty boats and were soon anchored at Fort
         Monroe and marched by the ruins of Hampton which had evidence
         of being a beautiful city with nothing left now but charred
         ruins, brick walls, and chimneys, land is very level with
         water close to the surface, Fort Monroe a grand fort with
         terrible guns, mentions the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Monitor</title>and a good many other
         gunboats, saw the sunken ships the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Cumberland</title>and the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Congress</title>, and says 70,000
         camped in the field that night (1862 Apr 3). He sends a brief
         message to his wife from Warwick Court House, saying they have
         killed enemy cows, hogs, and sheep for food (1862 Apr 7).</p>
      <p>At Camp Winfield Scott, during the siege of Yorktown, they
         are under shelling by the Rebels without much damage, five or
         six men were killed belonging to the 7th Maine Regiment,
         mentions a rumor that the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Merrimac</title>has been sunk, thirty
         men were killed trying to take a rebel battery, some siege
         guns are in position, Major [Franklin P.?] Harlow stole a
         Rebel picket's blanket and water dipper, and the men are
         suffering from a plague of wood ticks ([1862] Apr 18-19).</p>
      <p>The last letter is from Frank [Erskine?] written at
         Berkeley Landing, Virginia, and mentions the battle at Seven
         Pines, a long hard retreat from the Rebels, camping near a
         swamp, prevalent sickness, bad water, "as for taking Richmond
         this summer I think it is out of the question," building rifle
         pits and forts, and sends love from Samuel and her husband,
         B.F. Hutchinson (1862 Jul 7).</p>
