      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>During the Reconstruction period of Virginia history, Hugh
         Carr (1843-1914), probably a freed slave, and his wife, Texie
         Mae Hawkins (? - 1899) began the long process of purchasing
         various tracts of land that eventually made up the 160 acre
         model farm along Ivy Creek known as "River View." When Hugh
         Carr died in 1914, his daughter, Mary Carr, a teacher in
         Charlottesville, and later principal of the Albemarle Training
         School, inherited a sixth of the farm. When Mary Carr married
         Conley Greer, an Albemarle County Agricultural Agent, in 1916,
         they began to purchase the other five shares of the farm from
         Mary's sisters.</p>
      <p>After the death of Mrs. Greer, the farm was put up for sale
         and was in danger of becoming one of Charlottesville's newest
         subdivisions. Elizabeth Conant, a biology teacher at the
         University of Virginia, realized that the land was ideal for a
         nature preserve. She contacted the Nature Conservancy who
         bought the farm and held it until the City of Charlottesville
         and Albemarle County were able to buy the land. The Ivy Creek
         Foundation was incorporated on May 23, 1979, and the future
         management of the land lies with them. Paul Saunier, former
         University of Virginia administrator, was the first president
         of the Foundation. For further information about Mary Carr
         Greer and the Carr family see the Carr Family Papers (# 10,
         176, -a-f) in Special Collections, Manuscript Division.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers of the Ivy Creek Foundation of Albemarle County
         and Charlottesville, Virginia, consists of ca. 150 items (1
         Hollinger box), 1916-1954, 1966-1988, and n.d., and contains
         material pertaining to the acquisition of the property for the
         Ivy Creek Natural Area (ICNA), begun in 1975 by the
         intervention of the Nature Conservancy, and the formation of
         the Ivy Creek Foundation in 1979 to administer the area.</p>
      <p>This material includes two letters from Benjamin Whitten
         and T.C. Ritchie; legal and financial papers of Mary Carr
         Greer (1884-1973) and her husband, Conley Greer (? -1956), a
         local black family who ran a model farm named "River View" in
         the Ivy Creek area; newsclippings and articles about the
         formation of the ICNA and the work of its volunteers; research
         notes concerning the history of the Carr family and the
         transfers of title of the Carr property; notebooks entitled
         "ICNA History and Heritage" compiled by Price Smith in 1985,
         and the "Rann Preserve" kept by Elizabeth Conant; photographs
         of the ICNA, both aerial and ground level (including one
         oversize folder of ICNA photographs); copies of photographs of
         the Carr family; and a research paper entitled "Ivy Creek
         Natural Area. A Local Conservation Case Study" written by
         Patricia Farrell which explains how a local group concerned
         about conservation was able to purchase and administer the
         ICNA for the good of the whole Albemarle-Charlottesville
         area.</p>
      <p>Also present are copies of documents showing the various
         steps in the acquisition of the Ivy Creek property, first by
         the Nature Conservancy and then by the Ivy Creek Foundation.
         Also present is documentation of the original ownership of the
         land by the Carr-Greer family.</p>
      <p>The present day Ivy Creek Natural Area, which borders the
         South Rivanna Reservoir of the City of Charlottesville and
         consists of 215 acres of forest, field, and stream, was formed
         from several tracts of land. These include: 1) the original
         tract from the Mary Carr Greer Estate of eighty acres in 1975,
         2) a thirty-eight acre tract from the City of Charlottesville
         in 1979 3) the Fleming tract of eighty acres in 1981 4) the
         Flamenco tract of sixteen acres in 1981 and 5) four tenths of
         an acre from Bedford Moore in 1981. The Greer property was
         named the Rann Preserve when purchased by the Nature
         Conservancy and renamed the Ivy Creek Natural Area when
         purchased by the Ivy Creek Foundation.</p>
