      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>During the Reconstruction period of Virginia history,
        Hugh Carr (1843-1914), probably a freed slave, and his wife, Texie Mae Hawkins (1865-1899)
        began the long process of purchasing various tracts of land that eventually made up the
        model farm along Ivy Creek known as "River View" in the Union Ridge Hydraulic Mills
        community. The farm continued to grow and by 1890 it was over 125 acres making Carr among
        the largest African American landowner in Albemarle County. Carr and Texie Mae raised seven
        children at River View Farm, Mary Louise Carr Greer, (1884-1973), Fannie Carr Washington
        (1887-?), Peachie Carr Jackson (1889-1977), Emma Clorinda Carr (1892-1974), Virginia Carr
        Brown (1893-1935), Ann Hazel Carr (1895-?), and one son Marshall Hubert Carr (1886-1916).
        Having been himself deprived of any formal education, Carr placed an emphasis on education
        for his daughters and son, all of whom went to school. Many of his children earned college
        degrees, becoming teachers and community leaders. Mary Louise Carr became principal of
        Albemarle Training School and an influential educator in the local community. Later, she was
        honored for her commitment to education with the naming of Greer Elementary School after
        her. In 1916, Mary Carr married Conley Greer, the first African American extension agent for
        Albemarle County and the last family member to farm at River View Farm. After his death in
        1957, Mary Carr Greer continued to live there but the land was rented to local farmers to
        farm. When she died in 1973, she left the estate to her only child, Evangeline Greer, who in
        turn sold it. Following its sale, the farm was slated to become one of Charlottesville’s
        newest subdivisions with a projected 200 homes. Elizabeth Conant, a biology teacher at the
        University of Virginia, realized that the land was ideal for a nature preserve. She
        contacted the Nature Conservancy who bought the farm and held it until the City of
        Charlottesville and Albemarle County were able to buy the land. The Ivy Creek Foundation was
        incorporated on May 23, 1979, and the future management of the land lies with them. Paul
        Saunier, former University of Virginia administrator, was the first president of the
        Foundation. The Ivy Creek Natural Area, which currently borders the South Rivanna Reservoir
        of the City of Charlottesville and consists of 215 acres of forest, field, and stream, was
        formed from several tracts of land. These include the original tract from the Mary Carr
        Greer Estate of eighty acres in 1975, a thirty-eight-acre tract from the City of
        Charlottesville in 1979, the James Fleming tract of eighty- acres in 1981, the Flamenco
        tract of sixteen acres in 1981, and four tenths of an acre from Bedford Moore in 1981. The
        Greer property was named the Rann Preserve when purchased by the Nature Conservancy and was
        renamed the Ivy Creek Natural Area. The organizers of the Ivy Creek Natural Area recognized
        the history of the Carr family and worked to save and preserve the land as well as the
        family documents that were found in the farmhouse. Sources: Ivy Creek Foundation, Accessed

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head> 
      <p>This collection consists of the history of Hugh Carr, an
        African American born in enslavement in 1843 and his family who lived on a tract of land
        (River View Farm) that Carr bought in 1870 after emancipation. He became one of the largest
        African American landowners in Albemarle County, where he raised several generations of his
        family in the Union Ridge Hydraulic Mills community, until his death in 1914.The papers show
        that Carr highly valued education for his daughters as well as his son. His eldest daughter,
        Mary Louise Carr Greer became a well-known educator and principal of Albemarle Training
        School. Her family continued to live on the farm until 1978 when it became the Ivy Creek
        Natural Area with the support of the Nature Conservancy. There are documents, newspaper
        clippings, photographs, and yearbooks, all pertaining to the history of this prominent
        African American family. There are also papers pertaining to the founding of the Ivy Creek
        Natural Area. The collection materials were used for an article "Legacies" by Bernice
        Grohskopf published in Albemarle Magazine, June 1988, about River View Farm, the influence
        of the Carr family, and the preservation of the Ivy Creek Natural Area. Included is the
        original receipt for the purchase of land by Hugh Carr in 1870 in the amount of $100. There
        are two letters from Carr’s grandson Benjamin Whitten and T.C. Ritchie, and legal and
        financial papers of Mary Carr Greer (1884-1973), as well as her husband, Conley Greer (?
        -1956). Also included is a notebook entitled "Ivy Creek Natural Area History and Heritage"
        compiled by Price Smith in 1985, and the "Rann Preserve" kept by Elizabeth Conant,
        photographs of the ICNA, both aerial and ground level (including one oversize folder of ICNA
        photographs), a research paper entitled "Ivy Creek Natural Area, and a “Local Conservation
        Case Study" written by Patricia Farrell which explains how a local group concerned about
        conservation was able to purchase and administer the ICNA for the good of the whole
        Albemarle-Charlottesville area.</p>
