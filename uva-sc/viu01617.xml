            <p>This collection was given to the Library on August 17,

            Florida.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection consists of three letters pertaining to the
         Underwood family of Kentucky and Alabama. The earliest letter,
         May 8, 1813, from Joseph Rogers Underwood (1791-1876) to his
         uncle Edmund Rogers, was written aboard the Schooner Mary near
         Fort Meigs on the Miami River. Underwood informed Rogers that
         he had been taken as a prisoner of war by the British and
         their Indian allies after a brief skirmish near the swamps and
         assured them of his humane treatment by his captors.</p>
         <p>A related letter which described the circumstances of the
         preservation of the earlier letter was sent by Edmund Rogers'
         descendant and namesake, Edmund P. Rogers, May 8, 1913, to
         Oscar Wilder Underwood (1862- 1929). Rogers offered the
         earlier letter to Underwood because he was a lineal descendant
         of Joseph Rogers Underwood (1791-1876) and would appreciate
         its historical association.</p>
         <p>Joseph Rogers Underwood (1791-1876) wrote to the Honorable
         W. Thomas, April 2, 1861, concerning his attempts to secure a
         copy of [John Cabell] Breckinridge's (1821-1875) pamphlet
         published in Danville, and his own efforts to preserve the
         Union of the United States and to reclaim those states which
         had seceded. He refers to a speech by Breckinridge before the
         Legislature which supported the preservation of the Union if
         the North would guarantee by constitutional amendment the
         right of future territories to allow the institution of
         slavery within their borders. Underwood also mentioned his
         fears of a bloody conflict which would last "until both
         sections seek repose under the protecting sword of some
         American Napoleon."</p>
