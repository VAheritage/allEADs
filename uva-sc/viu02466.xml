      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of papers and correspondence, ca.
         75 items, ca. [1915?], 1938-1941, and undated, all pertaining
         to the Sadleir-Black Collection of Gothic Fiction in the University of
         Virginia Library Special Collections. This includes a
         signed original typescript, and a carbon and electrostatic
         copy of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">The Introduction to a catalogue of the Sadleir-Black
         Collection of Gothic Novels</title> by Michael Sadleir (22 pages),
         written prior to 1940 (#717); two undated bibliographical
         listings of Gothic books and undated <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Notes on Gothic Romances</title> by Montague Summers of Surrey, England (#717-a &amp;
         -b); <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">The Castle Spectre,</title> a fifty-seven page bound
         mimeographed typescript adapted from the original by Matthew
         Gregory Lewis written in 1797, [ca. 1915], and used as the
         prompt copy by the stage manager and possibly as an actor's
         copy by the leading actress (#717-d); about fifty undated
         brief bibliographic descriptions and notes concerning book
         sales on index cards, printed sources, and note paper
         (#717-e); business and calling cards of Mrs. M.T.H. Sadleir
         (#717-e); and an undated black bound notebook, which Sadleir
         in a letter, May 19, 1938, describes as "an index and register
         made some years ago of Gothic Romance writers and of other
         various books. It is 
         <emph render="underline">not</emph> a catalogue of your
         collection, but may I think be helpful as showing what other
         works were written by the authors there represented, and in
         which directions the collection can, with good fortune, be
         extended" (#717-e).</p>
      <p>There are four letters from Michael Sadleir to Robert K.
         Black (#717-b,-c), all in May 1938, discussing the details of
         the packing and shipping of the Sadleir Gothic books to their
         new owner, Robert Blackadlier also mentions the biography of
         [Matthew Gregory ?] Lewis (1775-1818) by Phipps and discusses
         Sir Walter Scott's comments in the preface 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Castle of Otranto</title>by Horace
         Walpole which were similar to Scott's essay in the Ballantyne
         series (1938 May 14).</p>
      <p>There are seven letters from Montague Summers (1880-1948)
         to Robert K. Black (#717-a), 1939-1941, concerning the
         Sadleir-Black Book Collection. In the earliest letter, Summers
         mentions his work 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Gothic Bibliography,</title><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Gothic Achievement,</title> and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Gothic Quest,</title> Black's offer
         to allow him to see a copy of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Hero,</title> and the controversy
         over the authorship of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Church of St. Siffrid</title> (1939
         Sep 27).</p>
      <p>He also shares his nervousness about the publication of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Gothic Bibliography,</title> the title
         of which he calls a misnomer since it contains all sorts of
         bibliographical information useful to students and scholars
         but "my book will have to go forth - with all its faults";
         believes 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Hero</title> was written by the
         sister of Matthew Gregory Lewis, the subject of another book
         by Summers; and mentions other Gothic writers for which he is
         doing a bibliography (1940 April 16).</p>
      <p>Summer expresses his thanks for all of Black's help and
         reveals his surprise, "It is extraordinary how excessively
         rare these Gothic romances are - the explanation is, I
         suppose, that when this vogue ceased they were thrown out of
         the circulating libraries as lumber and destroyed" (1940 May
         13).</p>
      <p>In another letter, he thanks Black for loaning him the card
         index and two books, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Tale of Mystery, or,
         Celina</title> and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Hero,</title> for taking notes and
         wishes that his publisher would have supported his
         bibliography as well as the Bibliographical Society and the
         Oxford University Press had served Miss Blakey. Summers
         complains that his publisher hurried the completion of his
         bibliography due to the times of disorder and crises of the
         war. He also writes of the changes in literature, "Forty years
         ago in England many old- fashioned people were quite familiar
         with and understood an allusion to 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Mysteries of Udolpho</title> while
         in old-fashioned households 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Monk</title> was still a banned
         book. The change in recent years - since 1905 say - has been
         far greater than was the change between 1830 and 1900. In very
         many ways that is to be understood. I could tell you
         delightful stories of the traditions of England before 1900.
         No unmarried lady allowed to read 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Tom Jones.</title> No unmarried lady
         unless of fairly mature age would dream of hearing 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">La Traviata.</title> Elderly people
         still speaking of Shelley and Byron as rather shocking poets.
         It was really very charming" (1940 Jun 10).</p>
      <p>Summers congratulates Black on owning such a wonderful
         collection and writes about his own bibliography, "I am
         beginning to wish that I had not cast my net quite so wide in
         my bibliography. I have recorded some writers and included
         some books for no better reason perhaps than that in times
         past when I have sought for information upon such a one or
         such a romance I could find nothing until I had searched
         through half-a- dozen volumes and with difficulty pieced
         together the very bare statements of as many forgotten
         biographies" (1940 Jun 15).</p>
      <p>Summers asks for Black's help in locating copies of books
         by John Frederick Smith (1804-1890) whose romances were
         published in book form in New York, especially a copy of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Fred Arden; or, The Jesuit's Revenge</title> and
         discusses other Gothic writers (1940 Jul 22 &amp; Nov 1). The
         last letter apparently accompanied a copy of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Gothic Bibliography</title> sent to
         Black by Montague Summers (1941 Jan 20).</p>
