                  goes she surrounds herself with the same Chinese
                  embroideries and books and delicious tea and personal
                  charm and a troup of original sons and daughters, and
                  calls it a home. How foolish of her!" He also
                  mentions meeting a friend of hers, Fleischner, the
                  new French master; hearing Billy Phelps preach Sunday
                  with four references to Browning and three to Ibsen;
                  refers to his "eternal theme corrections" as a
                  teacher; and urges her to enjoy a long convalescence
                  by reading lengthy works such as the letters of
                  Madame de Sevigne or the novels of Richardson]</p>

                  aristocracies (not after all a hard thing to explain)
                  instead of about the sweet noble lives of republics
                  and self-governing villages." Thornton also writes
                  out a few bars of music and refers to hearing [Fritz
                  ?] Kreisler (1875-1962) play several musical pieces
