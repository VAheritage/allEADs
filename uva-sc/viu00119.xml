      <p>This material, 1853-1991, of ca. 220 items, concerns the 
         <famname>Graham</famname>, 
         <famname>Sanders</famname>, and 
         <famname>Tate</famname>families of 
         <geogname>Wythe County, Virginia</geogname>, and includes
         correspondence, financial and legal papers, genealogical and
         historical information.</p>
      <p>The correspondence is chiefly of 
         <persname>Nannie Montgomery (Tate)</persname>(Feb. 8,
         1843-Jan. 30, 1923) and 
         <persname>David Peirce Graham</persname>(Oct. 24, 1838-Nov. 5,
         1898) and their immediate family, including two of her
         brothers, 
         <persname>James Graham Tate</persname>(Dec. 14, 1840-Aug. 25,
         1864) and 
         <persname>William Hanson Tate</persname>(Sep. 9, 1837-May 15,
         1864), and the couple's children, 
         <persname>David Graham</persname>(Feb. 21, 1872-July 14, 1942)
         and 
         <persname>William Tate Graham</persname>(July 30, 1873-Dec.
         13, 1953). There are letters written to two other children: 
         <persname>Elizabeth Graham</persname>(Aug. 6, 1870-Mar. 23,
         1956), from her parents; and 
         <persname>Catherine Friel Graham</persname>(June 1, 1880-Oct.
         13, 1964), from her brother, David.</p>
      <p>Among the miscellaneous correspondence of the 
         <famname>Graham</famname>, 
         <famname>Sanders</famname>, and 
         <famname>Tate</famname>families, are: a letter, August 2[6],
         1864, from 
         <persname>George M. Hanson</persname>to [ 
         <persname>Charles Campbell Tate</persname>] informing him of

         <persname>James Graham Tate</persname>] near 
         <geogname>Shepherdstown</geogname>; a letter, April 8, 1916,
         from

         sister-in-law, 
         <persname>Nannie Graham</persname>, concerning teaching at the
         <corpname>Cedar Run School</corpname>; and, a letter
         (electrostatic copy), July 23, 1921, from 
         <persname>J. T. Trolingen</persname>, to 
         <persname>Curran F. Sanders</persname>, concerning the capture
         of his father, 
         <persname>A. T. Sanders</persname>, at

      <p>Letters from David Graham, of 
         <geogname>Roanoke, Virginia</geogname>, to his family are
         concerned with news of family and friends, personal matters,
         the local Sunday School and other religious activities, and
         life in 
         <geogname>Roanoke</geogname>, and are full of descriptive
         phrases, witticisms, and humorous anecdotes. The first group
         of his letters are addressed chiefly to his sister, probably
         Elizabeth. A December 17, 1899 letter refers to the trial in 
         <geogname>Wytheville</geogname>of the Commonwealth of Virginia
         vs. 
         <persname>H. G. Wadley</persname>, which had been called for
         trial on the eleventh. [According to the Richmond Times,
         December 12, 1899, there were forty-three counts against
         Wadley, charging him with the embezzlement of $196,000 of the
         assets of the 
         <corpname>Wytheville Banking and Insurance Company</corpname>.
         ] There is an interesting (incomplete) letter, December 28,

         <geogname>La Jolla, [California]</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Mexico</geogname>, and their inhabitants, and
         references to life in 
         <geogname>San Diego</geogname>with Margaret, Elizabeth, and

         <persname>Beverly Tucker Lacy</persname>, relates life in

         <persname>Carter Glass</persname>; and, a January 11, 1937
         letter refers to 
         <persname>Henry McIlwaine</persname>at the 
         <corpname>Virginia State Library</corpname>and the suicide of
         a 
         <persname>Thomas Sexton</persname>. An incomplete letter,
         1923, discusses a divorce and custody case with 
         <persname>Clifton A. Woodrum</persname>as the attorney for the
         husband, and includes a humorous anecdote about Woodrum's
         actions in court. Letters to his sister, 
         <persname>Catherine Friel Graham</persname>, refer to life in 
         <geogname>Roanoke</geogname>, social visitation, a musical

         1903, from 
         <geogname>Port Antonio, Jamaica</geogname>, describes the
         beauty of 
         <geogname>Jamaica</geogname>. Graham mentions a variety of

         days to the encampment, located between 
         <geogname>Gordonsville</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Orange Court House</geogname>, and mentions word of
         enemy locations (near 
         <geogname>Brandy Station</geogname>and in the 
         <geogname>Kanawha Valley</geogname>). An October 17, 1863
         letter from
