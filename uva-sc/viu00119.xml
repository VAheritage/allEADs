      <p>This material, 1853-1991, of ca. 220 items, concerns the 
         <famname>Graham</famname>, 
         <famname>Sanders</famname>, and 
         <famname>Tate</famname>families of 
         <geogname>Wythe County, Virginia</geogname>, and includes
         correspondence, financial and legal papers, genealogical and
         historical information.</p>
      <p>The correspondence is chiefly of 
         <persname>Nannie Montgomery (Tate)</persname>(Feb. 8,
         1843-Jan. 30, 1923) and 
         <persname>David Peirce Graham</persname>(Oct. 24, 1838-Nov. 5,
         1898) and their immediate family, including two of her
         brothers, 
         <persname>James Graham Tate</persname>(Dec. 14, 1840-Aug. 25,
         1864) and 
         <persname>William Hanson Tate</persname>(Sep. 9, 1837-May 15,
         1864), and the couple's children, 
         <persname>David Graham</persname>(Feb. 21, 1872-July 14, 1942)
         and 
         <persname>William Tate Graham</persname>(July 30, 1873-Dec.
         13, 1953). There are letters written to two other children: 
         <persname>Elizabeth Graham</persname>(Aug. 6, 1870-Mar. 23,
         1956), from her parents; and 
         <persname>Catherine Friel Graham</persname>(June 1, 1880-Oct.
         13, 1964), from her brother, David.</p>
      <p>Among the miscellaneous correspondence of the 
         <famname>Graham</famname>, 
         <famname>Sanders</famname>, and 
         <famname>Tate</famname>families, are: a letter, August 2[6],
         1864, from 
         <persname>George M. Hanson</persname>to [ 
         <persname>Charles Campbell Tate</persname>] informing him of
         the death of [ 
         <persname>James Graham Tate</persname>] near 
         <geogname>Shepherdstown</geogname>; a letter, April 8, 1916,
         from 
         <persname>Fanny (Mrs. Charles Beverly) Tate</persname>to her
         sister-in-law, 
         <persname>Nannie Graham</persname>, concerning teaching at the
         <corpname>Cedar Run School</corpname>; and, a letter
         (electrostatic copy), July 23, 1921, from 
         <persname>J. T. Trolingen</persname>, to 
         <persname>Curran F. Sanders</persname>, concerning the capture
         of his father, 
         <persname>A. T. Sanders</persname>, at 
         <geogname>Kernstown</geogname>, on March 23, 1862.</p>
      <p>Letters from David Graham, of 
         <geogname>Roanoke, Virginia</geogname>, to his family are
         concerned with news of family and friends, personal matters,
         the local Sunday School and other religious activities, and
         life in 
         <geogname>Roanoke</geogname>, and are full of descriptive
         phrases, witticisms, and humorous anecdotes. The first group
         of his letters are addressed chiefly to his sister, probably
         Elizabeth. A December 17, 1899 letter refers to the trial in 
         <geogname>Wytheville</geogname>of the Commonwealth of Virginia
         vs. 
         <persname>H. G. Wadley</persname>, which had been called for
         trial on the eleventh. [According to the Richmond Times,
         December 12, 1899, there were forty-three counts against
         Wadley, charging him with the embezzlement of $196,000 of the
         assets of the 
         <corpname>Wytheville Banking and Insurance Company</corpname>.
         ] There is an interesting (incomplete) letter, December 28,

         <geogname>La Jolla, [California]</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Mexico</geogname>, and their inhabitants, and
         references to life in 
         <geogname>San Diego</geogname>with Margaret, Elizabeth, and

         <persname>Beverly Tucker Lacy</persname>, relates life in

         anecdote involving 
         <persname>Carter Glass</persname>; and, a January 11, 1937
         letter refers to 
         <persname>Henry McIlwaine</persname>at the 
         <corpname>Virginia State Library</corpname>and the suicide of
         a 
         <persname>Thomas Sexton</persname>. An incomplete letter,
         1923, discusses a divorce and custody case with 
         <persname>Clifton A. Woodrum</persname>as the attorney for the
         husband, and includes a humorous anecdote about Woodrum's
         actions in court. Letters to his sister, 
         <persname>Catherine Friel Graham</persname>, refer to life in 
         <geogname>Roanoke</geogname>, social visitation, a musical

         1903, from 
         <geogname>Port Antonio, Jamaica</geogname>, describes the
         beauty of 
         <geogname>Jamaica</geogname>. Graham mentions a variety of
         topics, including the Twenty Mule Team Borax advertising
         parade (March 30, 1919), Victory Bond speeches (May 11, 1919),

         camp sites, were sent to his sister, Nannie, and his father, 
         <persname>Charles Campbell Tate</persname>. The letters reveal

         <geogname>Max Meadows</geogname>and reveals the location of
         two regiments of

         days to the encampment, located between 
         <geogname>Gordonsville</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Orange Court House</geogname>, and mentions word of
         enemy locations (near 
         <geogname>Brandy Station</geogname>and in the 
         <geogname>Kanawha Valley</geogname>). An October 17, 1863
         letter from 
         <geogname>Abingdon</geogname>gives news of the enemy leaving 
         <geogname>Bristol (Tennessee)</geogname>, destroying railroads
