      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection's two items are a November 1861 Confederate
         army document (with its transmittal envelope) from Confederate
         engineer Captain 
         <persname>Edmund Trowbridge Dana Myers</persname>(1830-?)
         asking a Captain Hicks of the Confederate steamer Northampton
         to transport nineteen Virginia free blacks (listed by name and
         county of residence) from 
         <geogname>Hardy's Bluff, Isle of Wight County</geogname>, to 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>for eventual return to their
         homes by way of the 
         <corpname>Danville Railroad</corpname>[ 
         <corpname>Richmond and Danville Railroad</corpname>]. Most
         likely these free blacks were being evacuated from the area
         due to approaching Federal forces. A Union army expedition of
         November 14-22, 1861 culminated in the occupation of the
         counties of Accomack and Northampton.</p>
      <p>These blacks, ranging in age from nine to seventy-one, were
         conscripted for the construction of military earthworks and
         other defenses at Fort Huger and Hardy's Bluff [variously
         spelled Harden or Hardin]. Nine were residents of 
         <geogname>Charlotte County</geogname>( 
         <geogname>Drakes Branch</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Mossing Ford</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Roanoke Bridge</geogname>), six were residents of 
         <geogname>Farmville, Prince Edward County</geogname>, and four
         were residents of 
         <geogname>South Boston, Halifax County</geogname>. During much
         of the war able-bodied white Southern males volunteered for
         military service but balked at performing manual labor. The
         Confederacy requisitioned slaves and free blacks to perform
         much of the routine manual labor required by its military
         forces. The Confederate Congress authorized the conscription
         of free black military laborers in July 1861 but many were
         drafted by Confederate military officers before the law was
         enacted.</p>
      <p>Nine of these free blacks were enumerated in the 1860
         Virginia census; some apparently were members of the same
         families: 
         <persname>Galatin Brogden</persname>, 13, Charlotte County; 
         <persname>John L. Brogden</persname>, 8, Charlotte County; 
         <persname>Winston H. Brogden</persname>, 24, Charlotte County;
         <persname>Frank Cromwell</persname>, 70, Charlotte County; 
         <persname>[Gabe?] Daniel</persname>, 29, Halifax County; 
         <persname>Simon Daniel</persname>, 44, Halifax County; 
         <persname>John White</persname>, 18, Prince Edward County; 
         <persname>Phillip White</persname>, 39, Prince Edward County; 
         <persname>Hercules White</persname>, 25, Prince Edward
         County.</p>
      <p>The C.S.S. Northampton, built in Baltimore in 1860 and
         purchased by the state of Virginia in 1861 as a James River
         army transport, had a capacity of 800 men and their equipment.
         It was valued at $50,000 in May 1861. In September 1862 it was
         sunk by Confederates as a Drewry's Bluff obstruction on the
         James River to prevent the advance of Union forces.</p>
      <p>Confederate officers identified by name in the document
         include Capt. Hicks of the Northampton, 
         <persname>C. P. Gilman</persname>, Lieutenant 
         <persname>Charles G. Forshey</persname>, chief of engineers,
         and Captain Edmund Trowbridge Dana Myers, engineering officer
         (as of November 25, 1861). Forshey and Myers were members of
         the staff of Major General John B. Magruder (1807-1871), an
         early proponent of slave military labor. The envelope is
         addressed to Lieutenant Colonel Fletcher Harris Archer
         (1817-1902), a 1841 University of Virginia law graduate,
         veteran of the Mexican War, and postwar mayor of Petersburg,
         Virginia. Fletcher commanded the 5th Battalion of Virginia
         Volunteers, which served as an artillery unit at Harden's
         Bluff on the James River, from October 1861 to May 1862.</p>
