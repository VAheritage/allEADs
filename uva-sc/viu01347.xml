      <p>Benjamin Harrison (August 20, 1787 - January 30, 1842) was
         born at "Berkeley," Charles City County. He was the son of
         Col. Benjamin Harrison (1755-1799) and Anna Mercer, and the
         grandson of Benjamin Harrison (ca. 1726-1791) and Elizabeth
         Bassett. He married first Lucy Nelson, daughter of Col.
         William and Abigail (Byrd) Nelson of Hanover County, Virginia.
         They had one daughter, Mary Willing Harrison (1812-1876), who
         married Francie Howe McGuire, son of William and Mary (Little)
         McGuire. Benjamin Harrison married second Mary Willing Page,
         daughter of John and Maria H. (Byrd) Page of "Pagebrook,"
         Clarke County, Virginia. They had two children: Henry
         Harrison, who was born at "Berkeley" on October 14, 1821, and
         died at "Huntington," Boyce, Clarke County, Virginia; and,
         Benjamin Harrison, who was born in 1824, and resided at
         "Millwood," Clarke County, Virginia.</p>
      <p>John Minge (September 10, 1796 - January 23, 1871) was the
         son of John Minge and Sarah Harrison (d. February 27, 1812),
         the youngest daughter of Benjamin Harrison (ca. 1726-1791) and
         Elizabeth Bassett and sister of William Henry Harrison
         (1773-1841), president of the United States. The elder John
         Minge married second the widow of W. H. Lightfoot of "Sandy
         Point," Charles City County, Virginia. John Minge, M. D.,
         married Mary Griffin Adams (d. June 24, 1869) in Richmond,
         Virginia on March 9, 1820. They had several children,
         including Anna Mercer Minge (January 19, 1809-June 5, 1863),
         who married David Dunlop of Beith, Ayrshire, Scotland.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This ledger includes accounts and memoranda for Berkeley
         Fishery, 1839-1845; [Berkeley Plantation farm workers],
         1876-1877; and accounts for the sale of corn, 1862, in Charles
         City County, Virginia.</p>
      <p>The records for Berkeley Fishery contain a variety of
         entries including: paid accounts, monies owed, cash received
         at the landing [Harrison's Landing], advances for workers,
         workers used for the day, absentee workers, persons paid for
         work or services, comments on the weather and tides, records
         of hauls and fish caught and sold, and trips made to Richmond
         and Petersburg. The ledger appears to have been kept by both
         Benjamin Harrison and John Minge, M.D. There are at least two
         statements with signatures (May 6, 1840 and April 13, 1841) by
         Benjamin Harrison. A memorandum for April 12, 1841 mentions a
         daughter Anna Mercer [daughter of John Minge?].</p>
      <p>The Fishery records begin March 1839 until August 1841,
         continue from March 1842 until May 1843, again from March
         until May 1843, and from January until July 1845. Entries for
         March 1843 contain notes on the hands regularly engaged to
         fish the entire season and memorandum re Mr. Harrison's
         expense in the building of two capstans and repairing of the
         reel. Relating to women are entries, April - May 1843, for a
         Richmond woman, Clarissa Holmes, and a Mrs. Poindexter.
         Following the entry for May 17, 1843 are notes for reference
         concerning the purchase of two carts at the beginning of each
         season for hauling fish to Richmond, Virginia every night and
         concerning the promise to slaves to be able to fish all
         season, with a note on the unworthiness of free hands with
         certain exceptions.</p>
      <p>The entry for April 12, 1841 contains a memorandum on a
         visit to Washington, D. C. following the death of the writer's
         [John Minge, M. D.?] uncle, William Henry Harrison
         (1773-1841), president of the United States: "On the 10th I
         returned from Washington after an absence of one week in the
         performance of the last melancholy duties to my own venerated
         Uncle Wm. Henry Harrison; inaugurated on the 4th of March last
         President of these U. States and who after one brief month
         resigned his soul into the hands of his blessed Maker &amp;
         Redeemer. My Daughter Anna Mercer has accounted for the
         following money received from the Fishery during my
         absence."</p>
      <p>There are also harvest records, June - July 1843 and July
         1844, keeping records of payment to hirelings and on thrashing
         wheat. Judge [Philip Norborne] Nicholas (1775-1849) is
         mentioned. There is also an account, October - December n.y.,
         for barrels of meal, corn, and hominy. There are accounts,
         September 1862 - March 1863, for corn, chiefly with R. E.
         Thornton; and an account, October 1862, for corn delivered for
         the government.</p>
      <p>The farm accounts, 1876-1877, are written over the pages
         containing the Berkeley Fishery records. Given names or
         complete names are listed at the top of each page, including
         the last names Parker, Wallace, Robinson, Washington, Ford,
         Powell, Holt, Williams, Brown, Gilliam, Adams, Chavas, Milby,
         and Artis. A wide variety of items are listed in these
         accounts including food, clothing, sewing material, household
         items, agriculture, and livestock. There is the signature
         Henry H. Harrison at the bottom of the first full page of the
         ledger. This could be Henry Huntington Harrison (October 14,
         1821 - October 4, 1887), who was born at "Berkeley" and lived
         at "Huntington," Clarke County, Virginia, and married Frances
         Tabb Burwell (March 5, 1827 - August 6, 1897), daughter of
         George H. Burwell, of "Carter Hall," Clarke County, Virginia.
         This Henry Harrison had been private secretary to his
         great-uncle William Henry Harrison, president of the United
         States.</p>
