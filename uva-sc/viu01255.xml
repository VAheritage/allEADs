      <p>According to Lee A. Wallace, Jr., 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">5th Virginia
         Infantry,</title>(Lynchburg: H. E. Howard, 1988, page 99), and
         internal evidence in the collection, William Francis Brand was
         born August 31, 1840, in Augusta County, Virginia. By
         occupation he was a miller and enlisted (in Greenville) as a
         private in the Confederate Army, Company E, 5th Virginia
         Infantry, on April 18, 1861. He enlisted for the duration of
         the war, and during his military service was stationed or saw
         combat at Haynesville (July 2, 1861); First Manassas [First
         Bull Run] (July 21, 1861); furloughed because of the
         amputation of his big toe, March 16, 1863; Kernstown (March
         23, 1862; his brother Tom was killed); Front Royal (May 23,
         1862); McDowell (May 8, 1862); Winchester (May 25, 1862); Port
         Republic (June 9, 1862; struck in the hand by bouncing

         the war Brand was a farmer and member Stonewall Jackson Camp
         of the United Confederate Veterans; he died in Lexington on

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Most of his letters, 1861-1867, are to his future wife
         Amanda C. Armentrout and accounts of camp life and members of
         his regiment and their families, local, state, and national
         events. Brand's letters sometimes reflect an often troubled
         relationship between the couple as they regularly accuse or
         apologize for supposed unfaithfulness, end and renew their
         relationship, pledge undying love and devotion to each other,
         set and postpone the date of their wedding (January 21, 1864,
         December 12, 1865, January 9, 1866, May 24, 1866, July 21,
         1866). He also admits to a swearing problem and promises her
         that he will stop (April 5, 1866). He wrote his letters from a
         variety of Virginia cities, towns, counties and military camps
         including Brandy Station, Caroline County, Centreville,
         Charles Town, Essex County, Greenville, Harpers Ferry,
         Lexington, Liberty Mills, Madison County, Martinsburg, Morgan
         County, Nelson County, Orange County, Petersburg, Rockbridge
         County, and Winchester. Brand discusses illegal and underage
         voting by members of his regiment for secession (May 25,
         1861); the battle of [First] Kernstown (April 6, 1862); the
         battle of [First] Winchester (May 29, 1862); his unhappy stay
         at a Nelson County hospital (August 29, 1862); thanks
         Armentrout for sending cheese (February 6, 1863); description
         of an operation on his big toe (May 23, 1863); using pokeroot
         ink to write his letters (October 11, 1863); a massive
         snowball fight between two groups of Confederate troops (March
         24, 1864); the battles of Spotsylvania (May 16, 1864),
         Fisher's Hill (September 22, 1864), Cedar Creek (October 28,
         1864), and Bentonville, North Carolina (March 22, 1865); and
         encountering barefooted Valley girls "awkward in their
         manners" (August 19, 1864).</p>
      <p>Brand mentions or quotes prominent civilians and military
         personages in his letters including: Jefferson Davis
         [1808-1889], Jubal Early [1816-1894], Elmer Ellsworth
         [1837-1861], Richard Ewell [1817-1872], Richard Brooke Garnett
         [1817-1863], Joseph E. Johnston [1807-1891], Abraham Lincoln
         [1809-1865], James A. Longstreet [1821-1904], Prince Napoleon
         [Prince Napoléon-Jérôme,
         1822-1891, born Napoléon-Joseph-Charles-Paul
         Bonaparte], John Pope [1822-1892], Robert Emmett Rodes
         [1829-1864], Jeb Stuart [1833-1864], James Alexander Walker
         [1832-1901], and Charles S. Winder [1829-1862]. Several
         identified members of various Confederate regiments and mutual
         friends and families are also mentioned or discussed by name.
         Brand's wartime letters are listed and described at the end of
         this guide.</p>
      <p>Amanda C. "Kate" Armentrout, a resident of Greenville,
         Augusta County, and Brand's (postwar) wife was born on
         September 1 but the year is unknown (see her letter of
         September 1, 1867). There are several antebellum letters from
         her former schoolmate John P. Lightner [1841?-1862] who
         enlisted in Company I, 4th Virginia Infantry, during June 1861
         and died of typhoid fever in February 1862 [James I.
         Roberston, 4th Virginia Infantry, second edition (Lynchburg,
         1982), page 61]. According to the donor's genealogical notes
         "Family Record," Lightner later married Anne, Amanda's sister.
         Also present is a September 14, 1857, letter from John's
         brother George Pilson Lightner [1839-1925], later a member of
         the 52nd Virginia Infantry. John and George Lightner's letters
         describe student life at Brownsburg Academy and the Christian
         Creek School (both in Rockbridge County) and Washington
         College [later Washington and Lee University], Lexington,
         during 1856-1861. John describes war preparations in Lexington
         (May 18, 1861) and a flag presentation and speech by Governor
         John Letcher [1813-1884] and Company I's assignment as the
         headquarters guard for General Gustavus Woodson Smith
         [1822-1896] (October 31, 1861). William F. Brand mentions John
         Lightner in a June 23, 1861, letter. Lightner's letters are
         listed and described at the end of this guide.</p>
      <p>Amanda Armentrout's 1859-1874 correspondents include
         various relatives and friends. A January 12, 1861, letter
         describes a taffy pull; there are also several letters from
         Robert B. Spillman, apparently a Confederate officer stationed
         at Chimborazo Hospital, Richmond, and later a Fredericksburg
         and Westmoreland County resident (December 28, 1864, January
         12 and 29 and October 15, 1865, October 13, 1866). She
         addresses few of her letters to future husband William Francis
         Brand (whom she often addresses as "Willie): June 5, 1864,
         July 6, 23, 29, and August 17, 1866 (which includes a poem);
         she first addresses him as husband in her October 7, 1866,
         letter. Selected Armentrout letters are listed and described
         at the end of this guide.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous Brand family letters (1863, 1866-1867, 1873)
         include letters of William Francis Brand's brother Charles
         David Brand urging him to marry Armanda Armentrout (August 12
         and November 25, 1866), an August 12, 1866, letter in which
         Charles discusses "a grand memorial" held at the Buckingham
         Female Institute [August 1, 1866] and attended by 500 persons
         "about two-thirds of that number lovely fair sex," and, a
         Confederate soldier's description of his wounding and capture
         at the battle of Gettysburg, November 11, 1863. A separate
         folder of miscellaneous materials and genealogical notes
         contains a 1959 news article about William and Amanda Brand
         ("Letters from Civil War Soldier Describe His Life As Member
         of Confederate Army," Waynesboro News-Virginian), a ca.
         1925-1930 Standing Liberty Type Quarter Dollar, notes on the
         Brand letters by Colonel S. L. Denison, chairman, Waynesboro
         Civil War Centennial Committee, and a 1932 typescript excerpt
         from the minutes of Tinkling Spring Church regarding the death
         of Brand as its senior elder.</p>
