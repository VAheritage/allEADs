      <p>Mrs. Chamberlain conveys news of her husband, relayed to
         her by two men from his regiment who escaped and travelled 120
         miles to Union lines with the aid of local blacks. She
         mentions the poor food in prision, the Confederates' failure
         to distribute caused by a Federal raid, and the local
         enlistment being high enough to make the draft
         unnecessary.</p>

      <p>Near Melmore, Feb 29th 
         <abbr expan="1864">[18]64</abbr><lb/><lb/><lb/>Dear Miss Casey, 
         <lb/><lb/>Your kind and most welcome letter was duly received some
         time since. I was pleased to hear of your health being good as
         usual, and glad to learn that Allie &amp; Emma are pleased
         with their school. I often think of them and wonder how they
         enjoy themselves away from home. If I thought I could interest
         them I would write to them, but I fear a letter of mine would
         appear dull and prosy to their young minds. 
         <lb/></p>
      <p>The last letter I received from Mr. Chamberlin was written
         the 27th of Jan. Last Friday I visited Capt. Caldwell of the
         123rd Reg[imen]t. His family reside in Crawford Co. near
         Benton, about six miles from here. Capt. Caldwell &amp; Lieut.
         Williams were the only ones from that Reg[imen]t that made
         their escape. They came together, were eight days and nine
         nights on the way. The distances they traveled was about 120
         miles. They were not met by Union men as some were, but came
         unattended to the Federal line. They met with negroes who gave
         them food, and information how to avoid the Rebel Pickets.
         They found Richmond very strongly fortified much more so than
         they supposed it would be. Mr. Caldwell's health has not been
         very good since his imprisonment, he is now afflicted with the
         scurvy, and has been for some time, wading through mud and
         water did not have a very beneficial affect upon him. He does
         not expect to be able to join the 
         <abbr expan="regiment">Reg[imen]t</abbr>for six or eight
         weeks. He left Mr. Chamberlin well, says he has never been
         sick since he went there. He had never conversed with him on
         the escape question, as it was kept very secret, but thinks he
         knew it. A number were in favor of waiting a few weeks until
         the excitement caused by Butler's attempted raid had ceased,
         as they knew the pickets were more numerous, and the forces
         larger than they had been, and preferred death in prison to
         being recaptured by the enemy. There were when Mr. C_ left,
         three cargoes of boxes at Richmond that had never been
         distributed by the Rebels. They have not been furnished wheat
         bread for some time, and the corn bread that is issued they
         grate over, and make cakes of it themselves. If they eat it as
         it is furnished it makes them sick. They get meat once a week
         generally, sometimes once in two weeks. Well, I fear I have
         wearied you with the one subject most important to me, but I
         trust you will excuse me. How is your "Aid Society" prospering
         now? You ask if I am not coming to Carey this winter, as this
         is the last day of winter I can surely answer correctly. I
         don't know when I will visit your place. I do not visit much,
         but would like to see you and some other friends there. A
         number of young men in this neighborhood have enlisted, and I
         doubt very much whether the 
         <emph render="underline">Draft</emph>will go off at present.
         Remember me kindly to your parents, and believe me as ever 
         <lb/><lb/>Your friend 
         <lb/><lb/>M. Chamberlin</p>
