      <p>This collection consists of items, 1945-1986, n.d.,
         pertaining to the John Powell Foundation and its goal to
         encourage and promote performances of John Powell's
         compositions. The correspondence and papers of the Foundation
         refer to performances and projects of modern composers and
         other musicians involving the compositions of John Powell;
         funding and contributions to music projects; and, related
         topics. Included are correspondence, programs, rosters, legal
         papers, newspaper clippings, and miscellaneous papers.</p>

         Trigg, Thomas Brockman (1922- ), the Leschetizky Association,
         Edgar Schenkman, and Steptoe &amp; Johnson, attorneys. The
         publication of Powell's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sonata Teutonica</title>is among the
         topics of discussion. Correspondents, 1975-1976, include Roy
         Hamlin Johnson, Carter Harman of Composers Recordings, Inc.,
         and Vladimir Sokoloff. Topics of discussion include Johnson's
         proposal for a record of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sonata Teutonica</title>and the

         release of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sonata Teutonica</title>as performed by
         pianist Roy Hamlin Johnson, and Langstaff's comments on Sonata
         Teutonica and his request to purchase copies of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Five Virginia Folk Songs</title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Childrens' Songs</title>. From
         1977-1981, there is correspondence with Jean M. Bonin, Music
         Librarian, and Edmund Berkeley, Jr., Curator of Manuscripts,
         at the University of Virginia concerning the John Powell
         Collection, which was given to the University Library by the
         John Powell Foundation. As a pianist often sponsored and
         supported by the Foundation, Roy Hamlin Johnson (1929- ) is a
         prominent correspondent throughout the papers. During
         1978-1979, the Norfolk Society of Arts corresponds about
         Florence Richardson Robertson's recital at the Chrysler Museum
         in April 1978. Other topics of interest include: Roy Hamlin

         Press' publication of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sonata Teutonica</title>; and,
         Johnson's progress on his projects and updates on
         performances. There are also letters from John Diercks (1927-
         ) concerning Dennis McWater's photograph of Wayman Adams'
         painting of John Powell. Correspondents, 1980, include Robert
         W. Kirkpatrick, Fernando Laires (1925- ), and Richard Bales
         (1915- ), conductor of the National Gallery Orchestra. Topics

         SonataTeutonica; tape recordings of John Powell given to the
         University of Virginia Library by the John Powell Foundation;
         the establishment of a John Powell Prize at the University of
         Maryland; and the premiere of Powell's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Symphony in A</title>, as edited by Roy
         Hamlin Johnson. In 1981, the Foundation makes a grant to the
         National Gallery of Art for the premiere of Powell's Symphony
         in A as edited by Johnson. Correspondents, 1981, include
         Richard Bales, Ernest C. Mead, Jr., and David Edward Collins
         (1949- ). Mead criticizes Johnson's redaction of Sonata
         Teutonica and Collins writes about the prospect of recording
         John Powell's

         Hamlin Johnson's projects, such as the printed edition of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sonata Teutonica</title>and work on 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sonate Psychologique</title>.
