      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Leonidas Rosser (1815-1892), a Methodist minister born at
         Petersburg, Virginia, transferred to the Virginia Conference
         in 1840, and served as chaplain to the University of Virginia
         in 1842-1843, and as editor of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Richmond Christian Advocate</title>,
         1858-1860.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent>
      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers contain ca. 115 items, ca. 1849-1876, and
         undated, and include biographical information concerning
         Rosser, manuscript notes, sermon anecdotes, correspondence, a
         speech, newsclippings, and a carte- de-viste of Leonidas
         Rosser.</p>
      <p>The correspondence consists of four items: a printed letter
         circulated to raise money to support the Southern Methodist
         Church in Alexandria, Virginia, which lost all of its
         possessions in a law suit when it decided to withdraw from the
         Baltimore Conference and join the Virginia Conference in 1849
         (1851 January 20); two drafts of a letter from Rosser to
         Bishop Joshua Soule requesting his permission to use his
         statements concerning Rosser's book on baptism in a future
         edition of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Baptism: its nature, obligation, mode,
         subjects, and benefits</title>(1854 May 13); and a note from
         Thomas Johnson about missing Rosser during his visit (1859
         July 2).</p>
      <p>Newsclippings present in the collection refer to Rosser's
         revival preaching at various locations, criticisms concerning
         his books, notices of the publication of his books on
         religious topics, and doctrinal controversies.</p>
      <p>Notes on doctrine discuss baptism, the infallibility of the
         pope, methodism, ministerial advice to new ministers, and a
         biographical note about William H. Wells (1822- ?). Notes on
         church government include the reunion of North and South
         Methodist Episcopal Church, Itineracy, new rules for the
         Quarterly Conference, lay representation, and the balloting
         for the election of bishops (1854). Notes on class meetings
         later were published in book form, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Class meetings: embracing their origin,
         nature, obligation, and benefits</title>in 1855. Notes on
         slavery and Methodism discuss the break between the North and
         South Methodist Episcopal Church, and includes "Loyalty of
         Southern Methodism" which was never published.</p>
      <p>Also included in this collection is a speech entitled, "The
         uncontrollable necessity and constitutionality of the
         separation of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, in 1844"
         (1857 January 12), delivered in Salem, Virginia.</p>
      <p>Although Rosser did serve as a chaplain to the University
         of Virginia, in 1842-1843, none of these papers appear to
         pertain to that period of his ministry.</p>
