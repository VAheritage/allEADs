      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of five letters, 1833-1843, from
         Philip and Sally Lybrook of Giles County, Virginia, to their
         brother, Henley C. Lybrook, Cassopolis, Cass County, Michigan
         Territory. Ten Lybrook brothers and sisters are known from the
         letters and include: John C. Lybrook, Catharine Burke, Henley
         C. Lybrook, Evalina Lumpkins, Sarah (Sally) Lybrook, Elizabeth
         (Betsy) Lybrook Atkins, Isaac Lybrook, George Lybrook, Nancy
         Lybrook, and Philip Lybrook.</p>
      <p>Sally Lybrook, June 21, 1833, expresses thankfulness that
         her brother has escaped the recent Indian wars unharmed;
         describes their mother's illness during the last winter and
         spring, the sickness of Aunt Peggy Hall, and the scarlet fever
         afflicting her brother Philip's family; mentions her father's
         sale of the large field adjoining the plantation of David
         Williams to Williams and his payment of several debts, the
         sale of Captain G. Cale's farm to Philip and Cale's plans to
         move from Giles County and the wedding of Olivia Johnston;
         hopes that he will arrive home by summer; and a mention of the
         black children working the farm by themselves.</p>
      <p>A second letter from Sally Lybrook, January 21, 1834, to
         Henley, pleads with Henley to return to the more healthful
         climate of Virginia; mentions a letter from a brother, John C.
         Lybrook in Carroll County and his difficulty with crop
         failure, and Captain Hale's purchase of a plantation in St.
         Joseph country; describes a meteor shower; mentions two new
         stores in Giles County belonging to Peterman Crawford and John
         Peck; and again mentions that "the black children work the
         farm by themselves and have raised a tolerable good crop this
         last season and they are fine children."</p>
      <p>In a letter from Philip Lybrook, March 23, 1838, to Henley,
         he writes in great detail about the sale of his father's
         estate on January 12, 1838, in which all the property was sold
         "Negroes land and all" for about $ 2800, and about a piece of
         land sold by his father earlier to pay a debt to the estate of
         Colonel George Snidow who had held a deed of trust on a slave
         boy named Jim and relates the circumstances of how his father
         contracted the debt; describes the family problems over the
         courtship and marriage of Betsy and Joseph Atkins following
         his father's death, with Sally coming to live with him and his
         family; supposes that Nancy was not mentioned in the will
         because when she left home, she took with her a slave called
         Sampson and the little gray mare; mentions that the slave Jim
         brought $900 in the sale; and describes the legal difficulties
         of [Keith ?] in Greenbrier County.</p>
      <p>Philip Lybrook, in a second letter, April 1, 1840, attempts
         to make arrangements to get Henley's share of his father's
         estate to him safely; relates the contents of his father's
         will and the difficulties in settling the estate; refers to
         sale of the slaves, "the Negroes sold much higher than he [his
         father] rated them before his death"; and asks for help in
         purchasing a tombstone for his father as "it has become
         customary to have them in this country."</p>
      <p>In a third letter, [Philip ?] Lybrook, February 17, 1843,
         describes the ravages of [typhoid fever ?] upon his family,
         "my white family has all been down with it with the exception
         of Eliza and Eleanor - it is now among my black family some
         has recovered there is but two of the little boys that is any
         ways dangerous and I think they are on the mend - the disease
         has been in my house near six months"; mentions other cases of
         the disease in the neighborhood, some fatal, hard financial
         times, Sally's poor health and desperate condition, and rumors
         of the mistreatment of Betsy Lybrook Atkins by her husband
         Joseph.</p>
