        <head>Acquisition Information</head>
        <p>Many of the papers in this archive came from General
            Watson's office in the White House, and were turned over to
            Mrs. Watson after her husband's death. Added to these were
            his personal papers; the archive was moved to "Kenwood,"
            the Watson's home near Charlottesville, Virginia, where it
            remained until Mrs. Watson's death in December 1971. In her
            will, Mrs. Watson bequested the entire contents of the
            files to the University of Virginia, and the files were
            delivered to the Library in the spring of 1972.</p>

      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Edwin Martin Watson was born in Eufala, Alabama, 10
         December 1883, but moved while very young to Martinsville,
         Virginia where he grew up and received his early education. He
         received an appointment to the United States Military Academy
         and graduated in the Class of 1908. Commissioned a second
         lieutenant in the infantry he saw service in various posts in
         the United States and in the Phillipine Islands. After a tour
         as military aide to President Woodrow Wilson, Captain Watson
         transferred to the artillery. He served with distinction in
         the A.E.F. in France, winning a number of combat decorations.
         During the Versailles negotiations he served as junior aide to
         President Wilson, and returned to Washington in that capacity.
         He married Frances Nash, a promising concert pianist, in 1920.
         Two years in France at various French field artillery schools
         followed, and then various tours in U.S. artillery posts. In
         June, 1927, Major Watson graduated from the Command and
         General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, and was ordered to
         the American Embassy in Brussels as Military Attache, serving
         there for four years. Returning to the United States in 1931,
         Watson served with an artillery unit in New York, was promoted
         to lieutenant colonel, and in January, 1933, reported to the
         General Staff in Washington. On June 1, 1933, he was ordered
         as Military Aide to President Roosevelt. By 1939, Watson was a
         brigadier general, and secretary tot eh President; he was
         promoted to Major General on October 1, 1940. He died suddenly
         during the return trip from the Yalta Conference on 20
         February 1945.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection, which fills fifty-one Hollinger storage
         boxes occupying about twenty-one linear feet of shelving,
         consists of the papers of Major General Edwin M. Watson, and
         of his wife, Frances Nash Watson. The material covers the
         period 1900 (1933)-(1945) 1967. Included is a good deal of
         material from General Watson's army career and personal life,
         but the largest portion of the material was produced by his
         service as military aide to President Franklin D. Roosevelt
         from 1933-1939, and subsequently, as secretary to Roosevelt
         until Watson's death in February 1945. Official files of
         various sorts kept by General Watson during this service are
         included. However, as he was a personal friend of President
         Roosevelt, there is much material of an unofficial nature such
         as humorous memoranda, photographs taken on vacation and
         official trips, mementoes, etc. Mrs. Watson's papers fall into
         two groups. The first consists of papers re General Watson's
         death and funeral, letters of condolence, etc., while the
         second is largely made up of an extensive correspondence with
         Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter.</p>

      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>After General Watson's death, Mrs. Watson, and his
         secretary, Mrs. Lillian Dennison, worked with General Watson's
         papers for many months. It is impossible now to determine the
         integrity of the files, or the original organization. But the
         series found when the papers reached the Library were retained
         for two reasons: they are logical, and a card index to the
         files had been prepared which was keyed to this organization.
         Considerable material was received, particularly many of
         General Watson's personal papers and all of Mrs. Watson's,
         which had not been organized at all. In many cases, however,
         some indications of the intent of the original organizers were
         apparent, and these indications have been followed wherever
         possible.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Watson prepared an "Explanation of File" which was
         dated 21 April 1947. Each series is described, and these
         descriptions have been incorporated in the Series-Container
         listing which follows. Through Box 39 the comments on each
         series are those of Mrs. Watson except for material in
         brackets which has been supplied by the compiler of this
         Guide. The description and organization of the material in
         Boxes 40-51, and of the oversize and other material was
         prepared by the compiler.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Watson wrote the following introduction to the papers
         in her "Explanation of File": 
         <lb/><lb/>April 21, 1947 
         <lb/>This is a file of Major General Edwin Martin Watson. 
         <lb/>Some of these documents concern his early life, others
         relate to West Point days and his military career, but most of
         them pertain to his part in President Roosevelt's
         administration-first, as his Military Aide, and later as
         Secretary to the President, while continuing his duties as
         Military Aide. 
         <lb/>These written records indicate the nature and scope of
         General Watson's duties, and are evidence of his influence in
         the President's Life - officially and personally. Much, of
         course, was never put on paper, but something of this can be
         read between the lines of many of the General's remarkable
         memos and letters. 
         <lb/>The arrangement of the papers tell the story of General
         Watson's daily activities - somewhat in the order of events as
         they occurred, as follows.</p>

        <head>Other Finding Aid</head>
        <p>The card index file, which is available upon request,
            consists of about 4,000 cards. There is a card, or a series
            of cards, for every person with whom General Watson
            corresponded and there are many subject cards. There is an
            entry on each correspondent's card for each piece of
            correspondence with its date and a description of the
            content of each letter in a short phrase. The index, as far
            as can be determined, covers the material in Boxes 1
            through 39. It is presumed that this card index was begun
            during General Watson's White House Service to enable him
            to locate any items in his files, but there is no definite
            evidence to support this presumption. The personal papers,
            which were received unorganized, were not included in the
            index, nor were Mrs. Watson's papers.</p>

          <p>Beginning in 1933 and continuing to 1945, these memos

               from the President's other Secretaries; from Mrs.
               Roosevelt or her secretary (Malvina Thompson, formerly
               Mrs. Scheider); from the General's own secretaries, his
               liaison officers with the War Department; and lesser
               members of the White House personnel. These memos and

          <p>The General had an ingenious trick of writing memos
               to himself, starting out "Memo to General Watson" and
               signed "EMW," which served to remind him of any matter
               he wanted brought to his attention. He seldom needed the
               reminder but it was always there in the background, just
               as a check-up.</p>

          <p>These memos, mainly from General Watson, were in

               subjects General Watson thought he might wish or should
               consider. They dealt with matters both high and low -
               from important secret papers to jokes on General Watson;
               included questions asked the President by Senators and
               Congressmen, letters brought to the President's
               attention by Mrs. Roosevelt, etc. 
               <lb/><lb/>Many of these memos are very revealing,
               characteristic of General Watson - and give a good

          <p>These deal with correspondence; requests from the
               President; various jobs he wanted done; politics;
               directives, and so on. Some are formal memos, others
               just a note jotted on top of a letter by the President's
               secretary, at his direction, "Pa, to answer," "Pa, tell
               them I cannot do this."

          <p>These are the "draft" copies of the President's daily

               before and submitted to the President each morning at
               the bedside Conference. 
               <lb/><lb/>The President's handwriting is on most [some] of
               these lists - adding, changing, deleting, sometimes
               writing an entire new schedule, but more often just
               shuffling the hours 5 minutes one way or another. The
               President did this to tease the General - and it became
               quite a game with him.</p>
