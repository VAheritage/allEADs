            <p>This collection was given to the University of Virginia
            Library by the children of William Martin Baker, including
            Margaret C. Baker, Mary Voorhees Baker, Lucinda Baker,
            Elizabeth M. Baker, and George G. Baker on October 10,
            1931.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection consists of the papers and account books of
         the Baker family in Louisa County, Virginia, and Gordonsville,
         Virginia, twenty-one items, ca. 1800-1880. There are two
         letters from William Baker to his sister Margaret written in
         May 21 and June 11, 1864, when Baker evidently was serving
         temporarily under General James Dearing in the 41st Regiment,
         North Carolina Troop, 3rd Cavalry, concerning personal news,
         the campaign around Richmond, and the strategic importance of
         Gordonsville. There is also an undated valentine addressed to
         "Miss Maggie."</p>
         <p>One letter from William Mills, Jr. to his parents, December
         15, 1800, written near Frankfort, Kentucky, describes his
         suffering with ague and fever and his activities in land
         speculation. He also comments on the fortitude of his sister,
         apparently with or near him, and a Mr. Winslow who has been
         very helpful to him in the land business.</p>
         <p>Financial documents include a plat of 190 acres of land,
         located on both sides of Cub Creek, Louisa County, Virginia,
         surveyed by John Edwards for Edward Hallam, April 10, 1812; a
         receipt, from Joel Wolfe to Martin Baker, Jr. , Richmond,
         Virginia, September 6, 18[2]9, for land sold by Samuel Baker;
         and a bond of Elisha Jackson to Cleavers Baker, August 15,
         1839, relating to a lawsuit in Louisa County Court.</p>
         <p>Also present is a small account or memorandum book,
         1811-1821, for blacksmithing, carpentry, shop work, and grain
         transactions, with lumber accounts in other hands for 1852 and
         1866-1880. Two oversize ledgers include the Day Book of Leroy
         Chandler &amp; Company of Aspen Dale, Louisa County, Virginia,
         1817-1819; and an unidentified ledger for 1878-1879.</p>
         <p>There are also eleven oversize certificates of proficiency
         in Latin, Italian, and other subjects, presented by the School
         at Gordonsville, Virginia to William M. Baker and Cleavers
         Baker, 1855-1856.</p>
