      <p>Parker T. Hart was born in Medford, Massachusetts, and
         graduated from Dartmouth College (1933), received a master's
         degree from Harvard in 1935, and studied at the Graduate
         Institute of International Studies in Geneva. In 1952 he also

         thirty-one years, entering government service in 1937 as a
         translator of French with the Department of State and being
         commissioned in the Foreign Service the following year. His
         first foreign posting took him to Vienna, where he witnessed
         the Nazi annexation of Austria and helped Jews fleeing to the
         United States and Palestine. During World War II, Hart served
         in Brazil where he investigated possible Nazi operations.</p>

         opened the first United States consulate in Dhahran, Saudi
         Arabia, serving as consul general from 1949-1951. Other
         positions related to the Middle East include: Consul, Dhahran
         (1945-1946); Service in the Division of Foreign Service
         Planning, Department of State (1947-1949); Director of the

         Mission, Cairo (1955-1958); Minister to Syria during the first
         months of the United Arab Republic (1958); Deputy Assistant
         Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs
         (1958-1961); Ambassador to Saudi Arabia (1961-1965), and
         concurrently Minister to Yemen (1961-1962) and Ambassador to
         Kuwait (1962-1963); Ambassador to Turkey (1965- 1968); and
         Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian
         Affairs (1968- 1969).</p>
      <p>From 1969 until 1973, he was president of the Middle East
         Institute. From 1972 until 1990, Hart worked as a consultant
         with Bechtel Corportation. He is also the author of two books,
