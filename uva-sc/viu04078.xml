      <p>Malcolm Bell, a professor emeritus of classical archaeology at the University of
                Virginia, received a Bachelor's of Art, and a Ph.D (1972) from Princeton University,
                graduating cum laude with a degree in English, and studying classical archaeology.
                As a student, he participated in archaeological field work at Aphrodisias
                (1961-1963) and Morgantina (1967-1968). He received two pre-doctoral
                fellowships (Fulbright 1968-1969) and American Academy in Rome
                (1968-1970). His dissertation was on "The Terracottas Rome and Sicily," which
                was later published as the beginning of a series, "volume 1 Morgantina Studies,"
                (1977) and later he became the co-editor of the series. He was the director of the
                University of Virginia excavations at Sicily where he travelled annually for field
                work at the excavation site of Morgantina, teaching students and colleagues from
                around the world. </p>
      <p>Bell joined the faculty at the University of Virginia in 1971 as an Assistant
                Professor. He was promoted to full professor in 1986. His scholarly career centered
                on colonial Greek archaeology. He also studied western Greek terracottas which led
                to his work on Aegean classicism. He received a National Endowment of the Humanities
                grant for this work in 1977.</p>
      <p>He is a fellow of the American Academy in Rome and has held a Guggenheim Fellowship.
                He served as A. W. Mellon Professor both at the American Academy in Rome
                (1991-1992, 1993-1996) and the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual
                Arts at the National Gallery of Art (1998-2000) He served as editor of
                Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome and has published articles on the Motya
                charioteer, athletic dedications in Sicily, and Greek bronze choreutes in
                Copenhagen. From 2002-2006 he served as Vice President for Professional
                Responsibilities for the Archaeological Institute of America. He has also served as
                advisor to the Minestero dei Beni e le Attivita Cultrali of Italy and oversaw the
                repatriation to Italy of the acrolithic sculptures from Morgantina (2008). He was
                awarded a Citizenship award by the town of Aidone, Sicily in 2008.</p>
      <p>In addition to his archaeological work, and his teaching, he served the University as
                department chairman (1978-1985) and by actively participating in a variety of
                committees concerned with student residential life, playing a major role in the
                establishment of the university's first residential college.</p>

            <p>There are newspaper clippings and correspondence about a controversy
                                in which the Bayly accepted a gift of ceramic pottery from the
                                Turkish Federated State of Kibris. However the Republic of Cyprus
                                claimed that the pottery belonged to them was not owned by the
                                Turkish Federated State. Correspondents include UVA President Frank

                                Arts Library about circulation policies, reduced budget, missing

                                Arts Faculty complained that these issues were affecting critical
                                library functions.</p>
