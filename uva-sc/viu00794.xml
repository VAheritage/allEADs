      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 425 items (1 Hollinger
         box), 1852-1896, and undated, the business and financial
         papers of the former Confederate General 
         <persname>Bradley Tyler Johnson</persname>(1829-1903) of 
         <geogname>Baltimore, Maryland</geogname>, chiefly concerning
         the various financial negotiations and subsequent litigation
         involving his interests in the 
         <corpname>Jordan Mountain Manganese Mining Company</corpname>,
         <geogname>Sussex, Kings County, New Brunswick,
         Canada</geogname>. The business papers contain drafts of
         agreements; a title and partition; a promissory note;
         receipts; cancelled checks; business correspondence; proxies;
         the will of 
         <persname>Maria Tyler [Belt ?]</persname>(1882 Jan 16); and
         drafts of minutes of the 
         <corpname>Jordan Mountain Manganese Mining
         Company</corpname>stockholders meetings. Other papers include:
         a bill of complaint of 
         <persname>Bradley T. Johnson</persname>vs. 
         <persname>Walter H. Harrison</persname>concerning Harrison's
         fraudulent selling of stock in the 
         <corpname>Jordan Mountain Mining Company</corpname>,
         1891-1892; insurance papers and receipts arranged
         alphabetically within the folder by the name of the insurance
         company; reports and prospectes on the 
         <corpname>Jordan Mountain Manganese Mines</corpname>;
         telegrams; and a "sketch of 
         <persname>Frederick W. Stockton</persname>'s Manganese Mine,
         Kings County, New Brunswick."</p>
      <p>After the Civil War, Johnson practiced law in 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>and occasionally represented the
         Commonwealth. He served in the 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>General Assembly from 1875 until
         1879 as the state senator for 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Henrico County</geogname>. Apparently about 1879, he
         moved to 
         <geogname>Baltimore, Maryland</geogname>, where he set up a
         law practice with 
         <persname>John P. Poe</persname>, 
         <corpname>Johnson &amp; Poe</corpname>, Attorneys &amp;
         Counsellors at Law, at the corner of Lexington &amp; St. Paul
         Streets. He authored several books on history, genealogy, law,
         and the public debt.</p>
      <p>The business papers show that Johnson's interest in the
         manganese enterprise began in December of 1884, when Johnson
         entered into an agreement with 
         <persname>Frederick Stockton</persname>to buy the 
         <corpname>Jordan Mountain Manganese Mine</corpname>for 50,000
         dollars for the purpose of reselling the same; the ownership
         of part of this mine was in question and thus was under an
         injunction in a suit between Frederick W. &amp; 
         <persname>Charles A. Stockton</persname>and 
         <persname>Wesley N. Gould</persname>(who agreed to settle with
         Johnson for 5,000 dollars).</p>
      <p>According to a summary of the case, September 1887, 
         <persname>W. H. Harrison</persname>and 
         <persname>Andrew J. Guise</persname>came to Johnson's law
         office with an option to buy a manganese mine in 
         <geogname>New Brunswick</geogname>and hired Johnson as counsel
         to raise the money, buy the property, and work the mine. 
         <persname>John Browne</persname>, a mining engineer of 
         <geogname>New Brunswick</geogname>, had discovered the mine
         and agreed to a contract assigning his option for the
         property, which expired December 1887, to 
         <persname>Frederick W. Emmerson</persname>, 
         <persname>Walter H. Harrison</persname>, 
         <persname>Andrew J. Guise</persname>, and Johnson, each to
         have equal interest.</p>
      <p>Other items in the business papers documenting the
         progression of this business proposition include: an agreement
         between 
         <persname>John Browne</persname>, 
         <persname>Andrew J. Guise</persname>, and

         unencumbered manganese property for $50,000 (1887 Dec 7); the
         efforts of

         letter regarding the purchase of 
         <persname>Wesley N. Gould</persname>'s right to the manganese

         <persname>Frederick Stockton</persname>(1887 Dec 28); and a
         two month option from 
         <corpname>W. C. Pope &amp; Company</corpname>to buy their

         <geogname>New Brunswick</geogname>and to buy out all the
         conflicting interests for the benefit of the Mining Company,

         along with the Crimora Mine in

         between Whitely and Gaither and Harrison and Johnson (1889 Mar
         29). According to the bill of complaint of 
         <persname>Bradley T. Johnson</persname>against 
         <persname>Walter H. Harrison</persname>, "because of the
         fraudulent and corrupt action of the defendant the enterprise
         was fully and finally abandoned." Apparently Johnson was never
         able to consummate the sale of the property or to sell any
         manganese ore from the mines whatsoever.</p>
