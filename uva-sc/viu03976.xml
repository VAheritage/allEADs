</head>
      <p>Henry Clay was an American statesman whose masterly compromises on sectional issues helped pacify and preserve the nation during the troubled decades preceding the Civil War. In a long career in public service,
he was a Kentucky legislator, a U.S. Congressman (1811-1814, 1815-1821, 1823-1825) and speaker of the House of Representatives (1811-1814, 1815-1819, 1823-1825), Secretary of State, and several times a Senator
(1806-1807, 1810-11, 1831-1842, 1849-1852). Clay was a major promoter of the Missouri Compromise (1820), the compromise tariff of 1833 (ending the Nullification crisis), and the Compromise of 1850, all efforts to
balance the rights of free and slave states. Clay was twice the unsuccessful Whig candidate for president (1832, 1844). An excellent orator in an age that esteemed oratory, Clay was a charismatic leading statesman
of his period. He was impetuous by nature, on occasion rash in action, and sometimes selfish and arrogant as a Whig Party leader. Abraham Lincoln and William H. Seward later agreed that his selfishness had been
detrimental to the Whigs. Clay's championship of Latin American freedom strengthened the prestige of the United States in that part of the world and laid the foundations for Pan-Americanism. As a Whig leader, he
played an important role in establishing the two-party system that was so essential to the country's political stability. A gradualist, believing that change should come slowly, and a genius in the art of
compromise, he did much to hold the Union together in the four decades before the Civil War. And his devotion to tariffs and internal improvements furnished a basis for the domestic program that kept the
Republican Party in power in the years after the war and encouraged the nation's economic growth.
</p>
      <p>Henry Clay was born in Hanover County, Virginia on April 12, 1777, the seventh of nine children. His father, John Clay, was a former Baptist minister turned farmer. He died in 1781, and 10 years later Elizabeth
married Capt. Henry Watkins and moved to Richmond. In 1792 the couple moved to Kentucky, but Henry remained in Richmond as a deputy clerk in the high court of chancery. There he acted as amanuensis to Chancellor
George Wythe, who advised him to study law. Clay read law under the direction of Wythe and Attorney General Robert Brooke and, after a brief period of preparation, was admitted to the bar in 1797.
</p>
      <p>Clay was introduced to Richmond society and quickly acquired self-assurance there. However, he looked beyond Richmond for a place to practice law. Kentucky, where land suits were many, was a paradise for
lawyers, and Clay made his way there in the winter of 1797-1798, settling in Lexington, then a town of some 1,600 inhabitants.
</p>
      <p>Clay found the early West congenial. He established a law practice, which flourished, and made friends who shared his political views. On April 11, 1799, he married Lucretia Hart, youngest daughter of Col.
Thomas Hart, a wealthy merchant and land speculator. By 1805 Clay had acquired considerable property, as his profession brought him into close contact with the landed proprietors and the nascent industrial
interests of the growing West.
</p>
      <p>A Jeffersonian-Republican by conviction and education, Clay took an interest in politics almost from his arrival in Kentucky. He urged democratization of the state's constitution and a gradual emancipation of
slaves. Outspoken on national issues, too, he opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts, championed the Kentucky Resolutions, and campaigned for his party in 1800. In 1803 he was elected to the state legislature, where
he sponsored internal improvements and defended a banking venture upon which his friends and relatives had embarked. In 1806, as counsel for Aaron Burr, he obtained that adventurer's exoneration by a grand jury in
Frankfort, Ky., which refused to indict Burr on a charge of fomenting an expedition against Mexico. The defense of Burr on this occasion did Clay's reputation no harm, for Burr was then well thought of in Kentucky
and Clay had undertaken the case only upon Burr's most solemn pledge of innocence. Clay never forgave Burr for his duplicity. (This early hearing is not to be confused with Burr's trial for treason and acquittal
in Richmond, Va., in August 1807, in which Clay took no part.) In 1806, Clay went to the United States Senate to fill an unexpired term. His constituents sent him to the Kentucky legislature in 1807, where he was
elected speaker of the House of Representatives.
</p>
      <p>A duel with a Federalist opponent, Humphrey Marshall, in which Clay was slightly wounded, added to his popularity. He was easily reelected to the legislature in 1809 and was chosen by that body to fill another
unexpired term in the U. S. Senate, commencing in February 1810. There he stood for protection and declared himself an ardent expansionist. He opposed the recharter of the Bank of the United States in 1811, a
stand that was popular with the speculators and state banking interests of Kentucky. On returning home, he was elected to Congress, and when that body convened on Nov. 4, 1811, he was chosen Speaker of the House
of Representatives.
</p>
      <p>As Speaker, Clay increased the power of the office and strengthened his own political position. In doing so, he played a prominent part in inciting the War of 1812. One of the Indian-hating, land-hungry "War
Hawks," Clay appointed expansionists to important committee posts and by his speeches fomented the rising war fever. He sought vigorous prosecution of the war with Britain and at its close was one of the five
American members of the peace commission that concluded a status quo ante bellum peace, the Treaty of Ghent. He returned home by way of England, where he helped to conclude a commercial treaty. When Congress
reconvened in December 1815, he was reelected Speaker.
</p>
      <p>Ambitious, impetuous, and eloquent, Clay proceeded in the years following the War of 1812 to develop what became known as his "American System." Domestic improvements at national expense, a protective tariff, a
national bank, and finally cooperation with the South American patriots to enhance the U. S. position of leadership in the Western Hemisphere constituted the essence of his plan. Its development, he believed,
would bring the United States "to that height to which God and nature had destined it."
</p>
      <p>This program was carried out in part. The national bank was reinstated, and the protective tariff became law in 1816. But Clay's plans for internal improvements at national expense were thwarted by the
constitutional scruples of Presidents James Madison and James Monroe, and his demand for early recognition of the South American republics was countered by John C. Calhoun and John Quincy Adams, influential
members of Monroe's cabinet. Furthermore, Clay earned Andrew Jackson's enmity by bitterly censuring him for his conduct in the Florida expedition of 1818, and he sorely tried Monroe's patience by a policy of
carping criticism, which arose out of disappointment at not having been made Secretary of State in 1817. These shortcomings and limitations were more than offset, however, by his brilliant handling of the Missouri
Compromise, which earned him the title of the "Great Pacificator."
</p>
      <p>During the 1820's, Clay became more and more closely identified with the nation's economic upper class. His Kentucky estate, Ashland, and other property gave him a tax assessment of over $72,000 in 1831. His
views on financial matters during the panic of 1819 classed him with the creditor, anti-relief interests. His legal practice identified him closely with the privileged classes. All this boded ill for his political
ambition.
</p>
      <p>Clay sought the presidency in 1824, as did Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and William Harris Crawford, another member of Monroe's cabinet. Clay had the great disadvantage of running against another
contestant from the West, Jackson. The latter emerged from the contest with more electoral votes than anyone else, but since no candidate had a majority the election was to be decided in the House of
Representatives. Clay, who had run fourth, was no longer a candidate, but his influence as Speaker of the House for Adams was decisive. Adams made Clay Secretary of State, and Jackson and his friends promptly
raised the cry of "Bargain and Sale."
</p>
      <p>Before the election in the House, Adams and Clay in private conversations had disclosed to one another a fundamental harmony of views on public questions. There probably was a general understanding that Clay
was to receive some kind of recognition for his support. That the "bargain" went further than this is doubtful, but the charge of "Bargain and Sale" persisted. Clay never ceased his efforts to demonstrate the
purity of his motives in the 1824 election, and in 1826 he fought a bloodless duel with Sen. John Randolph of Virginia over the issue.
</p>
      <p>As Secretary of State, Clay sought to broaden U. S. trade and extend American influence in the Western Hemisphere through participation in the Panama Congress of 1826. But the American delegates to Panama, who
had to await confirmation from a reluctant Senate, arrived too late, and the role of the United States was ineffectual.
</p>
      <p>The political opposition to Clay's Pan-American policy was evidence of the crystallization of parties that took place during Adams' administration. Adams and Clay led the National Republicans, who summoned all
believers in protection and internal improvements to join their ranks. The opposition, led by Jackson, Calhoun, and Crawford, was a heterogeneous collection of men and principles; but it could claim with some
reason that the Clay-Adams party had inherited the mantle of conservative Federalism and that its own standard was the emblem of a revitalized Jeffersonianism which would cater to small farmers, workingmen, and
the debtor class. "Democracy" was its battle cry and General Jackson, the hero of New Orleans, its candidate.
</p>
      <p>In 1828, Adams went down to defeat before Jackson, and the latter's uneasy coalition took over. Clay was despondent, but his ardent imagination soon began picturing his own elevation to the presidency in 1832.
He denounced Jackson's use of the spoils of office and the veto power, and he championed internal improvements and protection. He returned to the Senate in 1831 and that same year was nominated for the presidency
by the National Republicans. Jackson was renominated by what was coming to be known as the Democratic party.
</p>
      <p>Clay's bid for election was based partly upon the assumption that the West was as eager for internal improvements as it was for cheap lands, and that the South would accept protection if it were labeled
"incidental." He was wrong on both counts. A further error was his decision to apply for a recharter for the Bank of the United States. The bank was unpopular, and the bill for its recharter was promptly vetoed by
Jackson in a ringing appeal to class hatred and sectional jealousy. The electorate responded with emphasis in 1832, Clay receiving 49 electoral votes to Jackson's 219.
</p>
      <p>Defeat did not quench Clay's ardor for public service. He was the guiding spirit in the passage of the Compromise Tariff of 1833, which put an end both to South Carolina's nullification of the tariffs of 1828
and 1832 and to Jackson's threats to use force against that state. The Compromise of 1833 added to Clay's reputation as a compromiser of sectional issues.
</p>
      <p>During Jackson's second term the Whig party, an amorphous combination of elements predominantly conservative in tone and nationalistic in outlook, came into being as the successor to the National Republicans.
Clay was its logical leader, and from his position in the Senate he strove to marshal the Whig forces in generally fruitless attacks upon Jackson's fiscal policies. The Kentuckian was anxious to obtain
renomination for the presidency in 1836, but the Whigs chose instead to follow the futile strategy of running several regional candidates against Martin Van Buren, Jackson's choice as his successor.
</p>
      <p>Reelected to the Senate in 1837, Clay once more led the assault upon Democratic measures, especially against Van Buren's independent treasury bill and against a proposed democratization of the government's land
policy. The first effort wholly and the second partly failed, but they placed Clay more firmly than ever on the side of the vested interests.
</p>
      <p>In regard to the growing problem of slavery, Clay also displayed his conservatism. Despite a genuine moral repugnance to slavery, as a Kentucky slaveholder he was himself involved in the "peculiar institution."
He had always espoused colonization of the blacks, a harmless, because impractical, remedy for slavery. He hated abolitionism, believing it to be a force that was dividing the sections and leading toward civil
war. While upholding the right of petition, he declared that abolitionist petitions should be rejected. He took a moderate position on the proposed annexation of Texas in the late 1830's. In these ways he tried to
forestall the controversy over slavery and at the same time retain his popularity in both North and South.
</p>
      <p>Clay had hoped to be Van Buren's opponent in 1840, but Thurlow Weed, Whig boss of New York state, and other northern Whig politicians wanted a new candidate. To Clay's disappointment, the choice of the Whigs
fell upon Gen. William Henry Harrison. The convention then chose John Tyler of Virginia, a supposed admirer of Clay and popular with the southern Whigs, as the vice presidential candidate. Clay supported this
ticket, though laying down a program for action that showed his conviction that the leadership of the party still belonged to him.
</p>
      <p>Dissension among the Whigs followed Harrison's death on April 4, 1841. Tyler was an anti-bank, anti-internal improvements, low-tariff Southerner who had no desire to promote the American System or to allow Clay
to usurp his prerogatives as the presidential leader of the Whig party. The Kentuckian was determined that he should lead and Tyler should follow. Under the circumstances, it was inevitable that Clay's program of
a national bank, a higher tariff, and the distribution of land sales to the states should meet a cold reception at the White House. Tyler vetoed two bank bills sponsored by Clay, and a bitter intra- party conflict
developed. Out of this Clay emerged as the leader of the Whigs. He resigned from the Senate early in 1842 to chart his course for 1844.
</p>
      <p>There was no significant challenge to Clay's nomination for the presidency in 1844, but a successful campaign was by no means assured. The question of the annexation of Texas was assuming great importance. In
his famous "Raleigh letter" of April 27, 1844, Clay came out against annexation "at the present time"; a similar letter by Van Buren (collusion has always been suspected but never proved) appeared on the same day.
The intent of the letters was to prevent Texas from becoming a campaign issue, but Van Buren's letter cost him the Democratic nomination, which went to expansionist James K. Polk.
</p>
      <p>Clay was nominated on May 1, and the Whigs conducted a spirited campaign. Texas was the issue. The Democrats declared that Clay was opposed to annexation, and under the weight of this charge his Southern
support began slipping away. Clay sought to explain his stand in the so-called Alabama letters, but in the North these letters produced a fatal drift of antislavery men from the Whig ranks. Polk was elected, and
Clay gloomily retired to Ashland. There he remained, deeply disturbed by the growth of the sectional conflict over slavery and by the Mexican War, of which he thoroughly disapproved and in which his son, Henry
Clay, Jr., was killed.
</p>
      <p>Clay wanted the Whig nomination again in 1848, but influential leaders in the party, both North and South, stood opposed. General Zachary Taylor, of Mexican War fame, was nominated by the Whigs in June 1848.
Clay bowed to the will of the convention, but throughout Taylor's successful campaign he remained in retirement at Ashland.
</p>
      <p>Clay returned to the Senate in 1849 to serve again in a time of crisis and division. The cession of California and the Southwest by Mexico at the end of the Mexican War had greatly heightened tension over
slavery. Northern opinion demanded the exclusion of slavery from the new territories, and in the South a secessionist movement of formidable proportions developed. Clay believed that if the Union were to be saved,
a great effort at compromise must be made. He formulated his plans, obtained Daniel Webster's promise of support, and at the close of January 1850 began his campaign.
</p>
      <p>In a series of resolutions, Clay discussed the principal questions agitating the country. His most important proposals were the admission of California as a free state, a more rigid fugitive slave law, and
provision that the new territories south of 36-degrees 30' should be organized without restriction as to slavery. During the spring and summer of 1850 he fought strenuously for this compromise. His plan, known as
the Compromise of 1850, became law after Clay had gone to Newport, R. I., for a rest. Its immediate passage owed much to Stephen A. Douglas and the Democrats in Congress; but to Clay must go the credit for its
conception and for arousing public opinion favorable to the measure.
</p>
      <p>Clay was not to live much longer after the passage of the compromise. He spent the summer of 1851 at Ashland, where he made his will, providing for the disposition of his estate and the freeing of his slaves.
Though dying of tuberculosis, he returned to Washington that fall and answered to the first Senate roll call. Thereafter he was closely confined to his room in the National Hotel, where he died on the morning of
June 29, 1852.
</p>
      <p>Clay was a conservative, and his appeal was essentially to the upper middle class. He sought by his American System to link East and West together under his leadership without alienating the South, but opposing
sectional interests stood in his way. The protective tariff could not be made into an advantageous issue for a national party. The West preferred cheap lands to a general distribution of land revenues. The South
had no more liking for internal improvements than for raising tariff rates.
</p>
      <p>Clay failed to achieve the presidency because of his mistakes of judgment and the machinations of professional politicians such as Thurlow Weed. But his services to his country in foreign affairs and in
effecting compromises at times of national crisis-especially the Compromise of 1850, which history considers his crowning achievement-give him high rank among American statesmen.

            <p>Clay replies that he is not able to give a more satisfactory account of the judgment against Chambers; owing to a blunder committed by the sheriff, the money has not been collected. Clay will write again and
expects the money "to be made in five or six months." He closes by asking for the return of his letter in which Mr. Grine [?] is mentioned as he has no recollection of that name.

recommended compromising with Mr. West, but Major chose instead to urge on "the controversy." Clay mentions that the appointment of officers in the new army will keep the House busy for several weeks. He closes by

personally." Clay believes there is no viable candidate for the presidential election to follow James Monroe's second term from either New York or Pennsylvania. He notes that "in the South, there are springing up
several candidates, my juniors in years and in terms of our respective service." Clay writes that his friends see nothing to "restrain them from bringing forward my name" as "[i]t is assumed that the Western
States from Ohio to the Gulph [sic] of Mexico will be firmly and ardently united in my support." New York should ally with the western states in the election since "by lending its support, either to New England or
to the South, it will not advance its pretensions one inch." Clay asks Porter if he "could not find time to employ your excellent pen in illustrating and enforcing those views of general and State policy which
ought to determine the judgment of New York, and which we think obviously indicate the expediency of her looking Westwardly?"

the father or son." It seems likely to Clay that John Quincy Adams will be elected President as the "probabilities appear to me to be greatly in his favor." Clay notes that Genl. [Andrew] Jackson has been elected
to the Senate. Clay understands "that the General has altered essentially his course of personal conduct; and has become extremely gentle, affable &amp; conciliatory" and asks what Leigh would "think of receiving
from him a sincere and cordial shake of the hand?"

offered him "my choice of notes out of its bill box in Lexington." Clay selected notes and turned them over to Mr. [James] Harper "to be offered to your Board at Lexington as
<emph render="underline">collateral security

that it will make the requisite order to receive the notes." Clay includes a list of the notes he wishes to assign to the Bank of the United States [not present].

with much philosophic composure and our friends, generally, are less affected than I feared they would be." Clay mentions that there is "vague speculation as to the intentions of the President elect. His own
friends even do not appear to know what they are." He says that the current session of Congress has been very quiet and the "Jackson party will probably remain quiet for the present." He mentions the Senate's
delay in confirming Mr. Hughs as ambassador to the Netherlands and Mr. [John Jordan] Crittenden to the Supreme Court. Clay closes by saying he will "return to Kentucky upon the close of the present administration,
and whether I shall take any part in public affairs hereafter, I shall then decide."

tranquil scenes of rural life, in spite of all the wickedness, violence, and hypocrisy which at present disgrace the Metropolis."

<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Niles' Register

sends condolences to his brother Peter H. Schenck.

Masonry" as he has been urged to do. He "cannot admit the propriety of blending either Masonry or Anti Masonry with Federal Politics. What has the General Govt. to do with either? What part of the Constitution
authorizes it to discountenance either? It has no more power to put down either than it has to interfere with any of the literary, benevolent or religious associations of the Country." Clay states that he does
"not think we ought to be diverted by Anti Masonry" in the attempt to oust the Jackson administration. He closes by mentioning Charles Hammond and discussing the Baltimore Convention.

            <p>Clay replies to Brown's letter of July 29th, which reached him "during my absence at the Olympian Springs." He comments on Mrs. Clay's health, the health of Brown's niece, and Brown's health. Clay thinks
Brown's "advice, in respect to public life is good," and that if he "could devise a proper and honorable mode, of withdrawing my name from public notice, I would instantly do it." Clay reports that the recent
elections in Kentucky resulted "in a majority for the Jackson party in Congress, and a majority to the opposition in the Legislature-a drawn battle." Clay mentions that he is planning to place his "son James in
some Counting House at Philadelphia" and asks if Brown can assist him with any of his "mercantile acquaintances." He closes by stating that his "crops are fine, especially our great Staple, Corn. I am pleased with
the occupation, and the prospect of the profits of farming; but Mrs. Clay's repugnance to the cares of a Country life may induce us, possibly, to go to town."

            <p>Clay acknowledges that "several of my prominent friends at Cincinnati were extremely discouraged by the issue of our Congressional elections, and were entertaining the project of substituting some other name to
mine, as a Candidate for the Presidency." Clay states that he "should most cordially agree to such an arrangement, and even urge it, if such a substitute can be found with the approbation of our friends
generally." He discusses the strengths needed by a candidate and says that "I am not an impartial if competent person to make this enquiry." He comments on the suggestion of John Marshall as a candidate and says
he would be "delighted" to see Marshall as President instead of Jackson. He concludes that the party would be well served by waiting to see how events develop and says "we should not despair, certainly not of the
Republic, if we do of our Candidate."

the "Anti Masonic Convention" in Philadelphia, at which Wirt was nominated. Clay states that the National Republican Party should forbear "to attach Anti Masonry or Mr. Wirt" because the convention "may think it
is politic to nominate him" and "it is prudent to the leave the door open to his party and him to unite with us."

here to have been the best that could have been made." Clay has seen John C. Calhoun "several times, but have had no political conversation with him." Clay does not believe Calhoun will be a candidate for the
Presidency. If Andrew Jackson approves a bill to recharter the Bank of the United States, Clay says "it has been suggested that [Littleton W.] Tazewell will be brought out as the Southern Candidate for President."

            <p>"Confidential" in Clay's hand following salutation. Clay discusses the Compromise Tariff bill and says that a "large section of the Jackson party, headed by Mr. V. Buren, will attempt either to impress the
North with the belief that its interest were injuriously affected...or the South with the opinion that its interests were not sufficiently attended to." He then tells Wilde that "the danger you apprehend from a
surplus Revenue will not be realized." Clay says that "passage of the Land Bill would have afforded further security, and I think most desirable security, against the extraordinary inconvenience of a superabundant
exchequer." Clay will introduce a new land bill in the next session of Congress. Clay states that the "prospects of a renewal of the Charter of the U. States bank have decidedly improved" and he does "not despair
of its being accomplished." Clay concludes by discussing the possibility of the emancipation of slaves in the British West Indies and says that the "danger is perhaps not sufficiently near or great to justify any
interference from us." He says that slavery "lies at the bottom of many of the evils under which the Southern Atlantic States are suffering" and though Wilde has Constitutional grounds to protest "against the
slightest interference of the Genl. Government with the institution of Slavery or the condition of its unfortunate subjects, it is perfectly manifest, I think, that you will have soon to alter materially the
character of their labor. You will either have to find new products for it, or new markets for its present products."

            <p>Clay mentions that a "few stragling cases of Cholera" continue in Lexington and that several families have lost slaves to the disease. Clay's son and daughter-in-law are expecting a child this month. The
possibility of the emancipation of slaves in the British West Indies "will exert a moral influence on that institution in the U. States; but I do not apprehend any immediate effects from it" and does not believe
emancipation will happen in the United States "in our time." Clay predicts that Southern slave owners will be "more sensitive to the slightest disturbance of the question." Northerners are "probably interested in
the continuance of Southern slavery."

arrangement with Barbour, "putting in 1250 acres of first rate Red River land at valuation (he has been offered $10 per acre) and the slaves at valuation, and working the whole together." Bullard says such an
arrangement would produce 300 bales of cotton per year. Clay says that though cotton "has fallen to thirteen cents" he believes Barbour can count on $500 apiece for the slaves.

rid of, if it were practicable." "In spite of the delusions of those who are directly interested in its preservation, and of the rash and impolitic interference of those who have no direct interest and no right to
interfere about it, undoubtedly it is fraught with great mischiefs to both races, to say nothing of the injustice which it inflicts upon one of them." Separation of the races, "by first Colonizing the free blacks
and afterwards with the consent of the Slave States, the class of slaves," is the only practical solution. Clay then comments on the country's "Commercial embarrassment" and mentions a reduction in the price of
cotton. "The measures of Government have beyond all doubt contributed largely to produce the present calamitous state of affairs."

            <p>Clay tells Baldwin that in regards to slavery, the tariff and internal improvement, he expressed himself "as fully and as explicitly as language can admit of during the last Session of the Senate of the U.S."
Clay says that the slave states "have
<emph render="underline">exclusive
</emph> power" over the institution; that "Congress has no power touching the institution" and further has "no power to prevent the removal of slaves from one Slave State to another;" and, finally, that Congress
cannot abolish slavery "in the D. of Columbia or in the territories, without a violation of good faith." Clay states that he supports a "bill to distribute among the States the proceeds of the public lands" for
internal improvements. He supports the Bank of the United States "for the benefits of the institution," but is unconcerned about its location. Clay tells Baldwin that he cannot consent to the publication of this
letter. He mentions that the voters of Kentucky have voted down a proposed convention, which was supported "principally by Van Buren men." He tells Baldwin that he is not "a friend to Slavery" and that it is "an
evil." However, Clay believes "it better that Slaves should remain Slaves than be set loose as free men among us." Such Clay says was the belief of "our Revolutionary ancestors." The current defense that "Slavery
is a blessing" is "espoused by the new school in South Carolina." Clay says that if this is true "the more of it the better; and it is immaterial upon that hypothesis, whether the slaves be black or white." Clay
concludes that he is not a candidate for the Presidency and that to speak on the use of the veto by the President would be improper.

in the most friendly spirit" and stated that he "had never desired to be thrown into a competition with me, whose election he

York and questions how the "Administration party" has been able to make gains. He says that "the Administration has put its hands, in its desperation, into the public treasury, and taken out hundreds of thousands
of dollars to use in purposes of corruption." Clay says that he fears his prediction that "Jackson ruled by intimidation and V. Buren would by corruption" has come true. Clay comments on the "Staunton Convention"

            <p>Tyler apologizes for not answering Clay's letter earlier. Tyler says that no one should expect him to bring before Congress "matured plans of public policy connected with deeply interesting and intricate
subjects." Some issues, such as the "repeal of the subtreasury" and "the state of our military defences" require immediate attention. "It will however be for Congress to decide whether other measures shall claim
its attention." Tyler says that his opinions "on the subject of a distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands" were made known three years previous in a report to the Virginia House of Delegates.
He says that the "annual appropriation to harbours and rivers" is "wholly indefensible in any view in which I can regard it." In regards to "a Bank...I would not have it urgd [sic] prematurely-The public mind is
still in a state of great disquietude in regard to it." He tells Clay that "Jackson tore the charter of the old Bank into tatters-and his followers will go forth as agitators and the result of thier [sic]
agitations may prove dissastrous [sic]." Tyler urges Clay to attempt "to frame a Bank as to avoid all constitutional objections" and repeats that he has "no intention to submit any thing to Congress on this
subject to be acted on." Tyler closes by saying his "attention is turned to the removals from office after the manner that you suggest."

            <p>Clay thanks Sargent for his recent letter and mentions John D. Langhorne. Clay says he is "glad the N.E. question is settled, altho' the terms are curious enough." He wonders what President Tyler "will do with
the Tariff, and, if he veto it, what Congress will then do." Clay says Kentucky is blessed with abundant crops and he is "making extensive preparations to Water rot hemp."

tariff protections or the establishment of a Bank of the United States. Clay says that such debates "might be made highly instrumental in propagating truth &amp; dispelling error."

            <p>Clay describes his "Southern jaunt," from which he has just returned. If he should be selected as the candidate of the Whigs for the presidency he believes the vote of Kentucky "is no more certain than that of
Louisiana." Clay believes that both Mississippi and Alabama will vote Whig, though "a bitter schism exists on the bank question in Alabama, and on repudiation in Mississippi...and in both on the Presidency." Clay
tells Leigh that he "heartily concurs" with the address of the Whig convention in Virginia to the people. He states that the "brief notice with which Mr. Tyler is treated in the address was wise." Clay says there
is an omission in the address that he regrets; that is, "Executive power &amp; the veto." He closes with regard to Chapman Johnson, Francis T. Brooke, Robert Stanard and Julia Wickam Leigh.

letter miscarried. Clay says he is "surprized and gratified" by the Virginia election results and is confident of success in Tennessee and Indiana. Clay closes with a postscript in which he states that he is
"informed from N. York that some of the Intriguers of 1839 are again engaged in active machinations."

publication, so far from injury would benefit me in respect to the charge of bargain." If Leigh and others in Virginia think publication will help, Clay has no objections. He asks that if the letters are published
"it would perhaps be best to say, that it was done by friends of Mr. Clay upon their own responsibility...Credit should be claimed for me, which I think I deserve for abstaining from the publication on account of
the private playful and familiar character of the letters, although the evidence which they contain in regard to the public charge, is really beneficial to me." Clay discusses the public accessibility of the
letters over the years and states that the contents do not differ substantially from his letter to his constituents in March 1824. Clay closes by stating that this letter "has been written by an amanuensis upon my
dictation, although I am happy to tell you, that my health is now excellent and never was better."

            <p>"Private" above salutation. Clay thanks Lawrence for his recent letter and mentions that he has received a Baltimore newspaper "containing what occurred in the British House of Commons on the Oregon subject."
Clay has long believed that difficulties "would arise out of the headlong course of our Government in respect to Oregon, at the very moment when a negotiation is in progress with Great Britain." Clay believes it
"premature" to settle the Pacific coast and maintain defences "at a time when we have quite enough to defend the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulph of Mexico." Clay says that he is apprehensive "that we
are shortly to have war with both England and Mexico. The party in power has not the moral courage to do right." Clay fears that Great Britain will, because of the annexation of Texas, see "dangers to all her
American possessions ahead" and possibly craft an alliance with Mexico. Such an alliance would be "capable of inflicting much mischief, especially on the Pacific." Clay believes "that there is a strong possibility
of war." He asks Lawrence to send him a full report of Lord Russell's speech if possible. Clay closes with a postscript stating, "I have dictated the above to an amanuensis."

measure of the leg and foot which he kindly desires to cover." Clay fears that the old boot, "if I were to send one, might never reach its destination. It would be an inconvenient customer to the P.[ost] Office
department...and if sent through any other, it might, by mistake, get upon some other leg &amp; foot, and lead its strange companion a dance." Clay encloses [not present] a "paper measure of my leg and foot, taken
by a plain but worthy boot and shoemaker in Lexn." who is, like Mr./ Fischerman "a foreigner" and "a good whig." A note below Clay's signature in an unidentified hand states "The boots were made in an elegent
[sic] &amp; comfortable manner under my superintedance [sic], with the hair (undressed inside) and were as a beautiful a specimen of the Mechanic art as I remember to have seen. Mr. Clay recd them &amp; expressed

mentions his astonishment "at the course of the Ohio delegation." He says it is his "inclination, and perhaps my duty, quietly to submit to the decision of the Convention,
<emph render="underline">so far as I am personally concerned
</emph> . Beyond that I feel under no obligation to go." Clay says that Zachary Taylor would not have withdrawn his name were Clay nominated. Clay says "Genl. Taylor professes to be a Whig in name, but disclaims
all obligations to carry our Whig principles and measures. In that respect his case differs entirely from that of Genl [William Henry] Harrison." Clay has no advice to offer his friends. He desires "all the
information I can get about the Convention, its secret movements and springs." Clay closes with warm regards and mentions Abraham R. Lawrence and Charles S. Morehead.

            <p>Clay thanks Pierse for his recent letters and sympathizes with the illness that kept Pierse from attending the Whig convention in Philadelphia. Clay says that the "President elect will not find himself at
Washington on a bed of roses." The most important issue is the "Free soil question" which, if it should "remain unadjusted during his administration, I fear it will widen the existing breach between the South and
North." Clay says that he is not surprised that Pierse wishes to go to California. "To those whose age and condition in life admit of their going there, the Country offers great inducements and attractions." Clay
does not know if a governor will be appointed for California and is "unwilling to make any recommendation for that office."

Missouri into the Union. And if he ever reproached me with my agency in the matter, I have forgotten it." Clay says he would "deplore the event of the Administration being thrown into the minority in the H. of R.
It would be bad for them, bad for the Whig party and bad for the Country." He is apprehensive that Kentucky will not elect additional Whigs in the next election. Clay comments on the political situation in Ohio
and says that Pierse's "conjectures are correct in regard to the President's feelings towards me." Clay closes by saying the cholera "still lingers with us" but he has "lost no one."

necessary." Clay says that he will "be entirely content with any decision you make." He closes by saying he has enclosed a letter from his son [not present] to show "what serious consequences sometimes result from
the free conversations between Members of Congress, and foreign members."
