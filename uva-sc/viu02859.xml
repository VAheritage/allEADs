      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers of James Westhall Ford (ca. 1806-1868), a
         portrait painter who spent most of his life in Virginia,
         consist of some 577 items, ca. 1804-1874. Most of these (417)
         are financial documents and business correspondence. Personal
         correspondence, legal documents, scrapbook material, a
         commonplace book, and wallet account for the rest.</p>
      <p>Ford, whose identity was virtually forgotten before the
         discovery of these papers, owed much of his early success to
         the friendship and patronage of Thomas Jefferson. Three
         letters from Jefferson during September 1823 gave Ford entree
         to the political world of Virginia and Washington D.C. One of
         these, September 1, 1823, establishes Ford as the probable
         "artist unknown" responsible for a portrait of Jefferson's
         daughter Martha Jefferson Randolph. Through Jefferson, Ford
         was invited to paint a portrait of President James Monroe.
         Monroe later (1825) wrote a letter of introduction for Ford to
         Col. Robert Y. Hayne (of the Webster-Hayne debates). Ford's
         friendship with Jefferson led to a series of portraits of
         University of Virginia faculty.</p>
      <p>Ford worked out of Richmond for most of the years between
         1825 and 1859. He occasionally traveled through the Shenandoah
         Valley painting portraits along the way. Newspaper clippings
         refer to stops in Haymarket, Mantua, Staunton, and other
         towns. Correspondence and newspaper clippings place him in
         Pittsylvania County, Virginia in 1858, and in Danville in
         1859. As the Civil War approached, Ford's sympathies led him
         to Philadelphia where he lived until his death in 1868.</p>
      <p>Business letters from E. Newland to James W. Ford relates
         to art supplies and picture frames ordered by Ford between
         1842 and 1858. Included are bills of lading, shipping
         receipts, account statements, and letters from Newland
         relating to problems with shipments and with Ford's occasional
         delinquent payments.</p>
      <p>The commonplace book contains a handwritten title page by
         Ford that gives his name as Westhall (a verse written by his
         wife Ann on his death gives his middle name as West). The book
         has notes on subjects ranging from recipes for goldsize and
         liquid blacking to instructions for the painting of miniatures
         and the preparation of canvas for painting. There are also
         several doodles and sketches.</p>
      <p>The wallet is of brown leather and is signed in ink "James
         W. Ford 1830 Richmond." There is also a monogram "JWF" in
         ink.</p>
      <p>Correspondence folders include letters for most of the
         years from 1823 to 1874. Most of these are letters of
         introduction and personal letters from friends of James and
         Ann Ford. They contain pleasantries, inquiries after the
         health of the Fords, and reports on the health of mutual
         friends. Photostats of the letters from Jefferson (Sep 1, 8,
         and 30, 1823) and Monroe (Aug 1, 1825) are in Correspondence
         folder 1823- 1828.</p>
      <p>A letter from R. R. Robinson at Vicksburg, Mississippi,
         dated Jan. 11, 1836, contains observations concerning the
         situation on the frontier, land speculation in Texas and
         Arkansas, and prospects for trade on the Mississippi
         River.</p>
      <p>A letter of introduction (Mar 19, 1836) from Andrew Beirne
         to Andrew Jackson recommends Ford as a portrait painter of
         note. Beirne was a Representative from Virginia who served in
         the 25th and 26th Congresses (1837-1841).</p>
      <p>Letters to Ford from J. C. Cabell (Nov 27, 1840) and W. H.
         Woodley (Jan 25, 1841) refer to University of Virginia faculty
         portraits; Cabell Hall was named in honor of J.C. Cabell.
         Woodley was proctor at the University from 1837 to 1845.</p>
      <p>A letter from Robert B. Bolling of Petersburg (1842)
         requests Ford to come immediately to Petersburg for the
         purpose of "taking the likeness" of the very recently deceased
         infant daughter of David Dunlap. Another letter, dated May 23,
         1846, from Alexander Bryant of Mantua, refers to the Mexican
         War, President James K. Polk, and the Loco-Foco Party.</p>
      <p>There are two letters ( Dec 25, 1848 and Jan 23, 1849) from
         Ford to his wife Ann. A letter from Mariah Clopton (Clapton?)
         to Ann Ford (May 17, 1866) includes a brief, eye-witness
         account of the burning of Richmond [April 2, 1865] at the end
         of the Civil War.</p>
      <p>Personal correspondence between the Fords and the family of
         Josiah Wills of Norfolk is contained in a separate
         folder. Extending from 1839 to 1848, it deals largely with
         family matters of both a personal and financial nature. A
         number of letters deal with problems associated with Sister
         Sarah Alvey; others relate to Wills's efforts to sell a slave
         by the name of Delphia. In a letter dated January 13, 1840,
         Mr. Wills writes that he has "sent to you my negro Woman
         Delphia to be sold to the highest bidder or for the best price
         you can obtain." A subsequent letter (July 28, 1840) reveals
         that Delphia does not like to live in Norfolk and has been
         sent "again to Richmond to be disposed of."</p>
      <p>Financial Documents includes a variety of receipts and
         account statements for the years between 1804 to 1870,
         including some undated material. Legal documents include the
         Fords' marriage certificate. The Scrapbook Material folder
         contains an assortment of newspaper clippings, two small
         notebooks, poetry, prayers, and inspirational quotations.
         There is also an item resembling a diary page from Christmas
         1818. Some of this material is undated.</p>
