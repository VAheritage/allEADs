      <p><emph render="bold">Richard Watkins Carrington
         (1888-1933)</emph>was born in Richmond, Virginia, on May 19,
         1888, to Tazewell Morton and Julia (Watkins) Carrington.
         Richard Carrington attended McGuire's University School of
         Richmond, and then entered Hampden-Sydney College, graduating
         in 1907 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Carrington received
         his law degree from the University of Virginia in 1910, and
         belonged to the Richmond City, Virginia State, and American
         Bar Associations. Elected to the General Assembly as a
         Democrat, he served in the sessions of 1918 and 1919 on the
         general laws and insurance and banking committees. He was also
         a director of the Union Bank of Richmond, a member of the
         congregation of the Second Presbyterian Church, a member of
         the Board of Directors of the Country Club of Virginia, and a
         member of the Commonwealth Club. During the Great War,
         Carrington entered the Officer's Training School at Fort
         Monroe, but the armistice was signed before he saw active
         service. On November 4, 1915, Richard Carrington married 
         <emph render="bold">Delia Davenport,</emph>a daughter of
         Charles and Ellen (McCaw) Davenport, residents of Richmond,
         Virginia. They had two children, Richard Watkins Carrington,
         Jr., born on January 9, 1917, and Delia Davenport, born on
         December 14, 1919. Charles Davenport was the son of Isaac
         Davenport, Jr. and Ellen (McCaw) Davenport, was the daughter
         of Dr. James B. McCaw.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Tazewell Morton Carrington
         (1857-?)</emph>was a prominent figure in the tobacco industry,
         serving as head of the Carrington Company in Richmond,
         Virginia, one of the largest businesses dealing in leaf
         tobacco, and president of the Tobacco Association of the
         United States. Tazewell Carrington was born in Richmond,
         Virginia, on February 21, 1857, to William Tucker and Bettie
         L. (Morton) Carrington. He was educated at the McGuire School
         at Richmond, and attended the University of Virginia for one
         year, 1875-1876. He has served as president of the Chamber of
         Commerce of Richmond, and as a director in both the First

         Richmond. During World War I, in 1918, T.M. Carrington was
         state chairman of the United War Work Campaign in Virginia. He
         was also a member and elder of the Second Presbyterian Church.
         He was married to Julia M. Watkins (d. 1900), daughter of
         Richard V. Watkins, on January 21, 1886, in Halifax County,
         and they had three sons: Richard W. Carrington, who married
