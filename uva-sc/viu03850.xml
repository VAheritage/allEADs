</head>
         <p>David Graves George, a Pittsylvania songwriter, former railroad worker, tobacco farmer, water tower tender, telegrapher, Deputy U.S. Marshall and later resident of Detroit claimed to have written the famous
song "The Wreck of the Old '97". George rose to national fame when he filed a lawsuit in 1928 claiming he was the original author of the time honored railroad ballad. He spent many years of his life in court
battles trying to prove authorship and receive compensation for the song that the Victor Talking Machine Company released in 1924. The song became a hit record selling over one million copies. George claimed not
to have known that the song had been published until, 1928, when he read a trivia question in the local paper, the News Leader, asking who knew the identity of the author of the popular hit song.
</p>
         <p>Mr. George claimed to have seen the famous train 'Old 97' speeding down the track from where he worked in Franklin Junction. (Gretna, Virginia). When the train reached Danville, it went out of control and
plunged from the curved trestle into the bank killing eleven trainmen, including the engineer. After the wreck which occurred in 1903, George is said to have written the ballad "The Wreck of the Old '97" and given
copies to his friends. The Supreme Court ruled in his favor in 1938, stating that the Victor Talking Machine Company pay George $65,295.00. It is not known if George accepted this amount.

         <head>Scope and Content
</head>
         <p>The collection contains ca. 46 items (half of one Hollinger box) less than one linear foot and is chiefly concerned with David George's lawsuit against the Victor Talking Machine Company over authorship and
royalties for the song "The Wreck of the Old '97". The song was based on the mail train number ninety-seven that ran daily from Washington D.C. to Atlanta and wrecked near Danville, Virginia in 1903. The legal
battles over the song began in 1928 and went on until 1938 with verdicts see-sawing back and forth between the two parties.
</p>
         <p>Included in the collection which spans from 1903, 1928 to 1966 is a typed sheet of the original seven stanzas of the song purportedly used by George in court; letters written by George to his son during the
depositions and trials; other family letters, greeting cards and photographs; a typed manuscript of "Old '97 Rolls Home" written by his son David Gordon George (Jack) giving an account of the events in his
father's life related to the song; a letter to Lynn Shelton, editor of the Gazette-Virginian, from Jim Walsh disclaiming George as the author of the song (September, 1966); a letter from George's son to newspaper
editor Lynn Shelton defending his father's claim to authorship (October,1966- also includes the original typed letter); a contract between George and his son for the loan of the money to appeal his claim to the
Supreme Court. There are also obituaries, and news articles of George's death from the Richmond Times Dispatch, the Norfolk Virginia-Pilot, and the Danville Register as well as a funeral service book and
memorandum; two letters from Virginius Dabney to George's son offering condolences for the death of his father, and many newspaper articles about George's lawsuits.

</p>
         <p>There is an obituary of J.J. Dunlap who was a survivor of the 'Old 97'and who died one week before the anniversary of the wreck; an obituary for David George's wife Maria. There is also a letter to the editor
of The Daily Advance called "Old 97" from Robert P. Stickley of Lynchburg showing gratitude to the Danville Bi-Centennial Commission, the newspaper, and the author of the ballad for trying to preserve the memory
of the train.
