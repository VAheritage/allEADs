      <p>There are ca. 90 items, 1920-1978 and no date, kept by Mary

      <p>Church-related material includes a bound volume of the
         minutes of meetings, October 1943 - January 1944, of the
         Baptist Adult Union and a bound volume, May - August 1945, of
         notes of the committee to select a pastor to succeed Henry
         Alford Porter as pastor of the First Baptist Church of
         Charlottesville. There is also a bound volume, 1935, of
         material pertaining to missions: "Making Missions Real" and
