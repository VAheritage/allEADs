            <p>A draft of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">After the Supper and Talk
</title> on one composite leaf comprising at least seven irregularly cut fragments of different types of white paper pasted to each other and, collectively, to one leaf (25 x 20 cm.) of blue-ruled white laid paper
with a partly visible watermark. In brown-black and black ink with extensive revisions in the same inks, in pencil, and in lighter brown ink. This poem was rejected by
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Harper's
</title> in 1885 but published in
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Lippincott's Magazine
</title> in November 1887, after which it eventually became the final poem in the "first annex" titled
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Sands at Seventy.
</title> To the verso are pasted sections 16 and 18-19 of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Poem of Joys
</title> (final title:
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">A Song of Joys
</title>) clipped either from the independent book
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Passage to India
</title> (1871) or from the
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Passage to India
</title> supplement to
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves of Grass.
</title> The section numbers of these lines are deleted in orange crayon, and the whole paste-on is deleted in pencil, with the pencil note, in a hand other than Whitman's, "Original mss/ Walt Whitman/ Poet"
appearing to the right of it.
</p>
            <p>This is an earlier draft than manuscripts located in the Feinberg Collection at the Library of Congress. The order of inscription seems to have been as follows, as deduced from incision patterns, paper types,
and the overlap of letters on transferred sections of paper. First Whitman inscribed and heavily revised a draft of the poem on a section of gray-ruled wove paper. Wanting to avoid rewriting the clearest lines, he
excised these (comprising the first two verses and the words "Shunning the..." from the original third verse) and pasted them to a section of blue-ruled wove paper with letterhead reading, in part, "Attorney.../
Washington...," apparently discarding the section of gray-ruled paper upon which the rest of the original verses appeared. These excised verses he drafted again on the blue-ruled paper. He then used a paste-on
fragment of laid paper to revise the second half of the verse beginning "Shunning..."; at the end of the sentence, however, he deleted the period and added the words "so hard to unclasp his hand[s?]!" (That he
added this as an afterthought is indicated by the fact that the half-line is crowded in over a preexisting curve along the lower edge of the laid fragment). Unsatisfied with the addition, he deleted part of it,
tested and deleted the phrase "release those hands", deleted "so hard to," and then, out of space, squeezed a revision of this line in on the gray-ruled paper after the verse "Good-bye...repeating." It next
occurred to Whitman to add an explanatory line beginning "(No more will they meet...)" after "hands," but since he had no space in which to do so he cut apart the composite leaf and pasted the two halves to a
small section of wove paper—just large enough to hold the pieces together and afford room for the parenthesis. In revising the parenthesis, however, he ran out of space again. It was at this point that he
obtained the large section of blue-ruled laid paper upon which the other sections are all overlaid, and, cutting away the second half of the parenthetical verse, pasted both of what were now composite half-leaves
to the blue-ruled leaf. He then inscribed on this leaf the title, his revision of the rest of the parenthetical verse (in space he left between the composite halves), and the revised final verse. (It is difficult
to determine at what point Whitman excised the title and last verse from the composite leaves, beyond noting that he did so before pasting the leaves to the blue-ruled section).

one leaf is inscribed. All but a handful of the leaves are inscribed on white laid paper ruled in light blue-green on both sides or on all of one side and some of the other. In his

<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Modern Philology
</title> (vol. 52, no. 1), Fredson Bowers grouped the leaves by cutting-type as follows (letters having been added here for convenience). Type A: Leaves 1 and 21. Type B: Leaves 2-3. Type C: Leaves 4-5 and 15-16.
Type D: Leaves 6-9, 12-14, and 19. Type E: Leaves 17-18. As Bradley and Blodgett note, this poem was first published in the

</title>, where the poem appeared without its original first two verse paragraphs. At one point this manuscript was in the possession of Whitman scholar Clara Barrus, who clipped to Whitman's title page a note
including these lines: "...Precious souvenirs, given me by Thos. B. Harned, one of Whitman's literary executors. You can almost feel Walt's heart beat in these lines." This and other short notes by Barrus have
been unclipped from the leaves. Annotations by Barrus (or another collector with a similar hand) are mentioned when significant enough to warrant attention, but are otherwise left undescribed.

the leaf, deleted, reads "The great Harvest of 1867"). After further revision these sections became, respectively, verse paragraphs 1 and 2 (together comprising section 1) of the 1871 version of the poem. In 1881,
this entire section, as noted above, was deleted from the poem.

of the leaf, along with the note "I—." With further revision—including the deletion of the last line, beginning "O theatre of Time,..."—these sections became verse paragraphs 3 and 4 (comprising
section 2) of the 1871 version of the poem. In 1881 these paragraphs went unnumbered and, with the deletion of the original first section, together formed section 1 of the poem (hence the "I" added by Barrus).

paragraph 15 (section 7) of the 1871 version of the poem, and in 1881 made up the final unnumbered verse paragraph of section 5.

              <physdesc>On a section of type D paper (19.5 x 12.5 cm.), with three pinholes in center. Inscribed and revised in pencil on both sides. The recto lines represent a relatively early draft of what would become verse
paragraphs 16 and 17 (the first part) in section 8 of the 1871 version of the poem, which would go on to make up the first two unnumbered verse paragraphs of section 6 in the 1881 version. The verso lines
(beginning "But I must bring/ the dead"), deleted with a single curved pencil stroke, constitute an earlier version of the lines on Leaf 12.

              <p>On a section of type C paper (19.5 x 12.5 cm.), with multiple pinholes in center. Inscribed and revised on both sides in pencil. The recto lines were revised to constitute the second part of verse paragraph 17
and all of verse paragraph 18 (section 8) in the 1871 version of the poem. In 1881 they made up most of the second and all of the third unnumbered verse paragraphs of section 6. The verso lines (beginning "Now a
passage/ of/ Exultation"), deleted with a single vertical pencil stroke, seem more like a note from Whitman to himself than a draft of poetic verses, but the word "Exult" does appear on leaves 15 and 16, as in
verse paragraph 20 (section 9) of the 1871 version.

(which was revised on Leaf 17), along with other trial verses in pencil, are all deleted with several pencil strokes. The remaining verses at the foot of the leaf were revised to form verse paragraph 19 (section

verse paragraph 21 (section 9) in the 1871 version of the poem. The lines beginning "Exult" were slightly revised to form verse paragraph 20. In the 1881 version these lines made up the entire fifth unnumbered

inscribed and extensively revised in pencil, with two corrections in brown-black ink; the verso is inscribed and deleted (with two parallel strokes) in pencil. The recto lines became the final verses of the poem
in both 1871 (7-11, verse paragraph 32, section 13) and 1881 (7-11, sixth verse paragraph, section 8). The trial line on the verso, beginning "Actively moving, the curious/ machines..."—followed by Whitman's
note "(list)"—represents an early draft of lines on leaves 1 (verso), 22, and 25, which were revised to form verse paragraph 29 (section 12) in 1871 and the third verse paragraph of section 8 in 1881.
Following this leaf is a blank section of white wove paper (20 x 14.5 cm.), ruled in blue on both sides with a red and blue vertical rule, and featuring a thin section of hand-annotated printed matter affixed to
the left margin. The strip, only printed on one side, has been folded in half and pasted together; the only legible word on it is the holograph note "(England)" in dark brown ink, which may not be in Whitman's
hand.

athletic[,] full of love..." calls to mind the verse "If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred,/ And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted,/ And in man or woman a clean, strong,
firm-fibred body, is more beautiful/ than the most beautiful face" from the untitled 1855 poem that would become

then adding two paste-ons (roughly 5.5 and 4 x 21.5 cm.) to this extra section. Inscribed and revised in dark brown-black ink, with Whitman's signature and the note "You can put the name W[alt] W[hitman?] either
at the top or/ bottom as you prefer" at the foot of the leaf. On the verso appear the notes "Death's Valley" (twice) and "Magazine/ April, 1892" in Whitman executor Horace Traubel's[?] hand. Whitman's
correspondence indicates that the poem was written and sold to
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Harper's New Monthly Magazine

            <p>On one leaf of white wove paper (19.5 x 12.5 cm.), irregularly cut along the left margin. Inscribed in dark brown ink, with extensive revisions in the same ink, in a fine pen, and in pencil, apparently in that
order. The subtitle has a horizontal pencil line through it, but a zig-zag pencil line through it seems to have been erased, along with the phrase "(at the entrance)" below it. The title

<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Inscriptions
</title> Whitman gathered in a notebook, along with prose drafts for a never-finished introduction to
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves of Grass
</title>, and attached to his copy of the 1855 paper-bound edition of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves
</title>. (The entire collection of draft "inscription" and introductory material is currently housed at the New York Public Library.) In the 1867
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves
</title> Whitman culled material from this poem and the other
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Inscription
</title> poems to create an italicized
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Inscription
</title> that he placed before
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Starting from Paumanok
</title> at the beginning of the book; in that edition he also transferred part of verse 2 to
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">As I Sat Alone by Blue Ontario's Shore
</title> (later the line was dropped and the title was revised to
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">By Blue Ontario's Shore
</title>). From 1872 onward, this poem, revised and retitled
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">One's-Self I Sing,
</title> was printed as the first of several poems in the
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Inscriptions

<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">November Boughs
</title>, however, Whitman reprinted the 1867 version as
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Small the Theme of my Chant.
</title> Note: This draft may have been written before the Civil War, since it does not include the 1867 line "My Days I sing, and the Lands—with interstice I knew/ of hapless War."

of the note. A faint horizontal line beneath part of "A City Walk," along with the words' capitalization and central position on the page, indicate that Whitman may have contemplated using the words as the title
of an independent poem. The closest he came to this title was

</title> in the 1867 edition. These notes, written in the form of a single poetic verse, could represent an intermediate stage between the notes on Leaf 3 and those on Leaf 5. Bucke prints the lines in prose form

before being pasted to the lower section. Inscribed in dark brown-black ink with no revisions. The trial verses on the lower section (beginning "Poem—As of walking along a street") are fragmentary and
hurriedly inscribed, but the upper section is written in ornamental script, and both parts of the title are underlined. A wavy line appears at the foot of that section. The word "Original" at the head of the upper

lines on the verso are deleted with a single vertical pencil stroke. They originally occupied the lower half of a full leaf of verse; after deleting these (current) verso lines and discarding the upper half of the
leaf Whitman turned the page ninety degrees and flipped it over to use for the current recto notes. The recto notes represent an early stage of lines partially incorporated in

</title> in the 1860 edition. If the note or title "Europe" suggests that Whitman might have first intended to divide his salutations into discrete sections based on the different continents, this is a plan he did
not follow in the published version(s). The more polished (but deleted) lines on the verso represent a recasting in poetic form of several lines from the 1855 Preface to

</title> after which the first verse drafted on this page (cut off here, and beginning "over the Texan, Mexican, Florid[ian,]/ Cuban seas...") was dropped. The two verses below this, however, were preserved

</title> (See the entry for
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">My picture gallery
</title> below.) But Whitman's early style of inscription in this draft, along with the line "It is round—it has room for America, north and south" and his use of his own name in the deleted first line, all
suggest that Whitman may have inscribed this draft around the same time that he was working on the new 1856
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Poem of Salutations
</title> (eventually
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Salut au Monde!

<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Poem of Salutations
</title> and the formally and thematically similar

            <p>These descriptions follow the present arbitrary but longstanding physical arrangement of the manuscripts, first collected in a series of folders, and now in two boxed binders. This arrangement groups
manuscripts according to their position in and out of the "clusters" comprising the 1860 edition of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves of Grass
</title>, although the 1860 order of the clusters themselves has not been followed by the collector who arranged the poems.

</title> and
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Fables
</title> (both 1871; see [Vol. 2, p. 163] and [Vol. 2, p. 164]) are included in the list by virtue of being housed with earlier poems in the second binder.
</p>
            <p>All of these poems except for
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Sparkles from the Wheel
</title> and
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Fables
</title> were published in the 1860 edition of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves of Grass.
</title> The manuscripts are generally followed by print versions of the poems disbound by a collector from the 1860 edition. Since Whitman apparently had no contact with the printed pages they have not been
described here. Neither have the annotations made by collectors on many of Whitman's leaves. The measurements given below are taken at the points of greatest height and width, in that order, for each page.
Following Fredson Bowers's practice in describing the manuscripts, the location of major pinhole clusters in each page, where present, has also been noted. (The pinholes, as Bowers argues, can yield helpful clues
as to Whitman's practices of revision. Intact pages have multiple pinholes in the middle; thus, pinholes at the top of a small page indicate that the fragment was removed from the lower section of a full leaf, and
vice versa). The types of paper and writing implements used by Whitman in each case have been documented for the same reasons. Since, in many cases, after 1860 Whitman changed the poems' titles and revised and
transferred them elsewhere, a brief narrative of each poem's post-1860 evolution accompanies its description.

</p>
            <p>The entry after the page numbers is the first autograph line at the top of the page. Beginning at page 34 of volume 1, the corresponding published poems are removed from 1860 edition and interleaved with the
manuscripts.

order. Each leaf is numbered consecutively by Whitman, in pencil, in the lower left corner. Each leaf is also stabbed in the left margin and punctured with numerous pinholes. Bowers has identified at least four
stages of revision based on the writing implements and ink used by Whitman to make his corrections: first pencil, then dark ink with a fine pen, once again pencil, and finally thin light-brown ink.

verses (beginning "[Boy of the] Mannahatta—boy of/ the prairies,...") below the cut. He then left a revised section of verses on the lower part of the leaf (beginning "Victory, union, faith, democracy,/

</title> in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Sequel to Drum-Taps</title> (1865-66); and the earliest draft in the Barrett collection of what would become section 23 of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Proto-Leaf</title> (deleted; see Vol. 1, p. 8 for an intermediate version of the section and Vol. 1, p. 12 for the last version before publication). The undeleted verse is upside-down relative to the deleted section. The recto verses became main section 9 of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Enfans d'Adam</title> in 1860, and were retitled <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Once I Pass'd Through a Populous City</title> in 1867.

</title></p>
              <p>These pages contain drafts of poems that would become main sections 1-2, 4, 7-18, 20-23, 25-27, 30-32, 34, and 36-45 of the
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Calamus
</title> cluster, which first appeared in the 1860 edition of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves of Grass.
</title> In 1867 the poems received individual titles, and in that and subsequent editions a small number of poems were removed from and added to the cluster; but, with the exceptions noted below, the great
majority of the original poems remained in
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Calamus
</title> through all the versions of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves
</title>. Twelve of the manuscript poems are taken from a small notebook and marked with ornamental Roman numerals, which Bowers used to reconstruct the original sequence upon which
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Calamus

                <p>This leaf comprises two sections of a poem inscribed (with very few alterations) on the first and third sides of a folded half-sheet (21.5 x 16 cm.) of the same white wove paper used for "Long I was held by the
life." Whitman also used the same light-brown ink for these passages as for [Long I was held by the life/ that exhibits itself,], and, as Bowers notes, the pinholes in the two leaves match up. On the first side of
the folded leaf a blue pencil was used to correct a pencil number 7 to a 1, and on the third side the blue pencil corrected a pencil 8 to a 2. The five verses beginning "Was it I who walked the/ earth..." were not
used in
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Calamus,
</title> but the five lines beginning "Scented herbage of my breast" became the opening verses of section 2 of the cluster in the 1860
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves
</title>. In the 1867 and later editions the first line was used as the title of the poem. See the following five entries for drafts of the remaining verses in the section, written on larger leaves (roughly 20 x
16 cm.) of the same paper, in darker ink, and all heavily revised.

erased pencil note "(finished in/ the other city)" appears on the first page. The ornamental number "VIII" replaces a deleted ornamental "IX" on the first page, and the top of another "IX" appears at the foot of
the second page, beneath a wavy line indicating the end of the poem. Whitman removed the lower section of page 2 from the top of current leaf Vol. 1, p. 132 ("I dreamed in a dream of a/ city..."). This poem, the

<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Calamus
</title> in 1860; the lines on the first draft page correspond to verses 2-8 and those on the second page ("Or as if interior in me") to verses 9-10. This was the first and last appearance of the poem during
Whitman's lifetime: he rejected it from his

              <p>On one composite leaf of pink paper formed of two sections (10 x 13 and 11.5 x 13 cm.) of the same page cut apart and pasted together in a new order. The poem number was originally 101 and then changed to 102;
this number was deleted and the current ?101 added in fine pen. Bowers explains that the poem, in two discrete verse sections and inscribed in black ink (with title), originally occupied one full side of this
leaf. When Whitman wanted to expand the first section without having to retranscribe the second one, he simply cut the two sections apart, flipped the first section over (turning it upside-down in the process),
pasted the second section to the lower edge of the verso of the first section, and wrote his new first section (beginning "Throwing far, throwing over the head/ of death" and incorporating the original title as
verse 3) in the blank space now created above the second section. The new first section is written and revised in light ink. As Bradley and Blodgett observe, the words "thirty-eight years old the/ eighty-first
year of The States" indicate that Whitman composed the poem in 1857; these were revised to read "I, forty years old the Eighty-third Year of The States" in the 1860

                <p>On sixteen leaves of pink paper, all basically the same size (21.5 x 13 cm.) and all in black ink, with a fair number of revisions in the same ink, in a darker ink, and in pencil. Multiple pinholes in the
center, and also some at the top, of each leaf. This poem was originally numbered 89. Whitman also numbered each leaf in the lower-left corner in pencil: the leaves follow the order 1-9, 9 1/2 (a full page despite
its number), and 10-15. The expression "the Eightieth year of/ These States" at the top of leaf 2 indicates, as Bradley and Blodgett note, that Whitman was working on this poem as early as 1856. It became section
4 of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Chants Democratic
</title> in 1860. In 1867 Whitman ungrouped it and retitled the poem

</title> a name it kept until being permanently retitled
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Our Old Feuillage
</title> in 1881. The lines on the manuscript leaves correspond to these verses in the 1860 edition: leaf 1 to verses 1-6; leaf 2 ("The area the Eightieth year of/ These States,...") to 7-12; leaf 3 ("Always The
West, with strong native/ persons,...") to 13-18; leaf 4 ("In their northerly wilds, beasts of/ prey...") to 19-24; leaf 5 ("On solid land what is done/ in cities...") to 25-29; leaf 6 ("Rude boats descending the

to 43-45; leaf 9 1/2 ("The Texas cotton-field and/ the negro-cabins—...") to 46-50; leaf 10 ("The drama of the scalp-dance") to 51-58; leaf 11 ("The country-boy at the close/ of the day...") to 59-61 and 63;
leaf 12 ("The athletic American matron") to 64-70; leaf 13 ("Otherways there, atwixt the banks/ of the Arkansaw,...") to 71-73; leaf 14 ("The migrating flock of wild-/geese...") to 74-75; and leaf 15 ("In the
Mannahatta, streets, piers,") to verses 76-77 and 79-83.

              <p>On six leaves of pink paper, the first a composite leaf measuring 25.5 x 12.5 cm. and the rest standard-sized leaves of 21.5 x 12.5 cm. In black ink, with extensive revisions in the same ink, in pencil, and,
finally, in light ink. Whitman also numbered each leaf, in pencil, in the upper right corner. Each leaf has a pinhole cluster in the center and a few holes in the left margin. The first leaf consists of an
expanded opening section (title and three verses) in light ink inscribed on a small section of pink paper (9.5 x 12.5 cm.) pasted to what Whitman left (18 x 12 cm.) of the original leaf after apparently excising
the original opening verse(s). The lower left corner of this first leaf, with part of two or three words, has been worn away. In the 1860 edition of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves
</title> Whitman published this poem as section 8 of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Chants Democratic.
</title> In 1867, Bradley and Blodgett note, he gave it the permanent title
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Song at Sunset
</title> and moved it to the supplement
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Songs Before Parting
</title>; in 1871 it was finally transferred to the cluster
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Songs of Parting
</title> within the main body of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves
</title>. The leaves correspond to the verses in the 1860
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Chants Democratic
</title> version as follows: leaf 1 to verses 1-12; leaf 2 ("Illustrious the yet shining light!") to verses 13-25; leaf 3 ("To speak! To walk! To/ seize something by the/ hand!") to verses 26-34; leaf 4 ("How the
water sports and/ sings!...) to verses 35-42; leaf 5 ("I too throb to the brain...") to verses 43-49; and leaf 6 ("As I roamed the streets of/ inland Chicago—...") to verses 50-59.

              <p>On two leaves of pink paper, in black ink, with heavy revisions in the same ink, in pencil, in fine pen (very black ink), and in light ink. With the fine pen Whitman inscribed and circled the note "2d/ piece/
in Book" in the upper-right corner of the first leaf. The first leaf is a standard page measuring 21.5 x 13 cm., while the second is a composite of two sections pasted together, the top section measuring 6 x 13
and the bottom one 18.5 x 12.5 cm. The small top section is inscribed in light ink on the verso of some deleted draft verses excised from
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">So Long!
</title> (see Vol. 2, pp. 153-159); Bowers observes that Whitman seems to have cut away the original first verse(s) in order to attach this expanded verse (in light ink) to the main body of original verses.
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Thought

</title> (This particular

with extensive revisions in the same ink, in fine pen, and in light ink. The paste-on revision is in light ink, and contains an expanded version of the original lines Whitman cut away and apparently discarded. The
verso of the paste-on section contains, as Bowers notes, five undeleted draft lines that would become the final verses of

was originally numbered 67, and the partly erased pencil note "Needs to be/ re-written/ or excluded" appears in the upper-right corner of the first leaf. Whitman also numbered the leaves in pencil in their lower-
left corners. The leaves correspond to verses in section 12 of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Chants Democratic

orators/ fit for America,") to verses 17-19; leaf 5 ("Of a great vocalism, when/ you hear it,...") to verses 20-26. After excising and altering numerous verses of the poem and numbering different verse paragraphs
for the
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Chants Democratic
</title> version, Whitman next made the poem the second numbered section of the last

<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">To Oratists.
</title> Then, in 1881, Whitman deleted several lines, joining this poem with a previously unconnected poem known as
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Voices

              <p>On three leaves of pink paper (the first cut down to 19.5 x 12.5 cm., the second two measuring 21.5 x 12.5 cm.), in black ink, with revisions in the same ink, in fine pen, in pencil, and in light ink (including
the title). A partial horizontal line at the top of the first leaf indicates that Whitman cut away the original title and number; Bowers notes that in a list of his poems Whitman refers to this poem as
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">38. Walt Whitman's Laws.
</title> Pinholes clustered mostly in center of each leaf, with some in the left margins and at least one pair in the upper right corner. Whitman numbered each leaf in pencil in the lower left corner. These pages
were transformed into section 13 of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Chants Democratic
</title> in the 1860
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves
</title> as follows: Leaf 1 to verses 1-6; Leaf 2 ("Statements, models, censuses,") to verses 7-12; Leaf 3 ("What do you suppose Creation/ is?") to verses 13-18. A pencil paragraph mark appears in the upper left
corner of the third leaf; the verses on it formed the third numbered sub-section of the poem in 1860. In 1867 it was greatly shortened and transferred to the final

</title> cluster in
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves

</title> Its final position was in the cluster

</title> Three earlier pencil drafts of most of the lines on Leaf 1 and some on Leaf 2 are housed under accession number 3829-i (see

                <p>On eighteen leaves of pink paper and two of white wove paper, numbered in pencil by a collector (in the upper-right corners), and described individually as follows. (See Bowers 196-215 for more details.) Leaf 1
(21.5 x 13 cm.): pink paper, in black ink, with revisions in the same ink, a blacker ink (the number 36), and the light revising ink. Multiple pinholes in center and left margin. Corresponds to verse paragraphs 1-
4 in the 1860 published version. Leaves 2-3 (21.5 x 13 cm.): pink paper, in black ink, with revisions in pencil, in blacker ink, and in the light ink. Multiple pinholes in center and left margin. Whitman penciled
in the numbers 56a and 56b at the top of the leaves, and also (possibly) a number 5 in the upper-left corner of leaf 2. These leaves correspond to verse paragraphs 5-8 and 9-12. Leaf 4 (21 x 13 cm.): pink paper
(21.5 x 13 cm.), in black ink, with revisions in the same ink and light ink. Originally titled
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Contact
</title> and inscribed, as Bowers notes, as if it were the beginning of a major independent poem. The final verse was deleted with pencil strokes, but these strokes were erased. Multiple pinholes in center and at
top. Corresponds to verse paragraphs 13-14 in the published version. Leaves 5-8 (all roughly 21 x 13 cm.): pink paper, in black ink, with revisions in pencil, in blacker ink, in fine pen (very black ink), and in
light ink. Multiple pinholes in center and at top. Leaves 5-7 bear the deleted pencil numbers 2-4 in the lower left corner; leaf 8 bears the undeleted number 5, as well as the pencil number 2 at the top. Leaf 7
has an undeleted pencil 1 in the same position, as well as Whitman's pencil note "Fifth Month" above the word "May" in the first line. These leaves correspond to verse paragraphs 14 through 16 (verses 1-3); 16
(verse 4) through 18 (verse 1); 18 (2-5) through 19 (1-2); and 19 (3-6) through 20. Leaves 9-10: pink paper (the first 21 x 13 cm., the second cut down to 14.5 x 13 cm.), in black ink, with revisions in fine pen
(very black ink), in pencil, and in light ink. The section excised from leaf 10 was pasted, as Bowers notes, to the foot of what is now leaf 12. Multiple pinholes in the (original) center and at the top of both
leaves. These leaves bear the deleted pencil numbers 6 and 6 1/2 (lower left corner) and the undeleted numbers 3 and 4 (at top). They correspond to verse paragraphs 21 through 23 (verses 1-3) and 23 (verses 4-8).
Leaves 11-12: white wove paper (both 20 x 15.5 cm., with a 7.5 x 13 cm. pink-paper section from leaf 10 pasted to leaf 12), in dark ink (thick pen), with revisions in the same ink, in pencil, and in light ink.
Multiple pinholes in center and at top. These leaves bear the deleted pencil numbers 15 and 16 (lower left corner) and the undeleted numbers 5-6 (at top). The lines inscribed on the white pages correspond to
verses 1-10 and 11-13 of verse paragraph 24; the three pink-paper verses correspond to paragraph 25. Leaves 13-14: pink paper (21 x 13 cm.), in black ink, with revisions in the same ink and fine pen. Multiple
pinholes in center and at top. These leaves bear the deleted pencil numbers 7-8 (lower left corner), and leaf 13 still carries the number 7 at the top. They correspond to verse paragraphs 26-27 (verse 1) and 27
(verses 2-6). Leaves 15-20: pink paper (all roughly 21 x 13 cm.), in black ink, with revisions in the same ink, in pencil, in fine pen (very black ink), and in light ink. Multiple pinholes in center and at top.
These leaves bear the deleted pencil numbers 14 and 9-13 (lower-left corner), although the number 11 on leaf 18 is undeleted. They correspond to verse paragraphs 28-29, 30-31, 32-34 (with a pencil X to the right
of the last lines on this leaf [leaf 17]), 35-36, 37-39, and 40-41.

ink, with revisions in the same ink, in pencil, in fine pen (very black ink), and in light ink. Corresponds exactly in terms of the number of lines used to the first page of the poem as published (under the title

revisions in the same ink, in pencil, and in the fine pen (very black ink). Corresponds to sections 3 (verses 7-8) through 7 (verse 1) in the 1860 version. Leaf 3 ("Once more I proclaim the whole of/ America..."):
plain leaf (15 x 9 cm.), in medium-black ink, with revisions in the same ink and in pencil. Corresponds to sections 7 (verse 2) through 10, along with section 12, in the 1860 version. On the verso appear two
deleted sections, comprising nine verses (beginning "Yet, old throat, one loud/ cadenza!") revised from the bottom of original leaf 4, which Whitman compressed and reversed on the leaf 4 paste-on to eventually
form sections 15 and 16 in the published version. Leaf 4 ("I announce the continued union of/ The States,"): composite leaf measuring 15 x 9 cm., with a faded blue paste-on of 5.5 x 9 cm. covering several water-
damaged and heavily revised verses on the original leaf. In medium-black ink, with revisions in the same ink, in a slightly browner ink (thicker pen), in pencil, in fine pen, and in light ink. Corresponds to
sections 11 and 13-16 of the 1860 version. Leaf 5 ("Screaming electric, the atmosphere using,"): plain leaf (15 x 9 cm.), in medium-black ink, with revisions in the same ink, in pencil, and in light ink.

six paste-ons in light ink and black ink, and with heavy revisions in the same inks and in pencil. The final paste-on corresponds to sections 18-20 of the 1860 version, but the other paste-ons and the original
leaf contain drafts for the rest of the poem (sections 21-23). Leaf 7 ("O how your fingers drowse me!"): full leaf (15 x 9 cm.) with two paste-ons, the first a large section (13 x 9 cm.) of the same blue paper and
the second a small section (6.5 x 10.5 cm.) of white wove paper. The white paste-over is inscribed in light ink with no revisions; the blue paste-over is inscribed in medium-black ink, with extensive revisions in
pencil and in the same ink, as with the deleted verses on the original page. The white paste-on corresponds to section 21 in the 1860 version, and the blue paste-on contains the latest draft of what would become
sections 22 and 23. In 1860 this was the final poem in

<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Kansas Magazine
</title>, after which Whitman published it in the 1872 book
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free
</title>, in
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Two Rivulets
</title> (1876), and in the 1881 edition of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves of Grass
</title>. There and in later editions of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves
</title> the poem was included in the cluster
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">From Noon to Starry Night.
</title> Leaf 1: on the verso of a sheet of laid, gray-ruled Department of Justice letterhead, dated "Washington...187[ ]" (see leaves 2 and 8). Inscribed in black ink, with extensive revisions first in pencil and
then in black ink. This is a later draft than leaf 2 of verses that would eventually constitute the first numbered section of the poem. Whitman's number "1" appears in orange crayon in the upper right corner of
the leaf. Leaf 2 ("Hark! some wild trumpeter—some/ strange musician!"): also on the verso (upside-down) of a leaf of the same Department of Justice letterhead. Inscribed in black ink, with heavy revisions in
the same ink, then in pencil and in fine pen (original ink?). Whitman deleted most of the lines, drafting them again and shifting many of them around on leaf 1. Leaf 3 ("Come nearer mystic/ trumpeter"): on a
composite leaf formed by pasting a small section (8 x 12 cm.) of unruled laid paper to a full sheet of laid paper, ruled in gray on recto. Inscribed in black ink, with extensive revisions in the same ink and in
pencil. After further revision these verses became section 2 of the published version. Leaf 4 ("Blow, trumpeter, free and clear—I/ follow thee,"): on a leaf of laid paper, gray-ruled on recto (see 6-7).
Inscribed in black ink, with revisions in the same, in pencil, and in orange crayon. Whitman's orange-crayon note "Serenity—cool fresh/ placidity—" runs lengthwise up the left margin to the top of the
page. After further revision these verses became section 3 of the published version. Leaf 5 ("Blow again trumpeter—and let/ the notes swell high,"): on one leaf of white wove paper, ruled in blue on verso.
Three sets of pinholes appear in the upper left corner. Inscribed in black ink, with revisions in the same. This is an early draft of lines Whitman would revise and expand in Leaf 6 to eventually form section 4 in
the published version. Leaf 6 ("Blow again, trumpeter, and/ for my sensuous eyes"): on the same paper as leaves 4 and 7. Inscribed partly in black ink and partly in pencil; the ink section is revised in the same
ink, in pencil, and in pink ink; the pencil section is revised in pencil, in brown-black ink (fine pen), and in pink ink. The pencil lines are written below the pencil note "see last part of Consuelo vol 5th," by
which Whitman apparently meant the novel
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Consuelo
</title> by George Sand, a book from which he made frequent borrowings. This was a later draft of lines on leaf 7; the number "4" appears in orange crayon at the top of the leaf. Leaf 7 ("Blow again, trumpeter
and/ bring before me now,"): on a leaf of the same paper as leaves 4 and 6. Inscribed in black ink, with revisions in the same, in brown ink, and in pink ink. At the foot of the leaf Whitman wrote the
parenthetical note "(see last vol. of Consuelo)" with a cartoon hand pointing to it; at this point he revised the ink lines on leaf 6, consulted
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Consuelo
</title>, and drafted his new pencil verses on the other leaf. Leaf 8 ("Blow again trumpeter and/ for thy theme..."): on the verso of a leaf of Department of Justice letterhead (see leaves 1-2), inscribed in black
ink, with revisions in pink ink and then black ink. The pink ink was mostly applied with a broader nib here than in earlier leaves. Whitman's note "the piece must move on/ not lag/ sentimental" runs up the left
margin to the top of the page. These trial verses, many of them incomplete, were revised to form section 5 in the published version of the poem. Leaf 9 ("Blow again trumpeter/ and give/ for me/ now/ Thy war notes'
magic spell"): on a leaf of white wove paper, blue-ruled on verso. Multiple pinholes in the center-left portion of the leaf. Inscribed and revised in black ink. In the lower right corner of the leaf appears a
cryptic blue-crayon note in Whitman's hand: "Hah!"

            <p>On the verso of a light blue Williamsburgh (N.Y.) tax form, dated "185[ ]," cut down to 20 x 12 cm. The corners are cropped diagonally. Multiple pinholes in center. Inscribed in pencil and revised in pencil and
brown-black ink (fine pen). Two sets of deleted verses constitute adaptations of lines from Whitman's pre-1855 unpublished notebook
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Pictures
</title>: "Now this is the fable of the/ mirror:/ The mirror lay clouded, (enveloped)/ enmisted," and "And/ Now this is the fable of a/ beautiful statue:/ A beautiful statue was lost/ but not destroyed[.]" Two
other deleted titles of fables(?) appear above the verses: "The trained runner" and "The five old men." At the foot of the leaf appears the note "last piece/ (still another Death Song—/ Death Song/ with
prophecies[.]" All of the sections are demarcated with horizontal lines. Based on Whitman's use of the tax blank, this appears to be a set of notes he made between 1857 and 1859 while preparing the 1860 edition of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves of Grass

</title> contained in red bound volume measuring 26 cm. x 18 cm. Revisions are made in ink and pencil on printed edition of the poem. Walt Whitman apparently used two volumes to tear the leaves from, as every
other page is slightly smaller than the rest; revisions are made only on the recto side of each leaf, verso is crossed out. Several leaves are cut apart and pasted in new order on other leaves or on lined paper.
Leaf 8 is a handwritten MS.

<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves of Grass
</title>, that became (as Bradley and Blodgett note)
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Poem of Walt Whitman, an American
</title> in the 1856 edition and

<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Song of Myself.
</title> (Leaves apparently unrelated to the
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Song
</title> are included in this description by virtue of being bound with
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Song
</title> drafts.) Generally the dating is quite early. All but three of the leaves were at one point in the possession of Whitman's executor Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke, who transcribed them (often with significant
errors or verses later removed from these fragments) in
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Notes and Fragments: Left by Walt Whitman...
</title> (1899) and his 1902 edition of the

</title>; page numbers to his transcriptions in
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Notes
</title> are provided with each relevant entry here. Although Whitman used a wide range of paper-types for these fragments, five kinds of paper can be identified. These are assigned letters as follows. Type A:
off-white notebook paper with light brown vertical lines running up the left and right margins, three on one side and one on the other. See Leaves 1, 8, 12, 20, and 28. A full leaf of the notebook paper seems to
have measured 19 x 15.5 cm. Type B: white wove paper, ruled in light blue-gray on both sides. See Leaves 3, 5, 21-22, and 27. No full sheet of this paper is present in the volume. Type C: light blue laid
Williamsburgh (N.Y.) tax forms, dated "185[ ]," and used extensively by Whitman in preparing his 1860 edition of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves and Grass.
</title> Described by Fredson Bowers in his work on the 1860
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves
</title>-related Barrett manuscripts also listed and described above. A full tax form measures 21.5 x 12 cm. See Leaves 4 and 34. Type D: yellow and green wove proof sheets used, it seems, for trial printings of
the title page of the first edition of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves of Grass.
</title> See Leaves 7, 24-25, and 30-31. Type E: white laid paper ruled in brown on both sides. See Leaves 9-11, 13, 15-16, and 23. The dimensions of a full leaf of the paper cannot be determined from these
fragments.

(as Bucke transcribes it), providing closure to these particular verses, or it could just as easily read "an," indicating that a continuation of the lines has been lost. Although never published verbatim, these

</title> Another version became an unnumbered section (beginning "I will take an egg out of the robin's nest in the orchard,") of the poem

"Priests!/ Until you can explain a paving stone, do not try to explain God...," reprinted by Bucke on p. 89, and to the concluding lines of the 1855 poem that would eventually (in 1881) become

inscribed in brown ink, extensively revised in the same ink and in pencil deletion. After heavy revision and expansion they eventually formed part of section 21 of the cluster

verso and recto, respectively; these numbers, along with remnants of paste and binding tape along the left margin of the recto, suggest that the type A pages came from a notebook. The lines on the recto are
inscribed, revised, and deleted (with a single stroke) in pencil, and appear on the verso of undeleted notes inscribed and revised in brown-black ink with some revisions in pencil. The verso notes begin with a
list of animals and plants ("cottonwood—mulberry—/chickadee—large brown water-dog"), followed by a verse ("The suicide/ went to a lonesome place...") that Whitman revised for use ("The suicide
sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,") in what would eventually constitute section 8 of

</title> This verse is followed by another section of the natural "catalogue" ("locust, birch/ cypress..."), below which appears a pair of verses (beginning "O dirt, you corpse—I reckon you are good
manure—") used in what would be section 48 of the

                <p>On a leaf of type E laid paper (18.5 x 17.5 cm.) with three corners cropped for mounting. Multiple pinholes in center. Inscribed and revised on both sides in pencil. A comparison of Whitman's revisions between
leaves indicates that this was probably the second of the four
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Lucifer
</title> drafts, written before he decided to merge his commentary on slavery with allusions to the fallen angel of Isaiah. The trial lines on the verso (beginning "His very aches are exstasy") seem to have been
revised for inclusion in what is now section 29 of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Song of Myself.
</title> Whitman's unusual spelling of "ecstasy" indicates not only that the lines came very early in the process of writing
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves
</title>, but that these lines may have originally been part of the proto-
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Song of Myself
</title> before being transferred to what would become
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">The Sleepers.
</title> The verso lines and the words "I am a curse" link this leaf, like leaves 10 and 11, to two sections of draft verses in the earliest Library of Congress notebook (#80) beginning "Fierce wrestler!" and "I
am a curse:" (see p. 77 of Grier's

first line reads "I am a hell-name and a Curse..." This seems to have been the last of the four

</title>. The word "Sleepchaser's" appears in the upper right corner, perhaps indicating that Whitman was considering a title similar to the 1860 and 1867 title
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Sleep-Chasings
</title> even before the poem was first published in 1855, unless this is in fact a reworking of the section for the 1860 edition. The possibility of a post-1855 dating, however, appears to be slight given the
similarities of paper choice and inscription techniques among leaves 9-11 and their shared similarities to drafts in the earliest Library of Congress notebook.

(in the center) indicate that this was originally the lower section of a full leaf, although the excision patterns along the top edge of this leaf and the lower edge of Leaf 10 do not seem to match up. This leaf,
a reworking of the lines beginning "I am a Curse" in Library of Congress notebook #80, with verses added from Leaf 9, appears to have come third in the revision process. The only line specifically linking the poem
to the theme of slavery ("I look off the river with my bloodshot eyes, after/ the steamboat that carries away my woman.—"), adapted from Leaf 9, is deleted, and Whitman apparently rejected these lines and
the "curse" theme in general as he moved towards the draft on Leaf 10, which would eventuate in the 1855 published version. On the verso (upside-down) appear two sets of trial verses for what would eventually
become the second verse paragraph of section 4 of the poem

horns.—" and the second draft begins "I stand at the top of the street[.]" Bucke prints these verses on pp. 19-20.

The laid paper was originally the last page of a letter; a few illegible words and part of a signature can be seen dimly through the back of the composite leaf. Whitman wrote his lines on the verso of the page
after turning it sideways. Although Whitman did not use the verses word for word, they may have been part of an early draft of the fourth poem in the 1855 edition of

margin points to the phrase "religious emotions." Whitman's use of the title
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Calamus Leaves
</title> dates these notes to the same pre-1860 period as the deleted verses on the recto, since

be a later draft of the upper set, even though Bucke prints them in reverse order and as separate fragments on p. 32 of

be in Whitman's hand. This may indeed have been a draft of the poem

pencil, and on the verso in light brown ink and pencil. The verso lines (beginning "[sl]ueing,/...[be]nding,/...halt in the shade,") represent a fragment of a polished pre-1855-publication draft—almost a
fair copy, but with interesting revisions nonetheless—of lines that would eventually belong in section 13 of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Song of Myself.
</title> These verses are inscribed along the ruled lines. Whitman cannibalized this leaf at some point after 1855 to jot down the recto verses perpendicular to the ruled lines. These seem to constitute a complete
but very early draft of the poem

</title> (For a later draft see Leaf 28, and for an even later version inscribed shortly before the 1860 publication see 2:3:1 in
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves of Grass
</title> [1860].) In the upper right corner of the recto appear the words "note/ last page of 'Ghost-seers'" in Whitman's hand, suggesting that he had considered forming a cluster under this title, never
published, in
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves

              <p>On a section of white laid letter(?) paper (10.5 x 19.5 cm.) folded in two places, perhaps for mailing. All four corners are cropped, and the right margin is cut irregularly. No pinholes. Inscribed in black ink
that has bled in several places from contact with water drops. A long horizontal line divides the first set of draft verses from a pair of trial verses beginning "The railroads with their hundreds/ of lines..."
Although these poetic notes are difficult to date, they may represent an intermediate stage between the 1855 Preface to

republishing Bucke's transcription (still in prose form) Grier reports, on p. 1941 of the

that one or more verses were cut away and discarded; this is corroborated by the fact that the final word, "gaunt," ends not with a period but with a comma. Whitman's use of the tax form and the strong similarity
this fragment bears (as Bradley and Blodgett note) both to the 1856

larger set before Whitman decided to make them an independent poem, adding a hyphen at the end of the last line and cutting off the verses below. (The word "nothing" in the last line was partly cut away as well.)
Although written in free verse, the rather conventional nature of this poem suggests an early date of inscription. Bucke does not transcribe it.

smudged with erased words, and largely worn away—has been reinforced with a strip of light brown wove paper pasted to the verso. Inscribed in pencil, with one minor revision in brown ink. The leaf is divided
with horizontal lines into four sections: "Pentameter," "Anapest," "Dithyrambus/ Dithyramb/ Dithyrambic," and "Caesura." Like the contents of the verso of Leaf 14, these notes represent a version of the poetic

            <p>These two manuscripts represent different stages, earlier and later, in the evolution of a poem written during October and November 1873 and first published as
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Song of the Redwood-Tree
</title> in the February 1874 issue of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Harper's Magazine
</title>. From a note prefacing the first manuscript, as Bowers writes, it appears that Whitman personally took charge of gathering and preserving the manuscripts. In 1876, Bradley and Blodgett observe, Whitman
published the poem in the independent group
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Centennial Songs
</title> and in this group as annexed to
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Two Rivulets

              <physdesc>AMsS rough draft, 20 leaves, handwritten, 11 x 12.5 cm. to 22.5 x 17.5 cm., #3829 (Bowers #12).

              <p>This rough draft begins with the following note, inscribed and initialed by Whitman in brown-black ink, on one piece (17.5 x 22.5 cm.) of thin, light brown wove paper with no pinholes: "Camden,/ Oct. &amp; Nov.
'73./ Song of the Redwood Tree./ (rough draft—mems,/ printed sketch,/ letter from Harper's Mag.)/ &amp;c./ W. W." The other leaves are described individually as follows. Unless noted otherwise, each leaf
features multiple pinholes in its center. Leaf 2 ("Song of the Redwood/ Tree/ &amp; other pieces"): white wove paper (20.5 x 12.5 cm.), apparently a flyleaf or blank page removed from a book. The undeleted title
as well as the deleted titles
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Eidólons
</title> (on both recto and verso, but upside-down relative to the undeleted title) and
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Waves in the Vessel's Wake
</title> (also upside-down) are inscribed in blue crayon, while the line "Waves, undulating/ waves—" (on verso, upside-down) is in grey-black ink.
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Eidólons
</title> was the title Whitman used for a poem first published in 1876; and
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Waves in the Vessel's Wake,
</title> according to Bradley and Blodgett, was an alternate title for a poem eventually named
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">After the Sea-Ship,
</title> in which the line "Waves, undulating/ waves—" can be found. Leaf 3 (
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">A California song./ Song of the Redwood/ Tree
</title>): white wove paper (20 x 12.5 cm.), ruled on both sides. The page contains four sections of pencil notes in prose and verse, with the title
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">A California song
</title> (which became the first verse of the published poem) in medium black ink, and the second title, along with notes dating the second section to "Oct. '73" and the third section to "Nov. '73/ Camden," in
blue crayon. In pencil Whitman also drew a cartoon hand pointing to the sentence "Use this point to express/ fully my California views" in the second section. Leaf 4 ("A mighty tree is/ falling."): white wove
paper (20.5 x 13 cm.), ruled on recto. In pencil (on recto), with extensive pencil revisions. The verses on this leaf represent an early draft of numbered sections 1 and 2 of the published poem. On the verso
(perpendicular to the recto verses) appear notes, deleted in pencil, for "(a sonnet)" written "for Century Verses," which appears from a Library of Congress manuscript to have been a working title of the group
that became
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Centennial Verses
</title> in 1876. After heavy revision (see verso of leaf 5) the poem became the title-page epigraph to the 1876 (
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Come, said my Soul
</title>) and several later editions of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leaves</title>. The incomplete verso lines are in brown black ink with extensive revisions in the same ink. Leaf 5: on the same type of paper as 4, torn down to 20.5 x 13 cm. Recto is inscribed and extensively revised
in pencil; these verses represent an early draft of section 3 of the published poem. On the verso ("Go said my Soul, the real Me,") appears a deleted later draft of the poem whose notes appear on the verso of Leaf
4. The verso lines are inscribed in brown-black ink with extensive revisions in the same ink, in blue crayon, and in pencil, apparently in that order. Leaf 6 ("So for a type for you, your/ race, Pacific lands"):
white laid paper (20.5 x 12.5 cm.), ruled on verso. Inscribed in pencil and medium black pen, with heavy revisions in both of these, particularly the pencil, and in light ink. Whitman inscribed the pencil note
"last," enclosed in a semicircle, in the upper right corner. After further revision these verses became the last italicized verse paragraph of section 4 of the 1876 version of the poem. Leaf 7 ("(The teamsters,
choppers, chain/ and jackscrew men/ heard not...)"): White quadrille paper (21 x 13.5 cm.), at one point folded in thirds. Inscribed and extensively revised in pencil. These lines were further revised to form the
second and third verse paragraphs of section 2 in the 1876 version of the poem. Leaf 8 ("Lands of the Western shore!"): inscribed in medium black ink on the verso of p. [1] of a letter (18 x 11 cm.) cut from a fold
of what Bowers characterizes as fine tinted laid paper. The verses are inscribed perpendicular to the sentences of the letter. Revised in the main ink and in a lighter ink. These verses were further revised to
form the closing section (6) of the 1876 version of the poem. The letter, deleted in blue crayon, is dated "Boston./ 96 Washington St/ 30 Sept '73" and was written by Boston lawyer Albert B. Otis. In it, Otis
expresses his happiness on learning that Whitman's health is improving, thanks him for sending a paper with news of the recovery, and mentions his wish to obtain copies of Whitman's new works as they appear.
Whitman used the verso of the second part of the letter as Leaf 3 of the second manuscript of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Song of the Redwood-Tree
</title> (see below). Leaf 9 ("The Cascade range/ On the Pacific—..."): white wove paper (20.5 x 13 cm.), ruled on both sides, with (as Bowers notes) the embossed device of Mercury's winged hat and a
caduceus in the upper left corner. Whitman began writing a letter on this page before using it for verse: deleted lines at the top read "431 Stevens st./ cor West" and "Camden,/ Saturday forenoon/ Oct. 25." These
trial verses are inscribed in the same medium brown ink as the letter heading, except for the final verse, which appears finished and is written in black ink. Revisions are in the main ink and in a lighter ink.
After further revision these verses were incorporated in sections 4 and 5 of the 1876 version of the poem. Leaf 10 ("As of the wood-spirits'/ voices ancient, rustly, speaking,"): inscribed on the same paper as
Leaf 9, with the same embossed device (reversed, in upper right corner), in medium black ink, with revisions in the same ink and in light ink and the first and last sections deleted. The top deleted section
includes several false starts, along with the draft line "A new Man/ and a new empire" in the upper right corner. The undeleted verses were revised to form part of section 4 in the 1876 version of the poem. Leaf
11 ("Farewell/ My time has ended, my term has/ come,—"): on the same paper as Leaf 6, also in pencil, with extensive revisions and deletions in the same. Only the verse quoted here was allowed to stand; it
was used as the final line of section 1 in the 1876 version of the poem. Leaf 12 ("or chorus of dryads, fading, departing"): inscribed on the verso of a letter (22.5 x 17.5 cm.) from Whitman family friend Abby H.
Price to Whitman's sister-in-law Mrs. George (Louisa Orr) Whitman. The letter and verses are on blue-tinted wove paper. Whitman's lines run perpendicular to the letter's, and are in brown-black ink, with revisions
in the same. Multiple pinholes at top and bottom of Whitman's verses rather than in center. The first verse became part of section 1 in the 1876 version, and the rest of the verses on the leaf were revised to form
section 5. The letter is written in brown-black ink (deleted with a blue crayon stroke), and is dated "New York. Oct 17th." In it, Abby Price tells Louisa Whitman of her dismay in reading newspaper reports that
Walt Whitman "'is...dangerously ill'" and asks her for more news. Leaf 13 ("Thus on the northern coast/ in the lumber-men's camp"): on white laid paper (20.5 x 15 cm.), ruled on both sides, inscribed in brown-
black ink and pencil, with extensive revisions and notes from Whitman to himself in the same. After further revision these lines became the final verse paragraph of section 4 in the 1876 version of the poem. Leaf
14 ("Nor these alone—not dedicate to these/ alone,..."): inscribed on the verso of a letter dated 1873 October 15 (21 x 12.5 cm.) to Whitman from his friend Charley [Eldridge]. On white laid paper, ruled on both sides, and
embossed with the letters "P &amp; P" (inside a decorative border) in the upper left corner. In medium-black ink, with three false starts, a paragraph mark, and revisions in the same. Whitman's lines run
perpendicular to the letter's. After further revision these lines were incorporated in the first few verses of section 6 of the 1876 version of the poem. In the letter, dated "Washington Oct 15. 1873" and deleted
with a single blue crayon stroke, Eldridge reports collecting various articles of Whitman's clothing, with Whitman's companion Peter Doyle, from a room the poet kept in Washington, D.C., and sending them via Adams
Express. Leaf 15 ("(Surely I did not dream)"): on white wove paper (20 x 12.5 cm.), ruled on both sides, and embossed in one corner with the die of the Juniata Mills, Pennsylvania. Inscribed in medium black ink,
with revisions in the same. These trial verses were revised and expanded to become the final italicized verse paragraph of section 3 of the 1876 version of the poem. Leaf 16 ("The influences of nature,"): on white
wove paper (19.5 x 12.5 cm.), ruled on recto. In pencil, with extensive revisions in the same. These verses were further revised and incorporated in the final italicized paragraph of section 4 in the 1876 version
of the poem. Leaf 17 ("The tree prophecies"): on a section of white laid paper (torn down to 15.5 x 12 cm.) embossed with what appears to be the same paper-maker's die as leaf 14, but only ruled on recto.
Inscribed and revised in pencil. The pinholes are positioned near the top of the leaf. These trial verses express the themes of much of the finished poem. Leaf 18 ("The spinal idea of/ the poem"): on white wove
paper (19.5 x 12 cm.), ruled on both sides. Inscribed and revised in pencil. This combination of prose and poetic notes provides an overview of the entire poem. Leaf 19 ("...or seemed to say"): on white wove paper
(19 x 12 cm.), ruled on both sides. Inscribed and revised in pencil. These verses were further revised and incorporated in sections 3 and 4 of the published poem in 1876. Leaf 20 ("Lessons to the/ race to grow"):
on a fragment of white wove paper torn down to 11 x 12.5 cm., ruled on verso. Inscribed in pencil. Pinholes at foot of fragment, i.e., in the center of the original page, and in the current center. These trial
verses provide an outline of most of the italicized passages (representing the Redwood's voice) in the published poem.

              <p>Leaves described individually as follows. Unless otherwise noted, pinholes are clustered at the center of each leaf. Whitman also numbered each leaf in blue crayon in the upper right corner of the page. Leaf 1:
on a composite leaf made of two fragments (12.5 x 19 and 5.5 x 12.5 cm.) of different kinds of white laid paper (the bottom fragment ruled on recto, the top not ruled) pasted together. The top set of verses is
inscribed in brown-black ink and revised in pencil and in the original ink; the bottom lines are inscribed in pencil, with revisions in the brown-black ink. Whitman numbered this section in blue crayon. Pinholes
in center of each part of the composite leaf. With a small amount of further revision this leaf became section 1 of the published poem. Leaf 2 ("Along the northern coast,"): on a leaf of white laid paper torn down
to 12.5 x 19.5 cm.; the watermark "[HAND?]MADE" is partly visible. On the back appear pencil notes in Whitman's hand for a letter regarding a painting or photograph of Whitman(?); this draft letter is deleted in
blue crayon. The verses are inscribed in brown-black ink, with revisions in the same ink, in pencil, and in blue crayon. Whitman also numbered this section in blue crayon. After a small amount of further revision
these lines became the first verse paragraph of section 2 in the published version. Leaf 3 ("The choppers haply heard not—the/ camp-shanties echoed not,"): on the verso of p. [2] (17.5 x 11 cm.)
of the Albert B. Otis letter, 1873 September 30, used for leaf 8 of the rough draft manuscript (see above); this part of the letter is also deleted with a blue crayon stroke. The verses are inscribed in medium black ink, with
revisions in the same ink and in pencil. After further revision they became the second and third verse paragraphs of section 2 in the published version. Leaf 4 ("You untold life of me,"): on three sections of
unruled white laid paper from the same page (15 x 13, 5.5 x 13, and 6 x 13 cm.) joined by means of two irregular fragments of white ruled paper pasted to the back. The ruled fragments contain ink and pencil notes
for the poem, but at a very early stage of development. The recto verses are inscribed in medium black ink and revised in the same ink, in pencil, and in blue crayon. Whitman also numbered this section 3 in blue
crayon: it became the first verse paragraph of that section in the 1876 version. In pencil, he added the note "ital" in the upper left corner and underlined almost every verse to indicate that the Tree's voice
should be printed in italics. As Bowers notes, Whitman cut up and rearranged this page to reverse the order of the lines on the second and third sections of paper. Leaf 5 ("N[or yie]ld we mournfully, majestic
brothers,"): on a composite leaf formed of two sections of paper pasted together; the top section (10 x 15 cm.), damaged along the top edge, is of the same kind of paper used for leaf 13 of the rough draft and
leaves 8 and 9 of this draft, and the bottom section (18.5 x 13 cm.) is of white wove paper, ruled on one side. The verses are inscribed in brown-black ink with heavy revisions in the same ink and in pencil. After
further revision these sections became the second and third verse paragraphs, respectively, of section 3 of the poem. Leaf 6 ("Then to a loftier strain/ Still prouder, more extatic rose/ the chant,"): on two
sections of different kinds of white paper, the lower section (20 x 12.5 cm.; wove, ruled on one side) being pasted to the top one (10 x 13 cm.; laid, unruled). The lower section is inscribed on the verso of part
of a sheet of Department of Justice letterhead with the dateline "Washington...187[ ]," under which Whitman jotted down and deleted directions to the Hydropathic Institute in Wernersville (Pennsylvania) in blue
crayon. He also used blue crayon to designate the verses section 4, of which they became the first two paragraphs in the published version. The verses are inscribed in brown-black ink, with heavy revisions in the
same and in pencil. Whitman added the note "ital" after joining the two paper sections, and concomitantly underlined each verse of the lower section for the same reasons as in leaf 4. Leaf 7 ("You occult, deep
volitions"): on white wove paper (25.5 x 20 cm.), ruled on both sides. Inscribed in medium black ink, with revisions in the same, in pencil, and (possibly) in a lighter ink. The upper right corner is damaged,
leaving the leaf number partially missing, but it seems clear that the number was a 7. As Bowers notes, the deleted title
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">You occult, deathless, deep volitions
</title> indicates that this was once an independent poem (as the existence of an early draft of the lines at Duke University would seem to confirm), but Whitman revised and italicized the lines—the note
"ital" and underlinings in pencil also appear here—for inclusion as the third paragraph of section 4 in the published version of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Song of the Redwood-Tree.
</title> Leaf 8 ("For you, for man of you your characteristic race,"): on a section (21 x 16 cm.) of the same kind of paper used for leaves 5 (in part) and 9; inscribed in medium black ink, with extensive
revisions in the same, in pencil, and in what seems to be a lighter ink. The verses are all underlined in the lighter ink(?) using a fine pen. At the bottom of the leaf appear the words "Idaho, Utah" in blue
crayon. After further revision these lines became the fourth verse paragraph, and the final italicized one, of section 4 in the published version of the poem. Leaf 9 ("Thus on the northern coast,"): on a section
(20.5 x 16 cm.) of the same kind of paper used for leaves 5 (in part) and 8; inscribed in medium black ink, with revisions in the same ink, in a lighter ink, and in pencil. The number 5 appears at the top of the
leaf, obscured by the addition of new lines. In actuality these verses became the final paragraph of section 4 in the published version of the poem. Leaf 10 ("The flashing &amp; golden pageant of California,"): on
a section of white laid paper (21 x 20 cm.), in brown-black ink, with extensive revisions in the same ink, in a lighter ink, and in pencil. The blue-crayon section number 6 appears next to a deleted pencil 2 at
the top of the leaf; at the bottom appears the ink note "? Yosemite" separated from the lines with a semicircle. These verses were further revised to form section 5 of the published version. Leaf 11 ("But more in
you, than these, I see, lands of the western shore!"): on three sections of white wove paper (top: 7 x 20 cm., unruled; middle: 8 x 19.5 cm., unruled; foot: 10 x 20.5 cm., ruled) pasted together and jointly pasted
to a paper fragment (6.5 x 20 cm.) containing an earlier, deleted set of verses that are revised in the current top section. The top and concealed sections are both inscribed on the verso of fragments of a letter,
written in purple ink and deleted by Whitman in blue crayon, from the engraver W. J. Linton. As Bradley and Blodgett note, Linton produced a portrait of Whitman that the poet included in
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Two Rivulets
</title> and that also inspired the poem
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Out from Behind This Mask.
</title> In what remains of the letter Linton inquires after Whitman's health. The verses on this composite leaf were revised to form the sixth and final section of the published version of the poem.

</title> comprises very early notes for a projected poem that Whitman inscribed in a handmade notebook (20.5 x 13 cm.). This he made by folding in half seven leaves of white laid Philp &amp; Solomon (Washington,
D.C.) paper (measuring 25 x 19.5 cm. unfolded), ruled in blue on both sides (type A), in the direct middle of which he inserted a gathering of three folded leaves of a different kind of white laid paper (type B),
ruled horizontally in blue on both sides, but also featuring a single vertical rule in blue and red. This gathering is held together with a metal bracket, and is bound in with the main notebook pages by means of a
pink ribbon. Three sections of type B paper are also tipped in between bound type A pages. Inscribed and revised in black ink, in pencil, and in blue crayon. Although Whitman never finished or published
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">The Soul's Procession
</title> during his lifetime, Bradley and Blodgett note that the same ideas worked out here inform many of his poems, particularly the 1871 independent publication
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Passage to India.
</title> For a transcription of the notebook with comprehensive annotations see Grier's
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts
</title>, vol. 4, pp. 1390-94. The earliest dating of the notebook is supplied by an 1869 newspaper clipping pasted to Leaf 3, but Grier speculates, based on the shakiness of Whitman's handwriting in later leaves,
that some of the notes may have been added after the poet suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1873. On the back cover appear pencil notes detailing train numbers, times, and (apparently) amounts of money.

to the lower left section of Leaf 3. The trial verse "My ship sails the sea/ in a storm" appears at the end of Whitman's prose notes and beneath the clipping, which documents the near-sinking of a steamship in the
Atlantic during a "furious gale." Inscribed in black ink, with a short horizontal line separating the note "In Soul's Procession" from the rest of the notes.

            <p>On one leaf of white wove paper (22.5 x 13.5 cm.), in very dark brown-black ink, with revisions in the same ink and in pencil. Multiple pinholes just below center. At the top, which is damaged, can be seen a
title or notes for a different poem reading
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">[One?] Song—Come Philander
</title>; the preliminary and incomplete draft of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Three verses
</title> (with the note "2d or 3d verse" and a question mark at different points) appears beneath a horizontal line. Whitman apparently never revised the poem further, and it was never published. At some point the
leaf was folded in half, apparently to form part of a small notebook. On the verso appear two independent texts. One is a list of names and addresses (beginning with his brother and sisters "Jeff./ Mary/ Han[nah]"
and including his friends and supporters Mrs. [Anne Burrows] Gilchrist, W[illiam] M[ichael] Rossetti, and [Edward] Dowden) of people to whom Whitman had apparently mailed copies of an article or book; all but two
of the names are checked off in ink or in orange crayon. On the facing half-leaf, in pencil (mostly erased or deleted) and struck through with the same orange crayon, appear what seem to be notes for a newspaper
announcement, beginning "Walt Whitman, after an absence of almost three years, appeared again on Pennsylvania Avenue this forenoon." Based on this date it can be speculated that the notes were written late in 1875
(a possibility corroborated by the list of names), but the poem(s) may have been inscribed in the late 1860s or earlier.

appears on the verso of the second, above the date "187[ ]." Both pages are inscribed in black ink, with revisions in the same and in brown-black ink. The first two entries on Leaf 1 appear to contain general
notes for this poem; the second entry reads, "Make a demand for/ the Ideal, (or/ rather idea of the/ Ideal of the real)." This is followed by the note "in the piece," which leads up to several trial verses
eventually incorporated in the second verse paragraph of numbered section 5 of
