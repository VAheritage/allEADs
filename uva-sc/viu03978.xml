            <p>Some entries for literary manuscripts include the "Bowers" number, originally assigned by Fredson Bowers.
</p>
            <p>Many letters in the correspondence series were subsequently used by Whitman to draft poems. The originals of these items are filed in the manuscripts series and photocopies inserted in appropriate folders in
the correspondence series.
</p>
            <p>The description of the photographs includes the "Saunders" number, when known. An extensive description of the method used by Henry S. Saunders for cataloging photographs of Whitman is printed in <title render="italic">The Walt Whitman Quarterly Review,</title> Fall/Winter 1986-1987, which can be found in Box 5, Folder 50 of this collection.

                  <p>A draft of
<title render="doublequote">After the Supper and Talk
</title> on one composite leaf comprising at least seven irregularly cut fragments of different types of white paper pasted to each other and, collectively, to one leaf (25 x 20 cm.) of blue-ruled white laid paper
with a partly visible watermark. In brown-black and black ink with extensive revisions in the same inks, in pencil, and in lighter brown ink. This poem was rejected by
<title render="italic">Harper's
</title> in 1885 but published in
<title render="italic">Lippincott's Magazine
</title> in November 1887, after which it eventually became the final poem in the "first annex" titled
<title render="doublequote">Sands at Seventy.
</title> To the verso are pasted sections 16 and 18-19 of
<title render="doublequote">Poem of Joys
</title> (final title:
<title render="doublequote">A Song of Joys
</title>) clipped either from the independent book
<title render="italic">Passage to India
</title> (1871) or from the
<title render="doublequote">Passage to India
</title> supplement to
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass.
</title> The section numbers of these lines are deleted in orange crayon, and the whole paste-on is deleted in pencil, with the pencil note, in a hand other than Whitman's, "Original mss/ Walt Whitman/ Poet"
appearing to the right of it.
</p>
                  <p>This is an earlier draft than manuscripts located in the Feinberg Collection at the Library of Congress. The order of inscription seems to have been as follows, as deduced from incision patterns, paper types,
and the overlap of letters on transferred sections of paper. First Whitman inscribed and heavily revised a draft of the poem on a section of gray-ruled wove paper. Wanting to avoid rewriting the clearest lines, he
excised these (comprising the first two verses and the words "Shunning the..." from the original third verse) and pasted them to a section of blue-ruled wove paper with letterhead reading, in part, "Attorney.../
Washington...," apparently discarding the section of gray-ruled paper upon which the rest of the original verses appeared. These excised verses he drafted again on the blue-ruled paper. He then used a paste-on
fragment of laid paper to revise the second half of the verse beginning "Shunning..."; at the end of the sentence, however, he deleted the period and added the words "so hard to unclasp his hand[s?]!" (That he
added this as an afterthought is indicated by the fact that the half-line is crowded in over a preexisting curve along the lower edge of the laid fragment). Unsatisfied with the addition, he deleted part of it,
tested and deleted the phrase "release those hands", deleted "so hard to," and then, out of space, squeezed a revision of this line in on the gray-ruled paper after the verse "Good-bye...repeating." It next
occurred to Whitman to add an explanatory line beginning "(No more will they meet...)" after "hands," but since he had no space in which to do so he cut apart the composite leaf and pasted the two halves to a
small section of wove paper&#8212;just large enough to hold the pieces together and afford room for the parenthesis. In revising the parenthesis, however, he ran out of space again. It was at this point that he
obtained the large section of blue-ruled laid paper upon which the other sections are all overlaid, and, cutting away the second half of the parenthetical verse, pasted both of what were now composite half-leaves
to the blue-ruled leaf. He then inscribed on this leaf the title, his revision of the rest of the parenthetical verse (in space he left between the composite halves), and the revised final verse. (It is difficult
to determine at what point Whitman excised the title and last verse from the composite leaves, beyond noting that he did so before pasting the leaves to the blue-ruled section).

                  <p>Including "The Return of the Heroes." On 29 pages, many of them composite leaves, comprising five different cuttings or packs of paper on which two or more leaves are inscribed, and other cuttings on which only
one leaf is inscribed. All but a handful of the leaves are inscribed on white laid paper ruled in light blue-green on both sides or on all of one side and some of the other. In his
<date normal="1954">1954
</date> edition and study of the manuscript in
<title render="italic">Modern Philology
</title> (vol. 52, no. 1), Fredson Bowers grouped the leaves by cutting-type as follows (letters having been added here for convenience). Type A: Leaves 1 and 21. Type B: Leaves 2-3. Type C: Leaves 4-5 and 15-16.
Type D: Leaves 6-9, 12-14, and 19. Type E: Leaves 17-18. As Bradley and Blodgett note, this poem was first published in the
<date normal="1867-09">September, 1867
</date> issue of
<title render="italic">The Galaxy
</title> and reprinted in the London-based
<title render="italic">Tinsley's Magazine
</title> in October of that year. After appearing with various revisions in the

                     <title render="italic">Passage to India
</title> and the

</date>
                     <title render="doublequote">Passage to India
</title> supplement to
<title render="italic">Two Rivulets
</title>, the poem was permanently retitled
<title render="doublequote">The Return of the Heroes.
</title> This took place in the
<date normal="1881">1881
</date> edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>, where the poem appeared without its original first two verse paragraphs. At one point this manuscript was in the possession of Whitman scholar Clara Barrus, who clipped to Whitman's title page a note
including these lines: "...Precious souvenirs, given me by Thos. B. Harned, one of Whitman's literary executors. You can almost feel Walt's heart beat in these lines." This and other short notes by Barrus have
been unclipped from the leaves. Annotations by Barrus (or another collector with a similar hand) are mentioned when significant enough to warrant attention, but are otherwise left undescribed.

revisions in the same ink and in pencil. Whitman's boxed pencil note "Harvest carol for 1867" runs up the left margin, followed by the unboxed note "1867&#8212;the great/ Harvest." (The second line at the top of
the leaf, deleted, reads "The great Harvest of 1867"). After further revision these sections became, respectively, verse paragraphs 1 and 2 (together comprising section 1) of the 1871 version of the poem. In 1881,
this entire section, as noted above, was deleted from the poem.

follows: 11 x 12.5 cm. (upper); 9.5 x 12.5 cm. (lower); 8 x 12 cm. (backing). Inscribed in black ink, with revisions in the the same ink and in pencil. Barrus jotted down the 1881 title and page number at the top
of the leaf, along with the note "I&#8212;." With further revision&#8212;including the deletion of the last line, beginning "O theatre of Time,..."&#8212;these sections became verse paragraphs 3 and 4 (comprising
section 2) of the 1871 version of the poem. In 1881 these paragraphs went unnumbered and, with the deletion of the original first section, together formed section 1 of the poem (hence the "I" added by Barrus).

Leaves 7-9 contain the verses that would eventually complete this section, and, as Bowers notes, leaves 6-9 come from the same pack of paper, are all inscribed and revised in the same media, and feature matching

when the bottom section is folded up. All three sections are inscribed in black ink, with extensive revisions in the same ink and in pencil. Barrus or another annotator has added the number "&#8212;4&#8212;" in
pencil at the head of the leaf. With some small revisions these lines became section 5 (verse paragraphs 7-10) of the 1871 version of the poem, and in 1881 they constituted the first three verse paragraphs of
section 4.

<title render="doublequote">A Carol of Harvest, for 1867

Following this leaf is a blank section of white wove paper (20 x 14.5 cm.), ruled in blue on both sides with a red and blue vertical rule, and featuring a thin section of hand-annotated printed matter affixed to

                  <p>On one leaf (19.5 x 15.5 cm.) of blue laid paper, in medium brown-black ink, with minor revisions in the same and a check mark(?) in pink ink. These notes for a cluster of poems, "(in the/ same way as Calamus
Leaves")/ expressing the idea and/ sentiment of/ Happiness,/ Extatic life, (or moods,)..." appear on the verso of a page of half-prose, half-poetic notes, inscribed, revised, and deleted in pencil, for a poem or
essay to be titled
<title render="doublequote">Living Pictures
</title> or
<title render="doublequote">America.
</title> As Edward F. Grier observes in his notes to Whitman's
<title render="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts
</title> (the fourth volume in
<title render="italic">The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman
</title>; New York: New York University Press, 1984), the similarity of
<title render="doublequote">Living Pictures
</title> to
<title render="doublequote">A Song for Occupations
</title>&#8212;first published, untitled, in the original 1855 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>&#8212;combined with Whitman's use of the old long "s" in the word "less," indicates that the leaf was inscribed quite early in Whitman's poetic career. Whitman's use of the title
<title render="doublequote">Calamus Leaves
</title> on the other side of the leaf, as in some very similar notes currently housed at Duke University that point towards the 1860 cluster
<title render="doublequote">Enfans d'Adam,
</title> dates the notes for this "cluster," as Grier observes (referring to Fredson Bowers's system of dating), to some point in the late spring of 1859. The line beginning "Strong, well-fibred, bearded,/
athletic[,] full of love..." calls to mind the verse "If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred,/ And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted,/ And in man or woman a clean, strong,
firm-fibred body, is more beautiful/ than the most beautiful face" from the untitled 1855 poem that would become
<title render="doublequote">I Sing the Body Electric
</title> in 1867.

</title>, where it appeared in the cluster

then adding two paste-ons (roughly 5.5 and 4 x 21.5 cm.) to this extra section. Inscribed and revised in dark brown-black ink, with Whitman's signature and the note "You can put the name W[alt] W[hitman?] either
at the top or/ bottom as you prefer" at the foot of the leaf. On the verso appear the notes "Death's Valley" (twice) and "Magazine/ April, 1892" in Whitman executor Horace Traubel's[?] hand. Whitman's
correspondence indicates that the poem was written and sold to
<title render="italic">Harper's New Monthly Magazine
</title> in 1889, although it did not appear there until April 1892, after the poet's death. Bradley and Blodgett note that Whitman originally included the poem in his 1891 manuscript for the "second annex"
<title render="doublequote">Good-Bye My Fancy,
</title> and Traubel grouped it in the cluster
<title render="doublequote">Old Age Echoes,
</title> which he added to
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title> in 1897. The "picture" of the subtitle is
<title render="doublequote">The Valley of the Shadow of Death
</title> by American painter George Inness, an engraving of which appeared in
<title render="italic">Harper's
</title> facing the poem. An engraving of a painting of Whitman by J.W. Alexander appeared in the same issue. Included in this folder along with Whitman's verses are a copy of the Inness engraving on a piece of
cardboard, along with the Alexander reproduction and the table of contents page, both removed from the April 1892 issue of
<title render="italic">Harper's.

                  <p>On one leaf of white wove paper (19.5 x 12.5 cm.), irregularly cut along the left margin. Inscribed in dark brown ink, with extensive revisions in the same ink, in a fine pen, and in pencil, apparently in that
order. The subtitle has a horizontal pencil line through it, but a zig-zag pencil line through it seems to have been erased, along with the phrase "(at the entrance)" below it. The title
<title render="doublequote">Inscription
</title> and the words "One's-self" and "For You" are inscribed in an ornamental style. This appears to be a revision of other
<title render="doublequote">Inscriptions
</title> Whitman gathered in a notebook, along with prose drafts for a never-finished introduction to
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass
</title>, and attached to his copy of the 1855 paper-bound edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>. (The entire collection of draft "inscription" and introductory material is currently housed at the New York Public Library.) In the 1867
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title> Whitman culled material from this poem and the other
<title render="doublequote">Inscription
</title> poems to create an italicized
<title render="doublequote">Inscription
</title> that he placed before
<title render="doublequote">Starting from Paumanok
</title> at the beginning of the book; in that edition he also transferred part of verse 2 to
<title render="doublequote">As I Sat Alone by Blue Ontario's Shore
</title> (later the line was dropped and the title was revised to
<title render="doublequote">By Blue Ontario's Shore
</title>). From 1872 onward, this poem, revised and retitled
<title render="doublequote">One's-Self I Sing,
</title> was printed as the first of several poems in the
<title render="doublequote">Inscriptions
</title> cluster that opened the book. In the 1888
<title render="italic">November Boughs
</title>, however, Whitman reprinted the 1867 version as
<title render="doublequote">Small the Theme of my Chant.
</title> Note: This draft may have been written before the Civil War, since it does not include the 1867 line "My Days I sing, and the Lands&#8212;with interstice I knew/ of hapless War."

                     <p>On a small section of light yellow wove paper (7 x 15 cm.) with all four corners cropped for mounting. Four pinholes appear in the center. Inscribed and revised on the recto in pencil; the first line on the
verso (beginning "I have all lives, all effects, all/ causes,...") is inscribed and revised in the same brown ink as Leaf 2, and the two lines that follow it (beginning "This is the earth's word&#8212;the round/
and compact earth's,") are inscribed, revised, and deleted (with a single vertical stroke) in pencil. Bucke prints both sets of lines on p. 32 of
<title render="italic">Notes and Fragments
</title>. Whitman apparently never used the recto lines, but the deleted lines on the verso bear a strong resemblance to the opening of his 1856
<title render="doublequote">Poem of The Sayers of The Words of The Earth,
</title> titled in successive editions (as Bradley and Blodgett note)
<title render="doublequote">To the Sayers of Words

</title>),
<title render="doublequote">A Song of the Rolling Earth.
</title> The undeleted ink line on the verso is a later(?) draft of a line inscribed in Feinberg notebook #697 at the Library of Congress, transcribed by Blodgett in

covered by the other page. Inscribed in the same brown ink as the undeleted line on the verso of Leaf 1; revised in that ink and in pencil. Whitman apparently never used this poem or fragment, but Bucke prints it

                     <p>On a very small section of uncropped white wove paper (4.5 x 12 cm.). No pinholes. Inscribed (hurriedly) in black ink using a thin nib. A bright pinkish-red ink check mark(?) appears in the upper right corner
of the note. A faint horizontal line beneath part of "A City Walk," along with the words' capitalization and central position on the page, indicate that Whitman may have contemplated using the words as the title
of an independent poem. The closest he came to this title was
<title render="doublequote">City of Walks and Joys,
</title> the name he originally assigned to
<title render="doublequote">Calamus
</title> 18 in his
<title render="doublequote">Blue Book
</title> revisions of the 1860 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>. This title was changed in the
<title render="doublequote">Blue Book
</title> to
<title render="doublequote">City of orgies, walks and joys
</title> and finally became
<title render="doublequote">City of Orgies
</title> in the 1867 edition. These notes, written in the form of a single poetic verse, could represent an intermediate stage between the notes on Leaf 3 and those on Leaf 5. Bucke prints the lines in prose form
on p. 120 of
<title render="italic">Notes and Fragments
</title>. Bucke's transcription is republished, accompanied by the note "Manuscript not found," on p. 1292 of the

before being pasted to the lower section. Inscribed in dark brown-black ink with no revisions. The trial verses on the lower section (beginning "Poem&#8212;As of walking along a street") are fragmentary and
hurriedly inscribed, but the upper section is written in ornamental script, and both parts of the title are underlined. A wavy line appears at the foot of that section. The word "Original" at the head of the upper
section suggests that Whitman was sketching out a new poem for a revised edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass
</title>. If it was the 1860 edition, as his style of inscription here appears to indicate, it is possible that this leaf, like Leaves 3 and 4, could represent an early stage of the poem that would eventually

lines on the verso are deleted with a single vertical pencil stroke. They originally occupied the lower half of a full leaf of verse; after deleting these (current) verso lines and discarding the upper half of the
leaf Whitman turned the page ninety degrees and flipped it over to use for the current recto notes. The recto notes represent an early stage of lines partially incorporated in
<title render="doublequote">Poem of Salutation,
</title> the new third poem in the 1856 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass
</title>, which was permanently retitled
<title render="doublequote">Salut au Monde!
</title> in the 1860 edition. If the note or title "Europe" suggests that Whitman might have first intended to divide his salutations into discrete sections based on the different continents, this is a plan he did
not follow in the published version(s). The more polished (but deleted) lines on the verso represent a recasting in poetic form of several lines from the 1855 Preface to
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>. These were further revised for the 1856
<title render="doublequote">Poem of Many in One,
</title> after which the first verse drafted on this page (cut off here, and beginning "over the Texan, Mexican, Florid[ian,]/ Cuban seas...") was dropped. The two verses below this, however, were preserved
relatively unchanged through the poem's many transformations until the text was essentially fixed under the title
<title render="doublequote">By Blue Ontario's Shore
</title> in 1881. Bucke prints the top section of notes (incorrectly) on p. 157, and the lower section of verses (beginning "And the tough Scotch sailor crosses the Minch...") on p. 10 of

vertical pencil stroke. Those on the recto are separated by a horizontal line. The verso lines (beginning with the individually deleted line "O Walt Whitman, show us some/ pictures!" and continuing "America,
always Pictorial!") represent a later draft of the beginning of the poem
<title render="doublequote">Pictures
</title> than the most complete extant version, which is contained in the pre-1855
<title render="doublequote">Pictures
</title> notebook currently housed at Yale University. Bucke dates the lines to around 1880, when Whitman was working on a short version of
<title render="doublequote">Pictures
</title> both for magazine publication and for the 1881 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>, where it was published as
<title render="doublequote">My Picture-Gallery.
</title> (See the entry for
<title render="doublequote">My picture gallery
</title> below.) But Whitman's early style of inscription in this draft, along with the line "It is round&#8212;it has room for America, north and south" and his use of his own name in the deleted first line, all
suggest that Whitman may have inscribed this draft around the same time that he was working on the new 1856
<title render="doublequote">Poem of Salutations
</title> (eventually
<title render="doublequote">Salut au Monde!
</title>). This draft also suggests that at one point he may have considered linking what would become
<title render="doublequote">Poem of Salutations
</title> and the formally and thematically similar
<title render="doublequote">Pictures
</title> more directly. Bucke prints the verso and recto lines, with several deleted words restored, on p. 27 of

                  <p>These descriptions follow the present arbitrary but longstanding physical arrangement of the manuscripts, first collected in a series of folders, and now in two boxed binders. This arrangement groups
manuscripts according to their position in and out of the "clusters" comprising the 1860 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass
</title>, although the 1860 order of the clusters themselves has not been followed by the collector who arranged the poems.
<title render="doublequote">Sparkles from the Wheel
</title> and
<title render="doublequote">Fables
</title> (both 1871; see [Vol. 2, p. 163] and [Vol. 2, p. 164]) are included in the list by virtue of being housed with earlier poems in the second binder.
</p>
                  <p>All of these poems except for
<title render="doublequote">Sparkles from the Wheel
</title> and
<title render="doublequote">Fables
</title> were published in the 1860 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass.
</title> The manuscripts are generally followed by print versions of the poems disbound by a collector from the 1860 edition. Since Whitman apparently had no contact with the printed pages they have not been
described here. Neither have the annotations made by collectors on many of Whitman's leaves. The measurements given below are taken at the points of greatest height and width, in that order, for each page.
Following Fredson Bowers's practice in describing the manuscripts, the location of major pinhole clusters in each page, where present, has also been noted. (The pinholes, as Bowers argues, can yield helpful clues
as to Whitman's practices of revision. Intact pages have multiple pinholes in the middle; thus, pinholes at the top of a small page indicate that the fragment was removed from the lower section of a full leaf, and
vice versa). The types of paper and writing implements used by Whitman in each case have been documented for the same reasons. Since, in many cases, after 1860 Whitman changed the poems' titles and revised and
transferred them elsewhere, a brief narrative of each poem's post-1860 evolution accompanies its description.

</p>
                  <p>The entry after the page numbers is the first autograph line at the top of the page. Beginning at page 34 of volume 1, the corresponding published poems are removed from 1860 edition and interleaved with the

order. Each leaf is numbered consecutively by Whitman, in pencil, in the lower left corner. Each leaf is also stabbed in the left margin and punctured with numerous pinholes. Bowers has identified at least four
stages of revision based on the writing implements and ink used by Whitman to make his corrections: first pencil, then dark ink with a fine pen, once again pencil, and finally thin light-brown ink.

</title> In drafting the revised version of this first section on a Williamsburgh tax form (see Vol. 1, p. 1) Whitman excised and apparently destroyed the verses at the top of this leaf, striking through the
verses (beginning "[Boy of the] Mannahatta&#8212;boy of/ the prairies,...") below the cut. He then left a revised section of verses on the lower part of the leaf (beginning "Victory, union, faith, democracy,/
prudence,...") undeleted. These lines correspond to section 2 of

<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass.
</title> In 1867 the poems received individual titles, and in that and subsequent editions a small number of poems were removed from and added to the cluster; but, with the exceptions noted below, the great
majority of the original poems remained in
<title render="doublequote">Calamus
</title> through all the versions of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>. Twelve of the manuscript poems are taken from a small notebook and marked with ornamental Roman numerals, which Bowers used to reconstruct the original sequence upon which

<title render="doublequote">Live Oak, with Moss.

                        <p>This leaf comprises two sections of a poem inscribed (with very few alterations) on the first and third sides of a folded half-sheet (21.5 x 16 cm.) of the same white wove paper used for "Long I was held by the
life." Whitman also used the same light-brown ink for these passages as for [Long I was held by the life/ that exhibits itself,], and, as Bowers notes, the pinholes in the two leaves match up. On the first side of
the folded leaf a blue pencil was used to correct a pencil number 7 to a 1, and on the third side the blue pencil corrected a pencil 8 to a 2. The five verses beginning "Was it I who walked the/ earth..." were not
used in
<title render="doublequote">Calamus,
</title> but the five lines beginning "Scented herbage of my breast" became the opening verses of section 2 of the cluster in the 1860
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>. In the 1867 and later editions the first line was used as the title of the poem. See the following five entries for drafts of the remaining verses in the section, written on larger leaves (roughly 20 x
16 cm.) of the same paper, in darker ink, and all heavily revised.

and, like them, with only minor revisions. The pages were folded and pinned together to form a small pamphlet. Pinholes mostly at center-top and in what was the left margin of the pamphlet. The lines on page 1
became verses 1-8 of section 4 of

</title> in 1860; page 2 ("Solitary, smelling the earthy/ smell,...") became verses 9-14; page 3 ("Here lilac with a branch of/ pine,") became verses 15-22; and page 4 ("And stems of currants, and/ plum-blows,")
became verses 23-28. From 1867 on the poem was titled

further appearances of this poem during the poet's lifetime, Whitman having canceled it in his

this number was deleted and the current ?101 added in fine pen. Bowers explains that the poem, in two discrete verse sections and inscribed in black ink (with title), originally occupied one full side of this
leaf. When Whitman wanted to expand the first section without having to retranscribe the second one, he simply cut the two sections apart, flipped the first section over (turning it upside-down in the process),
pasted the second section to the lower edge of the verso of the first section, and wrote his new first section (beginning "Throwing far, throwing over the head/ of death" and incorporating the original title as
verse 3) in the blank space now created above the second section. The new first section is written and revised in light ink. As Bradley and Blodgett observe, the words "thirty-eight years old the/ eighty-first
year of The States" indicate that Whitman composed the poem in 1857; these were revised to read "I, forty years old the Eighty-third Year of The States" in the 1860

center, and also some at the top, of each leaf. This poem was originally numbered 89. Whitman also numbered each leaf in the lower-left corner in pencil: the leaves follow the order 1-9, 9 1/2 (a full page despite
its number), and 10-15. The expression "the Eightieth year of/ These States" at the top of leaf 2 indicates, as Bradley and Blodgett note, that Whitman was working on this poem as early as 1856. It became section
4 of
<title render="doublequote">Chants Democratic

<title render="doublequote">American Feuillage,
</title> a name it kept until being permanently retitled

few pinholes in the left margin. The deleted title is
<title render="doublequote">Poemet&#8212;.
</title> As Bowers notes,
<title render="doublequote">Evolutions.&#8212;
</title> is written in the light ink, and the number "41&#8212;" in a darker ink than the text. Whitman numbered each leaf in pencil in the upper right corner. As Bradley and Blodgett note, this poem was first
published in the January 14, 1860 issue of the
<title render="italic">New York Saturday Press
</title> under the title
<title render="doublequote">You and Me and To-day,
</title> after which it became section 7 of
<title render="doublequote">Chants Democratic
</title> in the 1860
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>. In 1867 Whitman ungrouped it and permanently retitled it
<title render="doublequote">With Antecedents
</title>; in 1881 it was permanently transferred to the new cluster
<title render="doublequote">Birds of Passage.
</title> The manuscript leaves correspond to the published verses in the 1860
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title> as follows: leaf 1 to verses 1-7; leaf 2 ("With the sale of slaves&#8212;") to verses 8-13; leaf 3 ("With this year, sending itself/ ahead...") to verses 15-22; leaf 4 ("I have the idea of all, and/ am
all,...") to verses 24-30; leaf 5 ("I promulge that all past/ days...") to verses 31-38; and leaf 6 ("And that there is no untruth/ in time...") to verses 40-41.

finally, in light ink. Whitman also numbered each leaf, in pencil, in the upper right corner. Each leaf has a pinhole cluster in the center and a few holes in the left margin. The first leaf consists of an
expanded opening section (title and three verses) in light ink inscribed on a small section of pink paper (9.5 x 12.5 cm.) pasted to what Whitman left (18 x 12 cm.) of the original leaf after apparently excising
the original opening verse(s). The lower left corner of this first leaf, with part of two or three words, has been worn away. In the 1860 edition of

<title render="doublequote">Chants Democratic.
</title> In 1867, Bradley and Blodgett note, he gave it the permanent title
<title render="doublequote">Song at Sunset

<title render="doublequote">Songs of Parting

                     <p>On two leaves of pink paper, in black ink, with heavy revisions in the same ink, in pencil, in fine pen (very black ink), and in light ink. With the fine pen Whitman inscribed and circled the note "2d/ piece/
in Book" in the upper-right corner of the first leaf. The first leaf is a standard page measuring 21.5 x 13 cm., while the second is a composite of two sections pasted together, the top section measuring 6 x 13
and the bottom one 18.5 x 12.5 cm. The small top section is inscribed in light ink on the verso of some deleted draft verses excised from
<title render="doublequote">So Long!
</title> (see Vol. 2, pp. 153-159); Bowers observes that Whitman seems to have cut away the original first verse(s) in order to attach this expanded verse (in light ink) to the main body of original verses.
<title render="doublequote">Thought
</title> became section 9 of
<title render="doublequote">Chants Democratic
</title> in 1860. In the 1867
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title> Whitman combined it with the second
<title render="doublequote">Thought
</title> (Vol. 2, pp. 21 - 22) to form the poem
<title render="doublequote">Thoughts
</title> in the supplement
<title render="doublequote">Songs Before Parting.
</title> (This particular
<title render="doublequote">Thought
</title> was numbered section 1 of the composite poem.) In 1871
<title render="doublequote">Thoughts
</title> appeared in the cluster
<title render="doublequote">Songs of Parting
</title> within the main body of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>, and in 1881, Bradley and Blodgett note, it achieved its final position within that cluster. The leaves correspond to the verses in the 1860
<title render="doublequote">Chants Democratic
</title> version as follows: leaf 1 to verses 1-6, and leaf 2 ("How the great cities appear&#8212;") to verses 7-14.

with extensive revisions in the same ink, in fine pen, and in light ink. The paste-on revision is in light ink, and contains an expanded version of the original lines Whitman cut away and apparently discarded. The
verso of the paste-on section contains, as Bowers notes, five undeleted draft lines that would become the final verses of
<title render="doublequote">Proto-Leaf
</title> in the 1860
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>; Whitman's small note in the lower-right corner, in a semi-circle, reads "end of Poem" (see Vol. 1, p. 33 for a later version of these lines). This
<title render="doublequote">Thought
</title> became section 11 of
<title render="doublequote">Chants Democratic
</title> in 1860; in 1867 Whitman made it section 2 of the composite poem
<title render="doublequote">Thoughts
</title>, and the two
<title render="doublequote">Thought
</title> poems were indivisible from that point on (see 2:1:3 for details). Leaf 1 corresponds to verses 9-15 in the
<title render="doublequote">Chants Democratic
</title> version and leaf 2 ("Of the new and good names&#8212;") to verses 16-22.

in pencil. On the verso of both pieces appear fragments of extensive pencil notes for a speech or essay Whitman wrote (most likely) in 1856, and revised in 1858, under the working title
<title render="doublequote">Slavery&#8212;the Slaveholders&#8212;/ &#8212;The Constitution&#8212;the/ true America and Ameri-/cans, the laboring persons&#8212;.
</title> The lines seem to represent fragments of an earlier, discarded draft of a manuscript currently housed at Duke University. See p. 2185 in vol. 6,
<title render="italic">Notes and Index
</title>, of Edward F. Grier's edition of Whitman's
<title render="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts
</title> in
<title render="italic">The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman
</title> (New York: New York University Press, 1984). See the verso of
<title render="doublequote">To a Cantatrice.&#8212;
</title> (Vol. 2, p. 92), inscribed on the same paper, for an additional fragment of the draft. After undergoing extensive revisions, in 1860
<title render="doublequote">To a Historian
</title> became section 10 of
<title render="doublequote">Chants Democratic.
</title> In 1867 Whitman deleted five verses, transferred the poem to the supplement
<title render="doublequote">Songs Before Parting,
</title> and permanently retitled it
<title render="doublequote">To a Historian.
</title> It appeared as the fifth poem in the opening cluster
<title render="doublequote">Inscriptions

<title render="italic">Leaves

                     <p>On five leaves of pink paper (all roughly 22 x 13.5 cm.), in black ink, with extensive alterations in the same ink, in pencil, and in light ink. Pinhole cluster in center of each leaf. As Bowers notes, the poem
was originally numbered 67, and the partly erased pencil note "Needs to be/ re-written/ or excluded" appears in the upper-right corner of the first leaf. Whitman also numbered the leaves in pencil in their lower-
left corners. The leaves correspond to verses in section 12 of
<title render="doublequote">Chants Democratic
</title> in the 1860
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title> as follows: leaf 1 to verses 1-7; leaf 2 ("Come duly to the divine/ power to use words?") to verses 8-13; leaf 3 ("Then toward that man or/ that woman...") to verses 14-16; leaf 4 ("O Now I see arise
orators/ fit for America,") to verses 17-19; leaf 5 ("Of a great vocalism, when/ you hear it,...") to verses 20-26. After excising and altering numerous verses of the poem and numbering different verse paragraphs
for the
<title render="doublequote">Chants Democratic
</title> version, Whitman next made the poem the second numbered section of the last
<title render="doublequote">Leaves of Grass
</title> cluster in the 1867 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>. From 1872 to 1876 it bore the title
<title render="doublequote">To Oratists.
</title> Then, in 1881, Whitman deleted several lines, joining this poem with a previously unconnected poem known as
<title render="doublequote">Voices
</title> to form
<title render="doublequote">Vocalism
</title> in the cluster
<title render="doublequote">Autumn Rivulets,
</title> a position and identity the now-composite poem retained from that point on.

the title). A partial horizontal line at the top of the first leaf indicates that Whitman cut away the original title and number; Bowers notes that in a list of his poems Whitman refers to this poem as
<title render="doublequote">38. Walt Whitman's Laws.
</title> Pinholes clustered mostly in center of each leaf, with some in the left margins and at least one pair in the upper right corner. Whitman numbered each leaf in pencil in the lower left corner. These pages
were transformed into section 13 of
<title render="doublequote">Chants Democratic

<title render="italic">Leaves
</title> as follows: Leaf 1 to verses 1-6; Leaf 2 ("Statements, models, censuses,") to verses 7-12; Leaf 3 ("What do you suppose Creation/ is?") to verses 13-18. A pencil paragraph mark appears in the upper left
corner of the third leaf; the verses on it formed the third numbered sub-section of the poem in 1860. In 1867 it was greatly shortened and transferred to the final
<title render="doublequote">Leaves of Grass
</title> cluster in
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>. In 1872 the poem was permanently retitled
<title render="doublequote">Laws for Creations
</title> Its final position was in the cluster

Whitman penciled in a question mark, in parentheses, in the upper-right corner. This became section 17 of
<title render="doublequote">Chants Democratic
</title> in the 1860
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>, with leaf 1 corresponding to verses 1-6 and leaf 2 ("We confer on equal terms with/ each of The States,") to verses 7-13. Although he dropped it from
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title> in 1867, Whitman nonetheless used the poem, permanently retitled
<title render="doublequote">On Journeys through the States,
</title> in
<title render="italic">Passage to India
</title> in 1871. In 1872 and 1876 it appeared in the
<title render="doublequote">Passage to India

<title render="italic">Leaves

over the top section of the first leaf, gluing it to the rest of the leaf, in order to transform the original first line into the title. (The current verso of the top section still bears, undeleted, the first line
"Night on the prairies[,]" along with the title
<title render="doublequote">Leaf.&#8212;
</title> and the number 73, originally 72). Pinholes in center and in upper-left margin of each leaf. Whitman deleted the pencil numbers 16, 17, and 18 in the lower-left corner of the leaves, substituting the
numbers 1 through 3. This poem became section 15 of the cluster
<title render="doublequote">Leaves of Grass
</title> in 1860, with the leaves corresponding to the published lines as follows: leaf 1 to numbered verse paragraphs 1-3 and half of 4; leaf 2 ("I was thinking this globe/ enough for me...") to the second half
of 4, and 5; leaf 3 ("O I see now that life/ cannot exhibit all...") to verse paragraph 6. In 1867 Whitman restored the title
<title render="doublequote">Night on the Prairies

pencil. The second leaf is a composite formed when Whitman deleted and cut away the original first two verses on the leaf, flipped the new small section (7 x 13 cm.) over and upside-down, pasted it to the foot of
the remaining original verses (14.5 x 13 cm.), and inscribed a verse in light ink on the newly created blank space. Pinholes at top, in left margin, and in original and (in the case of the second leaf) current
center of each leaf. This poem became section 18 of the cluster
<title render="doublequote">Leaves of Grass
</title> in the 1860
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>, with leaf 1 corresponding to part of numbered verse paragraph 1, leaf 2 ("Discovering to-day there is/ no lie,...") to the rest of paragraph 1 and to 2, leaf 3 ("Where has failed a perfect/ return
indifferent of lies or the truth?") to paragraph 3 and part of 4, and leaf 4 ("And that the truth includes/ all,...") to the rest of paragraph 4. In 1872 the poem received the title
<title render="doublequote">All is Truth,

revising ink, and the lower two sections are in the same black ink. The bottom section contains revisions in fine pen (very black ink). As Bowers notes, pinholes towards the foot of the bottom section indicate
that it was originally the top of a full leaf; the only other pinholes appear near the top of the middle section. This poem became section 19 of the cluster

                        <p>On eighteen leaves of pink paper and two of white wove paper, numbered in pencil by a collector (in the upper-right corners), and described individually as follows. (See Bowers 196-215 for more details.) Leaf 1
(21.5 x 13 cm.): pink paper, in black ink, with revisions in the same ink, a blacker ink (the number 36), and the light revising ink. Multiple pinholes in center and left margin. Corresponds to verse paragraphs 1-
4 in the 1860 published version. Leaves 2-3 (21.5 x 13 cm.): pink paper, in black ink, with revisions in pencil, in blacker ink, and in the light ink. Multiple pinholes in center and left margin. Whitman penciled
in the numbers 56a and 56b at the top of the leaves, and also (possibly) a number 5 in the upper-left corner of leaf 2. These leaves correspond to verse paragraphs 5-8 and 9-12. Leaf 4 (21 x 13 cm.): pink paper
(21.5 x 13 cm.), in black ink, with revisions in the same ink and light ink. Originally titled
<title render="doublequote">Contact
</title> and inscribed, as Bowers notes, as if it were the beginning of a major independent poem. The final verse was deleted with pencil strokes, but these strokes were erased. Multiple pinholes in center and at
top. Corresponds to verse paragraphs 13-14 in the published version. Leaves 5-8 (all roughly 21 x 13 cm.): pink paper, in black ink, with revisions in pencil, in blacker ink, in fine pen (very black ink), and in
light ink. Multiple pinholes in center and at top. Leaves 5-7 bear the deleted pencil numbers 2-4 in the lower left corner; leaf 8 bears the undeleted number 5, as well as the pencil number 2 at the top. Leaf 7
has an undeleted pencil 1 in the same position, as well as Whitman's pencil note "Fifth Month" above the word "May" in the first line. These leaves correspond to verse paragraphs 14 through 16 (verses 1-3); 16
(verse 4) through 18 (verse 1); 18 (2-5) through 19 (1-2); and 19 (3-6) through 20. Leaves 9-10: pink paper (the first 21 x 13 cm., the second cut down to 14.5 x 13 cm.), in black ink, with revisions in fine pen
(very black ink), in pencil, and in light ink. The section excised from leaf 10 was pasted, as Bowers notes, to the foot of what is now leaf 12. Multiple pinholes in the (original) center and at the top of both
leaves. These leaves bear the deleted pencil numbers 6 and 6 1/2 (lower left corner) and the undeleted numbers 3 and 4 (at top). They correspond to verse paragraphs 21 through 23 (verses 1-3) and 23 (verses 4-8).
Leaves 11-12: white wove paper (both 20 x 15.5 cm., with a 7.5 x 13 cm. pink-paper section from leaf 10 pasted to leaf 12), in dark ink (thick pen), with revisions in the same ink, in pencil, and in light ink.
Multiple pinholes in center and at top. These leaves bear the deleted pencil numbers 15 and 16 (lower left corner) and the undeleted numbers 5-6 (at top). The lines inscribed on the white pages correspond to
verses 1-10 and 11-13 of verse paragraph 24; the three pink-paper verses correspond to paragraph 25. Leaves 13-14: pink paper (21 x 13 cm.), in black ink, with revisions in the same ink and fine pen. Multiple
pinholes in center and at top. These leaves bear the deleted pencil numbers 7-8 (lower left corner), and leaf 13 still carries the number 7 at the top. They correspond to verse paragraphs 26-27 (verse 1) and 27
(verses 2-6). Leaves 15-20: pink paper (all roughly 21 x 13 cm.), in black ink, with revisions in the same ink, in pencil, in fine pen (very black ink), and in light ink. Multiple pinholes in center and at top.
These leaves bear the deleted pencil numbers 14 and 9-13 (lower-left corner), although the number 11 on leaf 18 is undeleted. They correspond to verse paragraphs 28-29, 30-31, 32-34 (with a pencil X to the right
of the last lines on this leaf [leaf 17]), 35-36, 37-39, and 40-41.
<title render="doublequote">Poem of Joys,
</title> which was never grouped in a
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title> cluster, became
<title render="doublequote">Poems of Joy
</title> in 1867, but reverted to the original title in its next two iterations (in the
<title render="doublequote">Passage to India
</title> supplement of 1872 and 1876). In 1881 it was finally titled
<title render="doublequote">A Song of Joys
</title> and left independent of any cluster.

few in left margin, of each leaf. Originally numbered 86; Whitman also numbered the leaves 1-5 (in pencil, lower left corner), with the 1 replacing a 6 and the 2 written over what looks like a 7. The leaves
correspond to the 1860 published version

(verses 2-5) through 5 (verses 1-3); leaf 4 ("And from to-day, sad and/ cogent,...") to verses 4-8 of section 5; and leaf 5 ("O I think now/ The east wind...") to the remaining four verses of section 5. Although
Whitman never changed the title, and did not revise the poem much, he did transfer it twice, grouping it in the cluster
<title render="doublequote">Songs of Insurrection
</title> within the main body of

pair at top, of each leaf. These poems were revised to form numbered sections of the ungrouped poem
<title render="doublequote">Says
</title> in the 1860 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>. According to Bradley and Blodgett, Whitman cut four verse paragraphs in the 1867
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title> version; from that point on the shortened poem appeared, ungrouped, under the title
<title render="doublequote">Suggestions
</title> until its final appearance in 1876. Leaf 1: originally numbered 85. Verses 3 and 4 went unpublished, but 1-2 and 5 became sections 1, 2, and 3 (verse 1) of the 1860 version. Leaf 2, [I say the least
developed/ person on earth...]: these lines became sections 3 (verse 2) and 4, with the second line remaining unpublished. Leaf 3,
<title render="doublequote">87&#8212;/ Say.
</title> [I say the human shape/ or face is so great,...]: first numbered 86. This became section 5. On the verso appears the deleted line "And though I lie dead." Leaf 4,
<title render="doublequote">88&#8212;/ Say.&#8212;
</title> [I say the word of a land/ fearing nothing&#8212;...]: first numbered 86, then 87. This leaf became section 6. Leaf 5,
<title render="doublequote">89&#8212;/ Say
</title> [I have said many times/ that materials...]: this leaf was originally numbered 88 and titled
<title render="doublequote">Thought,
</title> with two verses that Whitman deleted along with the first title. Below a horizontal pencil line he inscribed, at some point, verses that became section 7 of
<title render="doublequote">Says
</title> in 1860.

poem
<title render="doublequote">To My Soul
</title> in the 1860 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>. The first inscribed page corresponds to numbered sections 1 through 3, verses 1-3, of the 1860 version, and the second ("The unspeakable love I inter-/changed with women,") to section 3, verses 4-13. In
1867 Whitman cut eight lines and revised others, retitling the poem
<title render="doublequote">As Nearing Departure
</title> and moving it to an untitled group of poems in the supplement
<title render="doublequote">Songs Before Parting.

upper right corner, with the exception of leaves 6 and 7, which are numbered at top center. In tiny script and various inks, with very heavy revisions, as follows. Leaf 1: plain leaf (15 x 9 cm.) in medium-black
ink, with revisions in the same ink, in pencil, in fine pen (very black ink), and in light ink. Corresponds exactly in terms of the number of lines used to the first page of the poem as published (under the title
<title render="doublequote">So long!
</title>) in the 1860
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>. This first page comprised numbered sections 1 through 3, verses 1-6. Leaf 2 ("When fathers, firm, unconstrained, nonchal-/ant, open-eyed&#8212;..."): plain leaf (15 x 9 cm.), in medium-black ink, with
revisions in the same ink, in pencil, and in the fine pen (very black ink). Corresponds to sections 3 (verses 7-8) through 7 (verse 1) in the 1860 version. Leaf 3 ("Once more I proclaim the whole of/ America..."):
plain leaf (15 x 9 cm.), in medium-black ink, with revisions in the same ink and in pencil. Corresponds to sections 7 (verse 2) through 10, along with section 12, in the 1860 version. On the verso appear two
deleted sections, comprising nine verses (beginning "Yet, old throat, one loud/ cadenza!") revised from the bottom of original leaf 4, which Whitman compressed and reversed on the leaf 4 paste-on to eventually
form sections 15 and 16 in the published version. Leaf 4 ("I announce the continued union of/ The States,"): composite leaf measuring 15 x 9 cm., with a faded blue paste-on of 5.5 x 9 cm. covering several water-
damaged and heavily revised verses on the original leaf. In medium-black ink, with revisions in the same ink, in a slightly browner ink (thicker pen), in pencil, in fine pen, and in light ink. Corresponds to
sections 11 and 13-16 of the 1860 version. Leaf 5 ("Screaming electric, the atmosphere using,"): plain leaf (15 x 9 cm.), in medium-black ink, with revisions in the same ink, in pencil, and in light ink.
Corresponds to section 17 in the 1860 version. Whitman cut up a deleted earlier pink-paper draft of the first three verses for use as a paste-on in the poem
<title render="doublequote">Thought
</title> (section 9 of
<title render="doublequote">Chants Democratic
</title> in the 1860
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>; see 2:1:3). On the verso appear heavily revised draft verses, in pencil and only partly deleted, for sections 22 and 23. Leaf 6 ("What is there more that I lag and pause?"): full leaf (15 x 9 cm.) with
six paste-ons in light ink and black ink, and with heavy revisions in the same inks and in pencil. The final paste-on corresponds to sections 18-20 of the 1860 version, but the other paste-ons and the original
leaf contain drafts for the rest of the poem (sections 21-23). Leaf 7 ("O how your fingers drowse me!"): full leaf (15 x 9 cm.) with two paste-ons, the first a large section (13 x 9 cm.) of the same blue paper and
the second a small section (6.5 x 10.5 cm.) of white wove paper. The white paste-over is inscribed in light ink with no revisions; the blue paste-over is inscribed in medium-black ink, with extensive revisions in
pencil and in the same ink, as with the deleted verses on the original page. The white paste-on corresponds to section 21 in the 1860 version, and the blue paste-on contains the latest draft of what would become
sections 22 and 23. In 1860 this was the final poem in
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>; in 1867 Whitman cut twenty-one lines (according to Bradley and Blodgett) and transferred it to the end of the last
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title> supplement
<title render="doublequote">Songs of Parting.
</title> In 1872, with the transformation of this supplement into the cluster
<title render="doublequote">Songs Before Parting,
</title> it was permanently fixed as the final poem in the main body of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>.

<title render="italic">Leaves

<title render="doublequote">Leaves of Grass

<title render="italic">Passage to India

Primer/ middling wide measure" in the upper left corner of the first leaf, and on the verso of the second wrote and deleted (also in pencil) the note "The worship of God is, honoring his gifts/ in other men, each
according to his genius, &#38;/ loving the greatest men best. Those who/ envy or calumniate great men, hate God/ William Blake[.]" After being bound with the rest of the

</title> this is a revision of the first four verses of a draft poem by that name, inscribed by Whitman in a twenty-nine page notebook before the first edition of

</title> appeared in 1855. (The
<title render="doublequote">Pictures
</title> notebook is currently housed at Yale University.) Bradley and Blodgett note that after further revision Whitman published these verses in the October 30, 1880 issue of
<title render="italic">The American

<title render="doublequote">My Picture-Gallery,
</title> after which he placed it in the new cluster

                  <p>On nine leaves of different types of white paper, all measuring roughly 25 x 19.5 cm., described individually as follows. Other drafts of the poem are housed in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection at the Library
of Congress, the Trent Memorial Collection at Duke University, and the T.E. Hanley Collection at the University of Texas.
<title render="doublequote">The Mystic Trumpeter
</title> was first published in the February 1872 issue of
<title render="italic">The Kansas Magazine
</title>, after which Whitman published it in the 1872 book
<title render="italic">As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free
</title>, in
<title render="italic">Two Rivulets
</title> (1876), and in the 1881 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass
</title>. There and in later editions of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title> the poem was included in the cluster
<title render="doublequote">From Noon to Starry Night.
</title> Leaf 1: on the verso of a sheet of laid, gray-ruled Department of Justice letterhead, dated "Washington...187[ ]" (see leaves 2 and 8). Inscribed in black ink, with extensive revisions first in pencil and
then in black ink. This is a later draft than leaf 2 of verses that would eventually constitute the first numbered section of the poem. Whitman's number "1" appears in orange crayon in the upper right corner of
the leaf. Leaf 2 ("Hark! some wild trumpeter&#8212;some/ strange musician!"): also on the verso (upside-down) of a leaf of the same Department of Justice letterhead. Inscribed in black ink, with heavy revisions in
the same ink, then in pencil and in fine pen (original ink?). Whitman deleted most of the lines, drafting them again and shifting many of them around on leaf 1. Leaf 3 ("Come nearer mystic/ trumpeter"): on a
composite leaf formed by pasting a small section (8 x 12 cm.) of unruled laid paper to a full sheet of laid paper, ruled in gray on recto. Inscribed in black ink, with extensive revisions in the same ink and in
pencil. After further revision these verses became section 2 of the published version. Leaf 4 ("Blow, trumpeter, free and clear&#8212;I/ follow thee,"): on a leaf of laid paper, gray-ruled on recto (see 6-7).
Inscribed in black ink, with revisions in the same, in pencil, and in orange crayon. Whitman's orange-crayon note "Serenity&#8212;cool fresh/ placidity&#8212;" runs lengthwise up the left margin to the top of the
page. After further revision these verses became section 3 of the published version. Leaf 5 ("Blow again trumpeter&#8212;and let/ the notes swell high,"): on one leaf of white wove paper, ruled in blue on verso.
Three sets of pinholes appear in the upper left corner. Inscribed in black ink, with revisions in the same. This is an early draft of lines Whitman would revise and expand in Leaf 6 to eventually form section 4 in
the published version. Leaf 6 ("Blow again, trumpeter, and/ for my sensuous eyes"): on the same paper as leaves 4 and 7. Inscribed partly in black ink and partly in pencil; the ink section is revised in the same
ink, in pencil, and in pink ink; the pencil section is revised in pencil, in brown-black ink (fine pen), and in pink ink. The pencil lines are written below the pencil note "see last part of Consuelo vol 5th," by
which Whitman apparently meant the novel
<title render="italic">Consuelo
</title> by George Sand, a book from which he made frequent borrowings. This was a later draft of lines on leaf 7; the number "4" appears in orange crayon at the top of the leaf. Leaf 7 ("Blow again, trumpeter
and/ bring before me now,"): on a leaf of the same paper as leaves 4 and 6. Inscribed in black ink, with revisions in the same, in brown ink, and in pink ink. At the foot of the leaf Whitman wrote the
parenthetical note "(see last vol. of Consuelo)" with a cartoon hand pointing to it; at this point he revised the ink lines on leaf 6, consulted
<title render="italic">Consuelo
</title>, and drafted his new pencil verses on the other leaf. Leaf 8 ("Blow again trumpeter and/ for thy theme..."): on the verso of a leaf of Department of Justice letterhead (see leaves 1-2), inscribed in black
ink, with revisions in pink ink and then black ink. The pink ink was mostly applied with a broader nib here than in earlier leaves. Whitman's note "the piece must move on/ not lag/ sentimental" runs up the left
margin to the top of the page. These trial verses, many of them incomplete, were revised to form section 5 in the published version of the poem. Leaf 9 ("Blow again trumpeter/ and give/ for me/ now/ Thy war notes'
magic spell"): on a leaf of white wove paper, blue-ruled on verso. Multiple pinholes in the center-left portion of the leaf. Inscribed and revised in black ink. In the lower right corner of the leaf appears a
cryptic blue-crayon note in Whitman's hand: "Hah!"

                  <p>On the verso of a light blue Williamsburgh (N.Y.) tax form, dated "185[ ]," cut down to 20 x 12 cm. The corners are cropped diagonally. Multiple pinholes in center. Inscribed in pencil and revised in pencil and
brown-black ink (fine pen). Two sets of deleted verses constitute adaptations of lines from Whitman's pre-1855 unpublished notebook
<title render="doublequote">Pictures
</title>: "Now this is the fable of the/ mirror:/ The mirror lay clouded, (enveloped)/ enmisted," and "And/ Now this is the fable of a/ beautiful statue:/ A beautiful statue was lost/ but not destroyed[.]" Two
other deleted titles of fables(?) appear above the verses: "The trained runner" and "The five old men." At the foot of the leaf appears the note "last piece/ (still another Death Song&#8212;/ Death Song/ with
prophecies[.]" All of the sections are demarcated with horizontal lines. Based on Whitman's use of the tax blank, this appears to be a set of notes he made between 1857 and 1859 while preparing the 1860 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass
</title>, although the
<title render="doublequote">Poem of Fables
</title> as such never materialized and Whitman's
<title render="doublequote">Pictures
</title> were not published in their entirety until 1925. Whitman's executor Richard Maurice Bucke published these notes on p. 176 of his
<title render="italic">Notes and Fragments
</title> (1899).

                  <p>Many of these fragmentary notes were eventually used in or informed the long initial poem of
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass
</title>, that became (as Bradley and Blodgett note)
<title render="doublequote">Poem of Walt Whitman, an American
</title> in the 1856 edition and
<title render="doublequote">Walt Whitman
</title> in 1860, a title which it retained until 1881, when it was permanently renamed
<title render="doublequote">Song of Myself.
</title> (Leaves apparently unrelated to the
<title render="doublequote">Song
</title> are included in this description by virtue of being bound with
<title render="doublequote">Song
</title> drafts.) Generally the dating is quite early. All but three of the leaves were at one point in the possession of Whitman's executor Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke, who transcribed them (often with significant
errors or verses later removed from these fragments) in
<title render="italic">Notes and Fragments: Left by Walt Whitman...
</title> (1899) and his 1902 edition of the
<title render="italic">Complete Writings of Walt Whitman
</title>; page numbers to his transcriptions in
<title render="italic">Notes
</title> are provided with each relevant entry here. Although Whitman used a wide range of paper-types for these fragments, five kinds of paper can be identified. These are assigned letters as follows. Type A:
off-white notebook paper with light brown vertical lines running up the left and right margins, three on one side and one on the other. See Leaves 1, 8, 12, 20, and 28. A full leaf of the notebook paper seems to
have measured 19 x 15.5 cm. Type B: white wove paper, ruled in light blue-gray on both sides. See Leaves 3, 5, 21-22, and 27. No full sheet of this paper is present in the volume. Type C: light blue laid
Williamsburgh (N.Y.) tax forms, dated "185[ ]," and used extensively by Whitman in preparing his 1860 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves and Grass.
</title> Described by Fredson Bowers in his work on the 1860
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>-related Barrett manuscripts also listed and described above. A full tax form measures 21.5 x 12 cm. See Leaves 4 and 34. Type D: yellow and green wove proof sheets used, it seems, for trial printings of
the title page of the first edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass.
</title> See Leaves 7, 24-25, and 30-31. Type E: white laid paper ruled in brown on both sides. See Leaves 9-11, 13, 15-16, and 23. The dimensions of a full leaf of the paper cannot be determined from these
fragments.

(as Bucke transcribes it), providing closure to these particular verses, or it could just as easily read "an," indicating that a continuation of the lines has been lost. Although never published verbatim, these
lines prefigure section 6, especially beginning with the line "Here is the test of wisdom," of what would become

down) on the verso of several deleted pencil lines beginning "I think there will never be any more heaven or hell/ than there is now," preceded by two undeleted lines beginning "Whatever I say of myself, you shall
apply to yourself..." On p. 25 of
<title render="italic">Notes and Fragments
</title> Bucke publishes the undeleted and deleted sections together, along with lines from other manuscripts, as a single poem. An intermediate draft can be seen on p. 44. The deleted lines were revised to form
what would eventually become the second verse paragraph of section 3 of
<title render="doublequote">Song of Myself,
</title> while the undeleted line above them eventually formed part of section 20. After heavy revision the undeleted recto lines were used in what would be section 41 of
<title render="doublequote">Song of Myself.
</title> Another version became an unnumbered section (beginning "I will take an egg out of the robin's nest in the orchard,") of the poem
<title render="doublequote">Debris
</title> in the 1860 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>. It was the only appearance of these lines in any edition, and of the poem
<title render="doublequote">Debris
</title> under that title and as a unified text, although some other sections became separate poems under individual titles in later editions. But the lines also bear a strong resemblance to the poem beginning
"Priests!/ Until you can explain a paving stone, do not try to explain God...," reprinted by Bucke on p. 89, and to the concluding lines of the 1855 poem that would eventually (in 1881) become
<title render="doublequote">A Song for Occupations.

half of the main leaf. These lines, deleted with a single pencil stroke, appear on the verso of undeleted pencil lines beginning (extrapolating from Bucke's transcription) "[As we are content and dumb/ the amount]
of us in men/ and women is content and/ dumb," although someone has removed the words presented here in brackets, perhaps to emphasize the more finished nature of the lines on the present recto. Those verses are
inscribed in brown ink, extensively revised in the same ink and in pencil deletion. After heavy revision and expansion they eventually formed part of section 21 of the cluster
<title render="doublequote">Calamus
</title> in the 1860 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>; in the 1867 edition this section received the title
<title render="doublequote">That Music Always Round Me.

verso and recto, respectively; these numbers, along with remnants of paste and binding tape along the left margin of the recto, suggest that the type A pages came from a notebook. The lines on the recto are
inscribed, revised, and deleted (with a single stroke) in pencil, and appear on the verso of undeleted notes inscribed and revised in brown-black ink with some revisions in pencil. The verso notes begin with a
list of animals and plants ("cottonwood&#8212;mulberry&#8212;/chickadee&#8212;large brown water-dog"), followed by a verse ("The suicide/ went to a lonesome place...") that Whitman revised for use ("The suicide
sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,") in what would eventually constitute section 8 of
<title render="doublequote">Song of Myself.
</title> This verse is followed by another section of the natural "catalogue" ("locust, birch/ cypress..."), below which appears a pair of verses (beginning "O dirt, you corpse&#8212;I reckon you are good
manure&#8212;") used in what would be section 48 of the
<title render="doublequote">Song.
</title> ("And as to you corpse I think you are good manure..."). The list of flora and fauna could anticipate any number of similar lists in Whitman, but bears the strongest resemblance to section 29 of
<title render="doublequote">Poem of Joys
</title> (final title:
<title render="doublequote">A Song of Joys
</title>), which first appeared in the 1860 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves

<title render="doublequote">The Sleepers
</title> in 1872 (section 14, stanzas 44-46) and 1876 (also section 14, 44-46), at which point the lines were permanently removed from this poem and

leaves indicates that this was probably the second of the four
<title render="doublequote">Lucifer
</title> drafts, written before he decided to merge his commentary on slavery with allusions to the fallen angel of Isaiah. The trial lines on the verso (beginning "His very aches are exstasy") seem to have been
revised for inclusion in what is now section 29 of
<title render="doublequote">Song of Myself.
</title> Whitman's unusual spelling of "ecstasy" indicates not only that the lines came very early in the process of writing
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>, but that these lines may have originally been part of the proto-
<title render="doublequote">Song of Myself
</title> before being transferred to what would become
<title render="doublequote">The Sleepers.
</title> The verso lines and the words "I am a curse" link this leaf, like leaves 10 and 11, to two sections of draft verses in the earliest Library of Congress notebook (#80) beginning "Fierce wrestler!" and "I
am a curse:" (see p. 77 of Grier's
<title render="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts

sections. Several pinholes are clustered at the bottom of the leaf, in the center, indicating that this was originally the upper section of a full leaf. Inscribed and extensively revised in pencil. The deleted
first line reads "I am a hell-name and a Curse..." This seems to have been the last of the four
<title render="doublequote">Lucifer
</title> leaves to be inscribed, although it was further revised for publication in the 1855 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>. The word "Sleepchaser's" appears in the upper right corner, perhaps indicating that Whitman was considering a title similar to the 1860 and 1867 title
<title render="doublequote">Sleep-Chasings
</title> even before the poem was first published in 1855, unless this is in fact a reworking of the section for the 1860 edition. The possibility of a post-1855 dating, however, appears to be slight given the
similarities of paper choice and inscription techniques among leaves 9-11 and their shared similarities to drafts in the earliest Library of Congress notebook.

(in the center) indicate that this was originally the lower section of a full leaf, although the excision patterns along the top edge of this leaf and the lower edge of Leaf 10 do not seem to match up. This leaf,
a reworking of the lines beginning "I am a Curse" in Library of Congress notebook #80, with verses added from Leaf 9, appears to have come third in the revision process. The only line specifically linking the poem
to the theme of slavery ("I look off the river with my bloodshot eyes, after/ the steamboat that carries away my woman.&#8212;"), adapted from Leaf 9, is deleted, and Whitman apparently rejected these lines and
the "curse" theme in general as he moved towards the draft on Leaf 10, which would eventuate in the 1855 published version. On the verso (upside-down) appear two sets of trial verses for what would eventually
become the second verse paragraph of section 4 of the poem
<title render="doublequote">Faces,
</title> which in 1855 was published as the sixth of twelve poems in the first edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves

version of notes on a manuscript currently housed at Rutgers University, and printed by Bucke on pp. 162-63 of
<title render="italic">Notes and Fragments
</title>, although the Leaf 14 notes, like the
<title render="doublequote">Song of Myself
</title> verses on the recto, do not appear in Bucke. (For another version of the Rutgers notes, partially transcribed by Bucke, see Leaf 36 below.) Grier notes that the Rutgers manuscript probably dates to 1856
or afterwards, when Whitman was pursuing a self-education in poetry, suggesting that the verso notes also date to that period.

<title render="doublequote">Poem of The Child That Went Forth, and Always Goes Forth, Forever and Forever

The laid paper was originally the last page of a letter; a few illegible words and part of a signature can be seen dimly through the back of the composite leaf. Whitman wrote his lines on the verso of the page
after turning it sideways. Although Whitman did not use the verses word for word, they may have been part of an early draft of the fourth poem in the 1855 edition of

<title render="doublequote">Leaves of Grass
</title> in the 1860
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>, and eventually titled
<title render="doublequote">You Felons on Trial in Courts.
</title> (See 2:2:1 under
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass
</title> [1860] for a much later version of the poem.) Whitman's careful script and verse forms here also resemble the methods of inscription used for the
<title render="doublequote">Live Oak, with Moss
</title> poems dated by Bowers to the post-1856, pre-1860 period. The undeleted notes on the back are titled
<title render="doublequote">Poems
</title> and begin with the lines "A cluster, (same style, as of sonnets li[ke]/ as 'Calamus Leaves')/ of poems, verses, thoughts &#38;c, embodying/ religious emotions/ &#38; thoughts." A cartoon hand in the left
margin points to the phrase "religious emotions." Whitman's use of the title
<title render="doublequote">Calamus Leaves
</title> dates these notes to the same pre-1860 period as the deleted verses on the recto, since
<title render="doublequote">Calamus-Leaves
</title> was what he renamed the cluster
<title render="doublequote">Live Oak, with Moss
</title> before settling on
<title render="doublequote">Calamus
</title> for the 1860 edition. A section of the notes below the rest (beginning "spirituality&#8212;the unknown,...") is inscribed in verse form. Bucke prints these, along with [Full of wickedness, I...], on p. 39
of
<title render="italic">Notes and Fragments

use of the word "Libertad" and way of handling the theme of immigration suggest that this might be part of an early draft of the poem eventually known as

pencil, and on the verso in light brown ink and pencil. The verso lines (beginning "[sl]ueing,/...[be]nding,/...halt in the shade,") represent a fragment of a polished pre-1855-publication draft&#8212;almost a
fair copy, but with interesting revisions nonetheless&#8212;of lines that would eventually belong in section 13 of
<title render="doublequote">Song of Myself.
</title> These verses are inscribed along the ruled lines. Whitman cannibalized this leaf at some point after 1855 to jot down the recto verses perpendicular to the ruled lines. These seem to constitute a complete
but very early draft of the poem
<title render="doublequote">To One Shortly To Die,
</title> first published in the 1860 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass
</title> in the cluster
<title render="doublequote">Messenger Leaves.
</title> (For a later draft see Leaf 28, and for an even later version inscribed shortly before the 1860 publication see 2:3:1 in
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass
</title> [1860].) In the upper right corner of the recto appear the words "note/ last page of 'Ghost-seers'" in Whitman's hand, suggesting that he had considered forming a cluster under this title, never
published, in
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>, perhaps in the 1860 edition. The phrase "Ghost-seers" recalls a statement regarding Emerson in
<title render="doublequote">Leaves-Droppings,
</title> a section of correspondence and commentary Whitman appended to the 1856 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title>: "[Emerson] sees the future of truths as our Spirit-seers discern the future of man..." Bucke prints the recto verses on p. 13 of

beneath the verses, indicating (along with the finished appearance of the lines) that Whitman conceived of this when written as an independent poem. He may have used it, however, in the 1856
<title render="doublequote">Poem of Remembrances for A Girl or A Boy of These States,
</title> which, as Bradley and Blodgett note, became the sixth poem in
<title render="doublequote">Chants Democratic and Native American
</title> in 1860. It was subsequently shortened by several stanzas (1867) and retitled (1872)
<title render="doublequote">Think of the Soul
</title> before being excluded from
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title> with the publication of the 1881 edition. The verses on Leaf 29 combine the meanings expressed in both the excluded and preserved sections of

indicating&#8212;along with the damaging of the words "The gripe" in the last line by cutting and the appearance of the tops of other letters above the lower edge&#8212;that this was the upper section of a larger
leaf before Whitman decided to make it an independent poem, adding his characteristic period and hyphen combination at the end of the lines to mark its separateness. Inscribed in brown-gray ink, with revisions in
the same ink, in pencil, and in a darker brown ink (in that order). Bucke prints the verses on p. 26 of
<title render="italic">Notes and Fragments
</title> with the annotation "Early or middle fifties, never used," but the lines bear a strong resemblance to a section of prose on p. vi of the preface to the 1855 edition of

</title> A few pinholes are scattered around the page. The words "Have I" at the beginning are inscribed on a small scrap of the same paper, which Whitman pasted over some deleted words in the upper right corner
that cannot be discerned through the paper. Inscribed and extensively revised in pencil, these verses were part of a larger set of lines before Whitman cut away and (apparently) discarded the rest. Although the
page number and many words on the left side of the proof have been cut away, the remaining words identify it as p. 188 from the
<title render="doublequote">Poem of Many in One,
</title> which eventually became
<title render="doublequote">By Blue Ontario's Shore.
</title> These unused but also undeleted lines may have been intended for that poem or a number of other poems in

Although these poetic notes are difficult to date, they may represent an intermediate stage between the 1855 Preface to
<title render="italic">Leaves
</title> and the 1856
<title render="doublequote">Poem of Many in One
</title> (eventually
<title render="doublequote">By Blue Ontario's Shore
</title>), which cast many sentences similar to these from the Preface in poetic form. Two editorial errors relating to the leaf should be mentioned: Bucke prints the fragment on p. 169 as a prose passage, and in
republishing Bucke's transcription (still in prose form) Grier reports, on p. 1941 of the
<title render="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts
</title> (vol. 5) that this manuscript has not been found.

that one or more verses were cut away and discarded; this is corroborated by the fact that the final word, "gaunt," ends not with a period but with a comma. Whitman's use of the tax form and the strong similarity
this fragment bears (as Bradley and Blodgett note) both to the 1856
<title render="doublequote">Poem of the Road
</title> (later
<title render="doublequote">Song of the Open Road
</title>) and to the 1860
<title render="doublequote">Proto-Leaf
</title> (eventually
<title render="doublequote">Starting from Paumanok
</title>) indicate that this may have been a revision of the former poem or, as seems more likely, an early draft of
<title render="doublequote">Proto-Leaf
</title> intended for the 1860 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves

larger set before Whitman decided to make them an independent poem, adding a hyphen at the end of the last line and cutting off the verses below. (The word "nothing" in the last line was partly cut away as well.)
Although written in free verse, the rather conventional nature of this poem suggests an early date of inscription. Bucke does not transcribe it.

smudged with erased words, and largely worn away&#8212;has been reinforced with a strip of light brown wove paper pasted to the verso. Inscribed in pencil, with one minor revision in brown ink. The leaf is divided
with horizontal lines into four sections: "Pentameter," "Anapest," "Dithyrambus/ Dithyramb/ Dithyrambic," and "Caesura." Like the contents of the verso of Leaf 14, these notes represent a version of the poetic
definitions that appear in a manuscript currently housed at Rutgers University. Bucke prints the final two sections of these notes on p. 163 of

                  <p>These two manuscripts represent different stages, earlier and later, in the evolution of a poem written during October and November 1873 and first published as
<title render="doublequote">Song of the Redwood-Tree
</title> in the February 1874 issue of
<title render="italic">Harper's Magazine
</title>. From a note prefacing the first manuscript, as Bowers writes, it appears that Whitman personally took charge of gathering and preserving the manuscripts. In 1876, Bradley and Blodgett observe, Whitman
published the poem in the independent group
<title render="doublequote">Centennial Songs
</title> and in this group as annexed to
<title render="italic">Two Rivulets
</title>, and in 1881 it appeared, ungrouped, in
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass
</title>. For convenience these descriptions follow the ordering of the leaves presented by Bowers in his article

                     <p>This rough draft begins with the following note, inscribed and initialed by Whitman in brown-black ink, on one piece (17.5 x 22.5 cm.) of thin, light brown wove paper with no pinholes: "Camden,/ Oct. &#38; Nov.
'73./ Song of the Redwood Tree./ (rough draft&#8212;mems,/ printed sketch,/ letter from Harper's Mag.)/ &#38;c./ W. W." The other leaves are described individually as follows. Unless noted otherwise, each leaf
features multiple pinholes in its center. Leaf 2 ("Song of the Redwood/ Tree/ &#38; other pieces"): white wove paper (20.5 x 12.5 cm.), apparently a flyleaf or blank page removed from a book. The undeleted title
as well as the deleted titles
<title render="doublequote">Eid&#243;lons
</title> (on both recto and verso, but upside-down relative to the undeleted title) and
<title render="doublequote">Waves in the Vessel's Wake
</title> (also upside-down) are inscribed in blue crayon, while the line "Waves, undulating/ waves&#8212;" (on verso, upside-down) is in grey-black ink.
<title render="doublequote">Eid&#243;lons
</title> was the title Whitman used for a poem first published in 1876; and
<title render="doublequote">Waves in the Vessel's Wake,
</title> according to Bradley and Blodgett, was an alternate title for a poem eventually named
<title render="doublequote">After the Sea-Ship,
</title> in which the line "Waves, undulating/ waves&#8212;" can be found. Leaf 3 (
<title render="doublequote">A California song./ Song of the Redwood/ Tree
</title>): white wove paper (20 x 12.5 cm.), ruled on both sides. The page contains four sections of pencil notes in prose and verse, with the title
<title render="doublequote">A California song
</title> (which became the first verse of the published poem) in medium black ink, and the second title, along with notes dating the second section to "Oct. '73" and the third section to "Nov. '73/ Camden," in
blue crayon. In pencil Whitman also drew a cartoon hand pointing to the sentence "Use this point to express/ fully my California views" in the second section. Leaf 4 ("A mighty tree is/ falling."): white wove
paper (20.5 x 13 cm.), ruled on recto. In pencil (on recto), with extensive pencil revisions. The verses on this leaf represent an early draft of numbered sections 1 and 2 of the published poem. On the verso
(perpendicular to the recto verses) appear notes, deleted in pencil, for "(a sonnet)" written "for Century Verses," which appears from a Library of Congress manuscript to have been a working title of the group
that became
<title render="doublequote">Centennial Verses
</title> in 1876. After heavy revision (see verso of leaf 5) the poem became the title-page epigraph to the 1876 (
<title render="doublequote">Come, said my Soul
</title>) and several later editions of
<title render="italic">Leaves</title>. The incomplete verso lines are in brown black ink with extensive revisions in the same ink. Leaf 5: on the same type of paper as 4, torn down to 20.5 x 13 cm. Recto is inscribed and extensively revised
in pencil; these verses represent an early draft of section 3 of the published poem. On the verso ("Go said my Soul, the real Me,") appears a deleted later draft of the poem whose notes appear on the verso of Leaf
4. The verso lines are inscribed in brown-black ink with extensive revisions in the same ink, in blue crayon, and in pencil, apparently in that order. Leaf 6 ("So for a type for you, your/ race, Pacific lands"):
white laid paper (20.5 x 12.5 cm.), ruled on verso. Inscribed in pencil and medium black pen, with heavy revisions in both of these, particularly the pencil, and in light ink. Whitman inscribed the pencil note
"last," enclosed in a semicircle, in the upper right corner. After further revision these verses became the last italicized verse paragraph of section 4 of the 1876 version of the poem. Leaf 7 ("(The teamsters,
choppers, chain/ and jackscrew men/ heard not...)"): White quadrille paper (21 x 13.5 cm.), at one point folded in thirds. Inscribed and extensively revised in pencil. These lines were further revised to form the
second and third verse paragraphs of section 2 in the 1876 version of the poem. Leaf 8 ("Lands of the Western shore!"): inscribed in medium black ink on the verso of p. [1] of a letter (18 x 11 cm.) cut from a fold
of what Bowers characterizes as fine tinted laid paper. The verses are inscribed perpendicular to the sentences of the letter. Revised in the main ink and in a lighter ink. These verses were further revised to
form the closing section (6) of the 1876 version of the poem. The letter, deleted in blue crayon, is dated "Boston./ 96 Washington St/ 30 Sept '73" and was written by Boston lawyer Albert B. Otis. In it, Otis
expresses his happiness on learning that Whitman's health is improving, thanks him for sending a paper with news of the recovery, and mentions his wish to obtain copies of Whitman's new works as they appear.
Whitman used the verso of the second part of the letter as Leaf 3 of the second manuscript of
<title render="doublequote">Song of the Redwood-Tree
</title> (see below). Leaf 9 ("The Cascade range/ On the Pacific&#8212;..."): white wove paper (20.5 x 13 cm.), ruled on both sides, with (as Bowers notes) the embossed device of Mercury's winged hat and a
caduceus in the upper left corner. Whitman began writing a letter on this page before using it for verse: deleted lines at the top read "431 Stevens st./ cor West" and "Camden,/ Saturday forenoon/ Oct. 25." These
trial verses are inscribed in the same medium brown ink as the letter heading, except for the final verse, which appears finished and is written in black ink. Revisions are in the main ink and in a lighter ink.
After further revision these verses were incorporated in sections 4 and 5 of the 1876 version of the poem. Leaf 10 ("As of the wood-spirits'/ voices ancient, rustly, speaking,"): inscribed on the same paper as
Leaf 9, with the same embossed device (reversed, in upper right corner), in medium black ink, with revisions in the same ink and in light ink and the first and last sections deleted. The top deleted section
includes several false starts, along with the draft line "A new Man/ and a new empire" in the upper right corner. The undeleted verses were revised to form part of section 4 in the 1876 version of the poem. Leaf
11 ("Farewell/ My time has ended, my term has/ come,&#8212;"): on the same paper as Leaf 6, also in pencil, with extensive revisions and deletions in the same. Only the verse quoted here was allowed to stand; it
was used as the final line of section 1 in the 1876 version of the poem. Leaf 12 ("or chorus of dryads, fading, departing"): inscribed on the verso of a letter (22.5 x 17.5 cm.) from Whitman family friend Abby H.
Price to Whitman's sister-in-law Mrs. George (Louisa Orr) Whitman. The letter and verses are on blue-tinted wove paper. Whitman's lines run perpendicular to the letter's, and are in brown-black ink, with revisions
in the same. Multiple pinholes at top and bottom of Whitman's verses rather than in center. The first verse became part of section 1 in the 1876 version, and the rest of the verses on the leaf were revised to form
section 5. The letter is written in brown-black ink (deleted with a blue crayon stroke), and is dated "New York. Oct 17th." In it, Abby Price tells Louisa Whitman of her dismay in reading newspaper reports that
Walt Whitman "'is...dangerously ill'" and asks her for more news. Leaf 13 ("Thus on the northern coast/ in the lumber-men's camp"): on white laid paper (20.5 x 15 cm.), ruled on both sides, inscribed in brown-
black ink and pencil, with extensive revisions and notes from Whitman to himself in the same. After further revision these lines became the final verse paragraph of section 4 in the 1876 version of the poem. Leaf
14 ("Nor these alone&#8212;not dedicate to these/ alone,..."): inscribed on the verso of a letter dated 1873 October 15 (21 x 12.5 cm.) to Whitman from his friend Charley [Eldridge]. On white laid paper, ruled on both sides, and
embossed with the letters "P &#38; P" (inside a decorative border) in the upper left corner. In medium-black ink, with three false starts, a paragraph mark, and revisions in the same. Whitman's lines run
perpendicular to the letter's. After further revision these lines were incorporated in the first few verses of section 6 of the 1876 version of the poem. In the letter, dated "Washington Oct 15. 1873" and deleted
with a single blue crayon stroke, Eldridge reports collecting various articles of Whitman's clothing, with Whitman's companion Peter Doyle, from a room the poet kept in Washington, D.C., and sending them via Adams
Express. Leaf 15 ("(Surely I did not dream)"): on white wove paper (20 x 12.5 cm.), ruled on both sides, and embossed in one corner with the die of the Juniata Mills, Pennsylvania. Inscribed in medium black ink,
with revisions in the same. These trial verses were revised and expanded to become the final italicized verse paragraph of section 3 of the 1876 version of the poem. Leaf 16 ("The influences of nature,"): on white
wove paper (19.5 x 12.5 cm.), ruled on recto. In pencil, with extensive revisions in the same. These verses were further revised and incorporated in the final italicized paragraph of section 4 in the 1876 version
of the poem. Leaf 17 ("The tree prophecies"): on a section of white laid paper (torn down to 15.5 x 12 cm.) embossed with what appears to be the same paper-maker's die as leaf 14, but only ruled on recto.
Inscribed and revised in pencil. The pinholes are positioned near the top of the leaf. These trial verses express the themes of much of the finished poem. Leaf 18 ("The spinal idea of/ the poem"): on white wove
paper (19.5 x 12 cm.), ruled on both sides. Inscribed and revised in pencil. This combination of prose and poetic notes provides an overview of the entire poem. Leaf 19 ("...or seemed to say"): on white wove paper
(19 x 12 cm.), ruled on both sides. Inscribed and revised in pencil. These verses were further revised and incorporated in sections 3 and 4 of the published poem in 1876. Leaf 20 ("Lessons to the/ race to grow"):
on a fragment of white wove paper torn down to 11 x 12.5 cm., ruled on verso. Inscribed in pencil. Pinholes at foot of fragment, i.e., in the center of the original page, and in the current center. These trial
verses provide an outline of most of the italicized passages (representing the Redwood's voice) in the published poem.

                     <p>Leaves described individually as follows. Unless otherwise noted, pinholes are clustered at the center of each leaf. Whitman also numbered each leaf in blue crayon in the upper right corner of the page. Leaf 1:
on a composite leaf made of two fragments (12.5 x 19 and 5.5 x 12.5 cm.) of different kinds of white laid paper (the bottom fragment ruled on recto, the top not ruled) pasted together. The top set of verses is
inscribed in brown-black ink and revised in pencil and in the original ink; the bottom lines are inscribed in pencil, with revisions in the brown-black ink. Whitman numbered this section in blue crayon. Pinholes
in center of each part of the composite leaf. With a small amount of further revision this leaf became section 1 of the published poem. Leaf 2 ("Along the northern coast,"): on a leaf of white laid paper torn down
to 12.5 x 19.5 cm.; the watermark "[HAND?]MADE" is partly visible. On the back appear pencil notes in Whitman's hand for a letter regarding a painting or photograph of Whitman(?); this draft letter is deleted in
blue crayon. The verses are inscribed in brown-black ink, with revisions in the same ink, in pencil, and in blue crayon. Whitman also numbered this section in blue crayon. After a small amount of further revision
these lines became the first verse paragraph of section 2 in the published version. Leaf 3 ("The choppers haply heard not&#8212;the/ camp-shanties echoed not,"): on the verso of p. [2] (17.5 x 11 cm.)
of the Albert B. Otis letter, 1873 September 30, used for leaf 8 of the rough draft manuscript (see above); this part of the letter is also deleted with a blue crayon stroke. The verses are inscribed in medium black ink, with
revisions in the same ink and in pencil. After further revision they became the second and third verse paragraphs of section 2 in the published version. Leaf 4 ("You untold life of me,"): on three sections of
unruled white laid paper from the same page (15 x 13, 5.5 x 13, and 6 x 13 cm.) joined by means of two irregular fragments of white ruled paper pasted to the back. The ruled fragments contain ink and pencil notes
for the poem, but at a very early stage of development. The recto verses are inscribed in medium black ink and revised in the same ink, in pencil, and in blue crayon. Whitman also numbered this section 3 in blue
crayon: it became the first verse paragraph of that section in the 1876 version. In pencil, he added the note "ital" in the upper left corner and underlined almost every verse to indicate that the Tree's voice
should be printed in italics. As Bowers notes, Whitman cut up and rearranged this page to reverse the order of the lines on the second and third sections of paper. Leaf 5 ("N[or yie]ld we mournfully, majestic
brothers,"): on a composite leaf formed of two sections of paper pasted together; the top section (10 x 15 cm.), damaged along the top edge, is of the same kind of paper used for leaf 13 of the rough draft and
leaves 8 and 9 of this draft, and the bottom section (18.5 x 13 cm.) is of white wove paper, ruled on one side. The verses are inscribed in brown-black ink with heavy revisions in the same ink and in pencil. After
further revision these sections became the second and third verse paragraphs, respectively, of section 3 of the poem. Leaf 6 ("Then to a loftier strain/ Still prouder, more extatic rose/ the chant,"): on two
sections of different kinds of white paper, the lower section (20 x 12.5 cm.; wove, ruled on one side) being pasted to the top one (10 x 13 cm.; laid, unruled). The lower section is inscribed on the verso of part
of a sheet of Department of Justice letterhead with the dateline "Washington...187[ ]," under which Whitman jotted down and deleted directions to the Hydropathic Institute in Wernersville (Pennsylvania) in blue
crayon. He also used blue crayon to designate the verses section 4, of which they became the first two paragraphs in the published version. The verses are inscribed in brown-black ink, with heavy revisions in the
same and in pencil. Whitman added the note "ital" after joining the two paper sections, and concomitantly underlined each verse of the lower section for the same reasons as in leaf 4. Leaf 7 ("You occult, deep
volitions"): on white wove paper (25.5 x 20 cm.), ruled on both sides. Inscribed in medium black ink, with revisions in the same, in pencil, and (possibly) in a lighter ink. The upper right corner is damaged,
leaving the leaf number partially missing, but it seems clear that the number was a 7. As Bowers notes, the deleted title
<title render="doublequote">You occult, deathless, deep volitions
</title> indicates that this was once an independent poem (as the existence of an early draft of the lines at Duke University would seem to confirm), but Whitman revised and italicized the lines&#8212;the note
"ital" and underlinings in pencil also appear here&#8212;for inclusion as the third paragraph of section 4 in the published version of
<title render="doublequote">Song of the Redwood-Tree.
</title> Leaf 8 ("For you, for man of you your characteristic race,"): on a section (21 x 16 cm.) of the same kind of paper used for leaves 5 (in part) and 9; inscribed in medium black ink, with extensive
revisions in the same, in pencil, and in what seems to be a lighter ink. The verses are all underlined in the lighter ink(?) using a fine pen. At the bottom of the leaf appear the words "Idaho, Utah" in blue
crayon. After further revision these lines became the fourth verse paragraph, and the final italicized one, of section 4 in the published version of the poem. Leaf 9 ("Thus on the northern coast,"): on a section
(20.5 x 16 cm.) of the same kind of paper used for leaves 5 (in part) and 8; inscribed in medium black ink, with revisions in the same ink, in a lighter ink, and in pencil. The number 5 appears at the top of the
leaf, obscured by the addition of new lines. In actuality these verses became the final paragraph of section 4 in the published version of the poem. Leaf 10 ("The flashing &#38; golden pageant of California,"): on
a section of white laid paper (21 x 20 cm.), in brown-black ink, with extensive revisions in the same ink, in a lighter ink, and in pencil. The blue-crayon section number 6 appears next to a deleted pencil 2 at
the top of the leaf; at the bottom appears the ink note "? Yosemite" separated from the lines with a semicircle. These verses were further revised to form section 5 of the published version. Leaf 11 ("But more in
you, than these, I see, lands of the western shore!"): on three sections of white wove paper (top: 7 x 20 cm., unruled; middle: 8 x 19.5 cm., unruled; foot: 10 x 20.5 cm., ruled) pasted together and jointly pasted
to a paper fragment (6.5 x 20 cm.) containing an earlier, deleted set of verses that are revised in the current top section. The top and concealed sections are both inscribed on the verso of fragments of a letter,
written in purple ink and deleted by Whitman in blue crayon, from the engraver W. J. Linton. As Bradley and Blodgett note, Linton produced a portrait of Whitman that the poet included in
<title render="italic">Two Rivulets
</title> and that also inspired the poem
<title render="doublequote">Out from Behind This Mask.
</title> In what remains of the letter Linton inquires after Whitman's health. The verses on this composite leaf were revised to form the sixth and final section of the published version of the poem.

                     <title render="doublequote">The Soul's Procession
</title> comprises very early notes for a projected poem that Whitman inscribed in a handmade notebook (20.5 x 13 cm.). This he made by folding in half seven leaves of white laid Philp &#38; Solomon (Washington,
D.C.) paper (measuring 25 x 19.5 cm. unfolded), ruled in blue on both sides (type A), in the direct middle of which he inserted a gathering of three folded leaves of a different kind of white laid paper (type B),
ruled horizontally in blue on both sides, but also featuring a single vertical rule in blue and red. This gathering is held together with a metal bracket, and is bound in with the main notebook pages by means of a
pink ribbon. Three sections of type B paper are also tipped in between bound type A pages. Inscribed and revised in black ink, in pencil, and in blue crayon. Although Whitman never finished or published
<title render="doublequote">The Soul's Procession
</title> during his lifetime, Bradley and Blodgett note that the same ideas worked out here inform many of his poems, particularly the 1871 independent publication
<title render="italic">Passage to India.
</title> For a transcription of the notebook with comprehensive annotations see Grier's
<title render="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts
</title>, vol. 4, pp. 1390-94. The earliest dating of the notebook is supplied by an 1869 newspaper clipping pasted to Leaf 3, but Grier speculates, based on the shakiness of Whitman's handwriting in later leaves,
that some of the notes may have been added after the poet suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1873. On the back cover appear pencil notes detailing train numbers, times, and (apparently) amounts of money.

to the lower left section of Leaf 3. The trial verse "My ship sails the sea/ in a storm" appears at the end of Whitman's prose notes and beneath the clipping, which documents the near-sinking of a steamship in the
Atlantic during a "furious gale." Inscribed in black ink, with a short horizontal line separating the note "In Soul's Procession" from the rest of the notes.

</title> number 13, in the 1860 edition of
<title render="italic">Leaves of Grass
</title>. That poem was later revised and published as
<title render="doublequote">Laws for Creations
</title>; however, the lines on this manuscript are a draft of the section of the poem that was deleted after the 1860 publication.

                  <p>On one leaf of white wove paper (22.5 x 13.5 cm.), in very dark brown-black ink, with revisions in the same ink and in pencil. Multiple pinholes just below center. At the top, which is damaged, can be seen a
title or notes for a different poem reading
<title render="doublequote">[One?] Song&#8212;Come Philander
</title>; the preliminary and incomplete draft of
<title render="doublequote">Three verses
</title> (with the note "2d or 3d verse" and a question mark at different points) appears beneath a horizontal line. Whitman apparently never revised the poem further, and it was never published. At some point the
leaf was folded in half, apparently to form part of a small notebook. On the verso appear two independent texts. One is a list of names and addresses (beginning with his brother and sisters "Jeff./ Mary/ Han[nah]"
and including his friends and supporters Mrs. [Anne Burrows] Gilchrist, W[illiam] M[ichael] Rossetti, and [Edward] Dowden) of people to whom Whitman had apparently mailed copies of an article or book; all but two
of the names are checked off in ink or in orange crayon. On the facing half-leaf, in pencil (mostly erased or deleted) and struck through with the same orange crayon, appear what seem to be notes for a newspaper
announcement, beginning "Walt Whitman, after an absence of almost three years, appeared again on Pennsylvania Avenue this forenoon." Based on this date it can be speculated that the notes were written late in 1875
(a possibility corroborated by the list of names), but the poem(s) may have been inscribed in the late 1860s or earlier.

appears on the verso of the second, above the date "187[ ]." Both pages are inscribed in black ink, with revisions in the same and in brown-black ink. The first two entries on Leaf 1 appear to contain general
notes for this poem; the second entry reads, "Make a demand for/ the Ideal, (or/ rather idea of the/ Ideal of the real)." This is followed by the note "in the piece," which leads up to several trial verses
eventually incorporated in the second verse paragraph of numbered section 5 of
<title render="doublequote">Thou Mother With Thy Equal Brood.
</title> Leaf 2 ("? Or&#8212;a song&#8212;a chant/ which shall sing&#8212;celebrate/&#8212;America..."): these general notes, ending with a cartoon hand singling out the lines "All the states/ East &#38; west,/
north &#38; south/ Brotherhood/ an equal union[,]" prefigure the whole poem, but particularly such lines as "South, North, West, East,/ (To thy immortal breasts, Mother of All, thy every daughter,/ son, endear'd
alike, forever equal,)" in the same section projected on Leaf 1.
