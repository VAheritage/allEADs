      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 200 items (1 Hollinger
         box), including 115 letters, 1943-1944, from Beecher Ray
         Burnett (1922- ?) to his wife, Anita Lester Burnett, written
         from Greensboro, North Carolina, and San Antonio, Texas, while
         training in the Army Air Corps, and ca. 75 items of
         memorabilia pertaining to his service in the Army Air Corps,
         removed from a scrapbook. Beecher Burnett was born in Roanoke,
         Virginia, to Abram Delmar Burnett (1882-[1935?]) and Bessie R.
         Sogren Burnett (1894- ?). He graduated from Jefferson High
         School, Roanoke, Virginia, in 1940, and then married Anita
         Lester the same year. He worked for the Norfolk &amp; Western
         Railway Company until he was inducted into the Armed
         Forces.</p>
      <p>The memorabilia removed from the scrapbook includes: news
         clippings; war department memoranda; letters of
         recommendation; Burnett's birth certificate; rosters; forms; a
         manual "Aviation Student Regulations A.A.F.C.C." Army Air
         Forces Classification Center, San Antonio, Aviation Cadet
         Center, San Antonio, Texas; receipts; church bulletins;
         schedules; Christmas greetings and a Christmas dinner menu and
         program at San Antonio; a handkerchief; dog tag; post cards
         and a map of San Antonio, Texas; military patch; tags; and a
         military pass while Burnett was at the 47th College Training
         Detachment (Air Crew) Marshall College, Huntington, West
         Virginia.</p>
      <p>The first group of letters were written by Beecher Burnett
         to Anita Burnett, Roanoke, Virginia, while he was assigned to
         the 1187 Training Group, 304th Wing, Barrack #438, Squadron
         "D," Basic Training Center #10, Greensboro, North Carolina.
         Most of Burnett's letters contain frank expressions of how
         much he misses his wife, both emotionally and sexually. They
         also provide an uncensored view of his daily reactions to the
         army and its routines.</p>
      <p>While at Greensboro in 1943, Burnett writes about:
         receiving his uniform and other gear ([Jul 31]); his need for
         an iron and other articles (Aug 1); a lecture and film on the
         gas mask drill, other drilling, and chemical warfare (Aug 2);
         films on articles of war, military courtesy, and sexual
         hygiene (Aug 2-3); various tests, warning not to repeat any
         information from his letters, necessity of her getting a job,
         and warning her to be faithful and careful around men,
         frequently repeated in subsequent letters (Aug 5); enjoyment
         of the day room and library on base, his frantic need to see
         his wife, and his worry over her answering a "war wives" ad
         (Aug 8); his efforts to get a pass to meet her in Greensboro,
         North Carolina (Aug 10); gas drills description (Aug 11); a
         brief hiatus when he spends some time with his wife in
         Greensboro (Aug 13-15); on guard duty (Aug 17); description of
         army skirmishes in the woods (Aug 19); rumors about the "rifle
         range" experience (Aug 22); expressions of extreme frustration
         over his wife's absence from him and anxiety about possible
         unfaithfulness (Aug 22, 23, 24); and life on the "rifle range"
         (Aug 25-29).</p>
      <p>Another gap in the correspondence occurs when his wife,
         Anita, joins Burnett in Huntington, West Virginia, while he
         attends the 47th College Training Detachment (Air Crew), U.S.
         Army Air Forces, Marshall College.</p>
      <p>From Huntington, West Virginia, Burnett travels to the Army
         Air Force Classification Center/San Antonio Aviation Cadet
         Center in San Antonio, Texas (1943 Nov 28) where he spends a
         good deal of time being processed and tested mentally and
         physically as to his ability to join a flight crew (Nov 29-Dec
         10). His tendency towards air sickness disqualifies him for
         flying and he discusses other positions to which he might be
         assigned (Dec 20). Burnett is re-classified as a non-combatant
         "pressure chamber technician" which will require one month of
         training in San Antonio (Dec 30).</p>
      <p>Burnett transferred to the 29th Altitude Training Unit
         (Pre-flight), San Antonio Aviation Cadet Center, at the
         beginning of 1944 and all of the remaining letters are for
         that year (1944 Jan 4). Burnett writes about receiving a gift
         box from Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company and going
         through the tear gas and chlorine gas chambers (Jan 7);
         description of his first trip to San Antonio and the results
         of his eye exam and his unusual eyes (Jan 8 &amp; 9); begins
         classes on flying and the development of pressure and altitude
         chambers up to the present, including an actual test run with
         the pressure chamber, and learning the use and repair of
         oxygen equipment (Jan 10-11); operating the pressure chamber
         (Jan 12, 17, 27); his extreme suspicion of his wife over
         having her photograph taken or possibly being around men (Jan
         22, 24, 25, &amp; 27); passing his final exam and officially
         becoming an Altitude Chamber Technician (Jan 29); adventures
         with ice skating (Jan 31 &amp; Feb 7); the visit of Chinese
         officers to the altitude chamber and their description of
         atrocities of the Japanese against the Chinese people (Feb 4
         &amp; 5). The letters end with Burnett still stationed with
         the 29th Altitude Training Unit in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
