        <p>These items were gifts to the Library from Colonel Alan
            Mackenzie of Holmes Beach, Florida, on January 27 and May
            2, 1989.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection contains three items: framed tenth and
         seventeenth century manuscript copies of pages from the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Shah Nameh</title>("King's Book of
         Kings" by the poet Firdausi (variations include "Ferdowsi" and
         "Fardusi"), in Persian (Arabic?), and a military police
         gorget, ca. 1950, from Afghanistan</p>
      <p>The 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Shah Nameh</title>(variously known as
         the Shah-nama or Shah-namah) was originally composed during
         the ninth century. It is a collection of episodes from the
         history of the Persian Empire and chronicles the reigns of
         fifty kings and queens from the creation of the world until
         the conquest of Persia by Islam during 636-641 A.D.</p>
      <p>Accession number 10769-A, a 9" x 11" copy dating from the
         tenth century, bears four columns of text on either side and
         was obtained in Kabul ca. 1950; it is encased in a glass frame
         mounted on a revolving stand. Accession number 10769-B dates
         from approximately the 1600s and depicts a scene of four men
         on horseback during a polo game(?) (the illustration possibly
         obstructs additional lines) with its accompanying text on the
         reverse. For additional information, consult Reuben Levy's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Epic of the Kings</title>(1967) and
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Shah-Nameh of Fardusi</title>(1973)
         by Alexander Rogers. [Another seventeenth-century manuscript
         copy is available in the Manuscripts Division of the Special
         Collections Department under accession number 6479.]</p>
      <p>The gorget, made of copper, was also obtained ca. 1950.
         According to the donor, it is a military police badge bearing
         an inscription which translates as "The Military Police of the
         Commanding General, Central Army Corps." This corps was
         headquartered in Kabul.</p>
