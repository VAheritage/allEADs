      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>There are three holograph manuscripts, 1772, relating to
         the ecorche horse print, "A Curious Print of a Beautiful
         Mare," painted by Francis Sartorius and engraved by Charles
         Grignion. There is a letter from the publisher Joseph Barber,
         Long Acre, London, to "My Lord Duke" [the Duke of
         Northumberland] requesting permission "to dedicate a print to
         your Grace, an account of which herewith inclose...," and
         praising "the Muscle Preparation," the painting and the
         engraving as being well executed. There is also a calligraphic
         manuscript entitled "Proposals For Publishing by Subscription,
         At Half a Guinea each, To be paid on delivery, A Curious Print
         of A Beautiful Mare," explaining how the myology will be
         illustrated and stating those artists involved: "By Jeremiah
         Bridges, Anatomist, from Oxford, deceased. Painted by Mr.
         Francis Sartorius, and engraved by Mr. Charles Grignion both
         of London." Also included is a manuscript beginning "The
         following Account was intended to have been published by the
         late Jeremiah Bridges, who was prevented by Sickness which
         occasioned his Death," giving details of anatomical errors by
         previous writers on the osteology of the horse.</p>
