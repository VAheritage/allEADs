      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The Secret Twelve Club (occasionally known as the "Secret
         12") was founded ca. 1912-1914 with twelve members, and is
         considered by some to be the oldest black social club in
         Charlottesville. Its exact date of founding is obscure but its
         anniversary is mentioned as February 22 (entries, January 8,
         1952, p. 106, and February 26, 1952, p. 117). This was
         initially a secret association partly due to fears that
         Charlottesville whites might suppress black clubs and
         retaliate against its members (afterward, whites learned of
         the club's existence but mostly ignored it; however some were
         invited as guests to various socials). Like similar fraternal
         organizations, the Secret Twelve employed passwords, secret
         grips and signs, and membership cards; members were addressed
         as "brother." The club's purposes were social and civic: to
         instill racial pride in blacks, serve as role model for black
         youth, provide counseling services for troubled youth, and, to
         raise funds for charity and groups such as the Red Cross and
         the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
         (NAACP).</p>
      <p>Membership was limited to fourteen Charlottesville and
         Albemarle County African-American males aged twenty-one or
         older (club members' average ages were the 30s and 40s but at
         the peak of the club's activities the average member was in
         his 60s or 70s). New members were solicited by word of mouth;
         an application form was required and potential members'
         backgrounds were investigated. Candidates had to be of good
         character, a registered voter, and regular churchgoer with no
         criminal record. Current members voted on new members; a
         majority vote was required. Most members were married,
         middle-class blacks (homeowners or renters) of professional or
         working classes.</p>
      <p>Officers included a president, vice-president,
         sergeant-at-arms, treasurer, secretary, and chaplain. Meetings
         began with prayer and the reading and approval of previous
         minutes. Dues were $2.00 per meeting (five dollars during the
         1990s); meetings rotated among members' homes or were held at
         a local Masonic lodge. Club funds were deposited at the
         National Bank; absences were fined and one year suspensions
         required of club members for disorderly conduct at meetings
         (September 27, 1953, p. 163)</p>
      <p>Among its social activities was the sponsoring of dances at
         the city's Carver Recreation Center and Elk's Home
         (invitations were by word of mouth, posters and flyers). Club
         socials were by invitation only, and each member could invite
         guests to these and other private parties; Christmas socials
         were held annually (January 1, 1951, p. 68). Bus trips and
         picnics were also sponsored to Prince Edward Lake (August 28,
         1951, p. 92) and Culpeper, Virginia (August 25, 1953, p. 160).
         "Widows' parties" were once-a-year galas for the propose of
         raising funds for the widows of deceased members. The Secret
         Twelve also collected and donated money to members' widows
         (for example, the club proposed to donate $25.00 to Mrs.
         Murray on January 9, 1951 following the death of her husband
         James); it also sent flowers and members served as pallbearers
         for the deceased wives of members (March 25, 1954, p. 172).
         "Sick dues" were collected (August 29, 1950, p. 59) during the
         illness or hospitalization of members or their wives to send
         get-well cards (fruit sent to Mrs. Susie Lewis, June 2, 1950,
         p. 52).</p>
      <p>Local charity and civic groups seeking donations were
         required to send a representative to club meetings to apply or
         else make such requests in writing. The ledger indicates club
         donations were distributed to the Albemarle Tuberculosis
         Association (November 28, 1950, p. 64); the NAACP (October 23,
         1951, p. 96), its campaign "For the Betterment of The Negro
         Patients at the University Hospital" (October 23, 1951, p.
         97), and its membership drive (February 23, 1954, pp.
         169-170). The Secret Twelve also donated funds for the
         purchase of a jacket for the Jackson P. Burley High School
         football team (April 28, 1953, p. 151--a blacks- only
         school).</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This ledger is of "The Secret Twelve Club," an all-male
         African-American social club in Charlottesville, Virginia,
         1935, 1949-1955. 
         <emph render="super">1</emph>Most of its entries were made
         between January 10, 1950 and February 22, 1955; these consist
         of minutes, membership lists, attendance rolls, dues and
         assessments, "Rules &amp; Regulations," applications of
         potential members, initiation rituals, and donations of funds
         to various individuals and organizations. According to some
         members, the club was discontinued ca. 1991 but plans are
         underway to revive it; others maintain it is still active. 
         <emph render="super">2</emph></p>
      <p>The inside front cover bears the notation "Secret Twelve
         Club Jan 1950"; missing or blank pages include: 1-24, 28-34,
         36-38, 66, 89-90, 98, 104, 112, 114, 116, 144, 148. (The
         outside cover bears a partially effaced inscription: "Phi
         Kappa Psi Fraternity, Virginia Alpha [Chapter].") 
         <emph render="super">3</emph>Entries are in pencil and ink and
         begin with a copy of the club's "enatations" [enactions?] as
         of December 5, 1935 (p. 25), consisting of initiation
         questions put to each candidate prior to admission to
         membership, followed by "Rules and Regulations" (p. 27) and
         "By Laws" (p. 35). The first meeting described in this volume
         (January 10, 1950, p. 39-41), mentions election of officers,
         payment of dues, and motions; subsequent entries report the
         suspension of members for nonpayment of dues, absence at
         meetings or failing to allow their homes to be meeting sites
         even though it was the member's turn (January 23, 1950),
         resignations (W. J. Lewis, June 27, 1950), and club funds are
         accounted for and balanced.</p>
