      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a two page letter, January 17,
         1888, from Jesse, a resident of the Virginia Confederate
         Soldiers' Home [National Home for Disabled Volunteer
         Soldiers], Southern Branch, to his cousin Julia, in which he
         complains about the uncongenial surroundings of the home due
         to the ready accessibility of beer in a saloon on grounds, the
         profits of which go to support the theater and band, which
         causes quarrels and constant excitement among the residents
         who indulge. Other complaints include the all day card playing
         of the residents, also accompanied by profanity and quarrels,
         and the crowded and poorly ventilated bedrooms.</p>
      <p>To pass the time, Jesse visits the institution next door,
         the "Normal and Industrial School for the Instruction of
         Negroes &amp; Indians" [Hampton Normal &amp; Agricultural
         Institute ?] for elementary education and various trades. The
         trades he mentions include: blacksmithing, wheel wright,
         carpentry, cabinet making, shoe making, harness making, tin
         smithing, printing, book binding, farming, and a large
         sawmill. The school also has an excellent library and reading
         room with the best magazines and newspapers, where he spends
         most of his time.</p>
      <p>Jesse encloses a list of quotations whose authors he has
         been unable to find for a contest and asks if she knows any of
         them. He also writes that he hopes to visit Oscar and Uncle
         Charles' children in Kansas next spring or summer after paying
         her a visit in April.</p>
