         <p>The Randolph family, one of the earliest and most important families to settle in Virginia in 1673 were landowners, lawyers, congressman, and several held high office in the state of Virginia and the United
States Government. Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United States, was a member of the Randolph family. The Cary, Taylor, Kirk and Dickins' families were relations of the Randolph family.

         <head>Scope and Content
</head>
         <p>This collection contains ca.15 items ca.1866-1967, n.d.,and consists of genealogies of the Randolph [1700-1911], Taylor, Kirk and Dickins' families with some additional information on the Cary Family [1180-
1830]; including a narrative sketch of a man named Augustus (Augustine) Herrman (1605-1686). There are also some handwritten biographical notes about Thomas Jefferson; his father, Peter Jefferson; a contemporary
of his father's , William Byrd and a former congressman, William Nelson.
</p>
         <p>In addition to the genealogies, there is a miscellaneous household inventory list with a note outlining certain tasks of an estate administration such as: a burial; and collection and payment of debts. There is
also a transcription of tombstone inscriptions for the Randolph family.
</p>
         <p>There are two medals in this collection. One is a University of Virginia Medal given to Stevens Mason Taylor (great-great grandson of Thomas Jefferson) because he was a student at the University and fought in
the Civil War. The other was awarded to Edwin Kirk (husband of Page Taylor) for meritorious service by the Department of the Interior on December 31, 1954.
