         <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
         <p>Luther P. Jackson was born July 11, 1892, in Lexington,
         Kentucky, one of 12 children of a dairyman, Edward, and a
         schoolteacher, Delilah. He earned his bachelor of arts degree
         at Fisk University in 1914 and a master of arts degree at
         Columbia University in 1917. He taught at colleges in South
         Carolina and Kansas, and in 1922 joined the faculty at
         Virginia State College (now University) and eventually became
         a full professor and chairman of its history department.
         During that same year he married Johnnella Frazer, a native of
         Shelbyville, Kentucky, and they ultimately had four children:
         Luther, Jr., Edward, John, and Laura.</p>
         <p>Long before receiving his doctorate from the University of
         Chicago in 1949, Dr. Jackson had dedicated his life to the
         research and writing of African-American history and the
         securing of civil rights for blacks, especially the right to
         vote. He published numerous articles and specialized in the
         history of blacks in Virginia; his major monographs were Free
         Negro Labor and Property Holding in Virginia, 1830-1860
         (1942), Virginia Negro Soldiers and Sailors In The
         Revolutionary War (1944) and, Negro Office-Holders in Virginia
         1865-1895 (1945).</p>
         <p>Jackson was widely respected as an historian and crusader
         for civic freedom. James H. Brewer, another African-American
         historian who taught at Virginia State, wrote an acclamatory
         preface for the 1969 reprint of Jackson's Free Negro Labor:
         "In this book, my former history professor is content to be a
         scholar. His style is simple, and his tone is measured. He has
         presented the facts as they are, believing that facts properly
         set forth will speak for themselves."</p>
         <p>Jackson chaired the Virginia chapter of the Association for
         the Study of Negro Life and History (now the Association for
         the Study of Afro-American Life and History); was an editor of
         The Journal of Negro History; secretary of the all-black State
         Teacher's Association; a founder of the Petersburg Negro
         Business Association; founder of the Virginia Voters League;
         wrote a weekly column in the Norfolk Journal and Guide; and
         published annual reports the voting status of black Virginians
         from 1941 until his death. This community activist and
         historian died on April 13, 1950. His funeral was held at
         Virginia State College. At the time of his death he was
         editing a manuscript later published as Memoirs of A
         Monticello Slave, the reminiscences of Isaac Jefferson, a
         slave of Thomas Jefferson.</p>
         <p>In October 1977, the University of Virginia dedicated the
         Luther P. Jackson House (#4 Dawson's Row) as the home for its
         Office of Afro-American Affairs (OAAA), the first university
         building named in honor of a black Virginian. His son, Luther
         P. Jackson, Jr., a professor of journalism at Columbia
         University, was the guest speaker. As part of ceremonies of
         the tenth anniversary of its founding, the Jackson House was
         rededicated in October 1987 after renovations the previous
         summer. The keynote speaker was Dr. Harold K. Braxton, Dean of
         the School of Humanities and Social Sciences and Coordinator
         of Religious Studies at Virginia State University and a
         University of Virginia alumnus.</p>
