      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p><persname normal="Arthur Fickenscher">Arthur
         Fickénscher</persname>, composer, pianist, teacher
         and inventor, was born to George W. and Elizabeth Wagner
         Fickénscher on March 9, 1871, in Aurora, Illinois.
         His musical education began at an early age; learning violin
         and piano under the tutelage and guidance of his music
         instructor father, he gave his first recital at age six. He
         spent his later formative years (1883-1889) as a student in
         Munich, Germany attending the 
         <emph render="italic">Hochschule der Musik</emph>and the Royal
         Academy from which he graduated with unprecedented honors
         after studying under such notables in music theory and
         composition as Joseph Rheinberger and Ludwig Thuille. Upon
         returning to Illinois, Fickénscher taught piano
         privately to students and gave formal concert performances
         around the Chicago area. His reputation as an accomplished
         pianist and accompanist led to his participation in concert
         tours throughout the United States and Mexico with many of the
         distinguished singers of the day such as the great Wagnerian
         tenor, Anton Shott; Nikita, soprano of the Russian opera;
         Materna; David Bispham and Madame Shumann-Heink. These tours
         enhanced his reputation and allowed his piano mastery and
         musical artistry wide recognition.</p>
      <p>In 1896, Fickénscher settled in San Francisco
         where he taught and coached young singers and studied the
         potentialities of the human voice. He also began to immerse
         himself in the composition of original music, being
         particularly drawn by the influence of the English poets of
         the Renaissance, Dante Rossetti and William Morris. In 1901,
         he married 
         <persname>Edith Cruzan</persname>, an opera and concert singer
         whose theatrical and musical talents matched his own as they
         became an acclaimed recital team throughout the west coast.
         While living in San Francisco, the Fickénschers
         experienced the great earthquake of 1906. In the fire that
         devastated the city, they lost their home and many of their
         possessions including papers, press clippings, memorabilia and
         compositional manuscripts relating to their concert activities
         and Fickénscher's early music works.</p>
      <p>In 1911, Fickénscher returned to Germany with
         his wife and young daughter, 
         <persname normal="Arditha Fickenscher">Arditha</persname>. He
         established a studio in Berlin providing vocal instruction to
         students and undertook a series of joint recitals with his
         wife that introduced them to admiring European audiences. In
         that period, his choral-orchestral poem, 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">The Chamber Blue</title></bibref>and the orchestral-choral symphonic poem, 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Aucassin and Nicolete</title></bibref>were performed to positive reviews in concert
         presentations. Fickénscher also continued to pursue
         his idea of perfecting a keyboard for pure intonation and was
         granted a patent for its design in Germany in 1912.</p>
      <p>At the outbreak of World War I, the Fickénschers
         returned to California. They opened a studio in both Oakland
         and in San Francisco to instruct and train singers, resumed
         their joint recital programs and lectures and soon became a
         couple in great demand in the music circles in the area and
         beyond. That demand induced them in 1917 to move to New York
         City, to again teach students and to present themselves in
         recital and concert programs to metropolitan music lovers.</p>
      <p>A major change in Fickénscher's career style
         took place three years later. In 1920 he accepted an
         invitation from Edwin A. Alderman, then president of the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>in Charlottesville,
         to serve as head of the newly established music department.
         Over the next 14 years he devoted himself in quiet dignity,
         but tireless energy to the challenge of organizing, developing
         and directing the administration of the department. He taught
         students; gave leadership to the 
         <corpname>University Glee Club</corpname>and presented major
         concerts in Washington, Baltimore, New Orleans, Richmond and
         numerous other cities and towns throughout Virginia. He
         established the 
         <corpname>Albemarle Choral Club</corpname>; conducted the
         University of Virginia and the 
         <corpname>Norfolk Symphony</corpname>orchestras; participated
         in ensemble recitals, every 2 weeks over a period of 11 years
         and, in 1938, conducted a fully staged mimo-drama of his work,
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">The Chamber Blue</title></bibref>at the University. He performed organ recitals in the
         University's McIntire Amphitheater; provided piano
         accompaniment to students in vocal programs and instituted the
         <corpname>McIntire Concerts</corpname>program which featured
         such renowned artists as, Barrère, Alda, Novaes,
         Homer, Casals, Ponselle, Martinelli and Zimbalist. With all
         this, he still found time to arrange the settings of numerous
         college football songs; to serve as the regular organist at 
         <corpname>Christ Episcopal Church</corpname>in Charlottesville
         and to continue work on his music compositions and on the
         development and construction of the "Polytone," his idea of a
         workable intonation keyboard which he designed to subdivide
         the octave into 60 tones.</p>
      <p>In 1941, Fickénscher retired from the University
         of Virginia and returned to Fairfax in Marin County in
         California. There he worked to complete his major unfinished
         orchestral-choral symphonic poem, 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">The Land East of the Sun</title></bibref>and to publish an article on the Polytone which he
         had patented in February 1941. The article, "The Polytone and
         the Potentialities of a Purer Intonation," appeared in 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">The Music Quarterly</title></bibref>(July, 1941). In May, 1946, he participated in
         concert at Florida State Teacher's College, conducting 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">The Chamber Blue</title></bibref>with the Australian-American composer, Percy Grainger
         at the piano and, as pianist, joining a string quartet to play
         the 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Piano Quintet</title></bibref>.</p>
      <p>In 1947, the Fickénschers relocated to the city
         of San Francisco to spend their remaining years near their
         daughter. Edith Fickénscher died on January 9, 1950
         and Arthur Fickénscher on April, 15, 1954. Some
         years later, in 1983, their ashes were spread over the grounds
         of the University of Virginia cemetery near the grave of their
         close friends, James Southall Wilson and his wife Julia by two
         devoted former students and lifelong friends and associates,
         Robert Septimus Pace, Jr. and William W. Jones.</p>
      <p>As a composer, Arthur Fickénscher was influenced
         by Bach, Wagner and César Franck. His work
         reflected contemporary trends and was cast in a "sensuous
         mysticism" that intrigued many of his musical colleagues,
         particularly Percy Grainger (1882-1961) who considered
         Fickénscher to be one of the few musical geniuses
         of the 20th century.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Papers of Arthur Fickénscher contain ca.
         2,000 items (11 shelf feet) that span the years 1895-1995. The
         largest portion of the papers, consists of originals and
         copies of virtually all of the music that
         Fickénscher produced. The remaining portion
         contains correspondence and other papers of a professional and
         personal nature. The collection has been divided into three
         major groups:</p>
      <p>Group I, (Correspondence), contains letters sent to
         Fickénscher and drafts and second copies of letters
         that he prepared. The correspondence is subdivided into three
         categories: (1) General, (2) Named and (3) Polytone Related.
         These are listed by date or by correspondent name to highlight
         special interest or subject matter.</p>
      <p>Group II, (Professional and Personal), contains items
         relating to Fickénscher's music and academic career
         activities. These include published articles; biographical
         background about his life and work; catalogue descriptions of
         his music; memorabilia in the form of concert and recital
         programs; reviews and newspaper clippings; a compilation of
         notes, drawings and music relating to the evolution and
         development of the "Polytone;" and an assortment of other
         miscellaneous items consisting of financial and contract
         records of the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia's McIntire
         Concerts</corpname>(1919-1939); photographs of family and
         friends; instructor notes for voice lessons; some brochures
         about musical instruments; name and address notebooks and
         family birth, marriage and burial documents.</p>
      <p>Group III, (Compositions), contains original manuscripts,
         master sheets for duplication and print copies of musical
         scores. These items have been consolidated into oversized
         folders for ease of reference and study and have been arranged
         in this listing under descriptive categories similar to those
         used by Fickénscher in describing his own
         compositions and by others who have catalogued his musical
         works. (see William W. Jones and Gordon Rumson (Box 1, below)
         and also William W. Jones,

         been transferred to the appropriate custodial section of the

         is identified as part of these papers.</p>
