      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>There are ten items, 1859-1893, chiefly pertaining to 
          John Bowdoin Cocke (1836-1889), eldest son
         of 
          Philip St. George Cocke, and "Belmead," Powhatan County, Virginia, the 
          Cocke family home. There are electrostatic
         copies of four documents relating to Cocke. Among these are
         two military documents: a Commission for Major in the First
         Regiment of Cavalry of the 4th Brigade and First Division of
         the 
          Virginia Militia, signed by 
          Henry A. Wise, August 1, 1859; and, a
         Commission for First Lieutenant in the Provisional Army of the
         State of 
          Virginia, May 24, 1861. Other documents
         include a Pardon and Amnesty, July 6, 1865, given by President
          Andrew Johnson to Cocke for his part in
         the rebellion against the government of the 
          United States ; and, a summons sent to the
         Sheriff of 
          Fluvanna County for various parties,
         including 
          John Bowdoin Cocke and other members of
         the 
          Cocke family , to appear at the Circuit
         Court in 
          Henrico County on November 28, 1874, to
         answer a bill in Chancery exhibited against them by 
          Robert Bright and 
          Matilda Southall . Also included is an
         inventory, January 1860, of lands belonging to the 
          Philip St. George Cocke family, "Beldale" Plantation, 
          Powhatan County, Virginia, and "Silver Creek" Plantation, 
          Yazoo County, Mississippi, including
         lists of slaves. In addition, there are five items, 1874-1893,
         pertaining to "Belmead." A copy of a letter, January 9,
         1874, from 
          Samuel M. Wilson to 
          John Bowdoin Cocke, concerns the
         settlement of the Estate in 
          Powhatan County [presumably "Belmead"]. On April 16, 1886, 
          Charles Hartwell Cocke, 
          Columbus, Mississippi, writes to his
         brother, 
          John Bowdoin Cocke at "Belmead," an understanding and
         sympathetic letter concerning the impending loss of their
         family home and expressing hopes for a liberal purchaser.
         Other items pertaining to "Belmead" include a list of books
         belonging to John Bowdoin Cocke, sold by his wife, Bettie Burwell (Page) Cocke (1841-1900) in 1893; notes on the financial status of "Belmead," with information on the deed
         of trust; and, a newspaper clipping, 1893, concerning the sale
         of the estate.</p>
