         <p>Walter Besant (1836-1901) was an instructor in mathematics
         and a senior professor at the Royal College, Mauritius, before
         he began his literary career with the publication of 
         <title render="italic">Studies in Early French Poetry</title>.
         He was also secretary of the Palestine Exploration Fund which
         resulted in his collaboration with Professor E.H. Palmer on 
         <title render="italic">Jerusalem: The City of Herod and
         Saladin</title>. He began his work as a novelist with his
         collaboration with the editor of 
         <title render="italic">Once a Week</title>, James Rice, and
         continued writing historical novels on his own when the
         illness of Rice ended the partnership.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This literary collection consists of letters, notes, and a
         telegram, ca. 70 items, 1888-1932, and undated, of the English
         author, Walter Besant (1836-1901) and his literary agent A.P.
         Watt concerning publication arrangements for Besant's
         work.</p>
         <p>Three letters from P.M. Besant to A.P. Watt illustrate his
         role as manager of Besant's books, such as the request of
         Macmillian to publish 
         <title render="italic">Life of Captain Cook</title>in 1932,
         after his uncle's death.</p>

            <emph render="bold">LETTERS FROM WALTER BESANT TO A.P.
         WATT</emph>
            <lb/>
            <lb/>There are fourteen letters from Besant to his agent,
         A.P. Watt, 1888-1901, discussing various offers from
         publishers concerning his work. In two letters to Watt,
         January 12 &amp; 14, 1888, Besant discusses his agreement to
         do an article about the writing of novels for 
         <title render="italic">Atalanta</title>and insists that Watt
         get a written acknowledgement from the magazine that they had
         only purchased serial rights to the article for "I mistrust
         the publisher" (see letters from publishers, 1888 Jan 10, 16
         &amp; 20). In another letter, March 25, 1889, Besant furnishes
         a list of stories, calculations as to the number of words in
         each, with its date of publication, and a possible arrangement
         for publication, "The first volume will make as much as a very
         long two volume novel. The second one rather shorter but still
         a good length. One or two pictures might be chosen from 
         <title render="italic">Harper</title>and 
         <title render="italic">The Illustrated London News</title>for
         frontespieces, etc. I am quite in your hand regards
         price."</p>
         <p>Besant also urges Watt, "Let us take Chatto's offer...[for
         Dorothy Foster] the best written of the whole set" (1889 Nov
         30); sends Watt a permission request, "Here is a little
         document of no apparent importance - permission to make an
         opera out of 
         <title render="italic">The Inner House</title>to a country
         musician - will you kindly place it with your papers?" (1892
         Feb 15); sends an introduction for 
         <title render="italic">The Charm and Other Drawing-Room
         Plays</title>and mentions his collaborator on the plays, W.H.
         Pollock, who authorized Besant to act on his behalf concerning
         the book (1895 Oct 17); agrees in his negotiations with the
         editor of 
         <title render="italic">Lady's Pictorial</title>for a 120,000
         word story in serial form set in the eighteenth century in
         which the editor may eliminate any "words he may think
         objectionable" since the story was for a woman's publication
         (1898 Feb 10; see also letters from publishers, 1898 Feb);
         Besant responds to an offer to take up writing for "The
         Century of Empire" formerly written by Sir Herbert Maxwell and
         the Marquis of Lorne, in which he proposes "to carry on the
         thing on much the same lines as the two previous writers with
         less politics and more sociology" (1900 May 6); and mentions
         his health, "I am not much better but am no worse. The nausea
         still continues" (1901 April 19).</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">LETTERS FROM PUBLISHERS TO A.P.
         WATT</emph>
            <lb/>
            <lb/>All of this correspondence pertains to the purchase of
         publication rights for the stories and novels of Walter
         Besant, usually in a serial format, by various publishers and
         magazines including the 
         <title render="italic">Dicky Bird Society Weekly
         Chronicle</title>, The 
         <title render="italic">Liverpool Daily Post</title>, 
         <title render="italic">The Weekly Scotsman</title>, 
         <title render="italic">Atalanta</title>, 
         <title render="italic">The Illustrated London News</title>, 
         <title render="italic">Yorkshire Post</title>, 
         <title render="italic">The Graphic</title>, 
         <title render="italic">Lady's Pictorial</title>, 
         <title render="italic">Cassell's Magazine</title>, 
         <title render="italic">The Ipswich Journal</title>, 
         <title render="italic">Pall Mall Magazine</title>, 
         <title render="italic">The Birmingham Daily Post</title>, and 
         <title render="italic">The Courier</title>.</p>
         <p>In price negotiations with William H. Hatton of The Midland
         Press, Limited, Watt compared Hatton's offer for Besant's
         story with the price paid Wilkie Collins for a similiar work,
         to which the publisher replied, "There was a special reason
         for giving 35 pounds for Wilkie Collins - he is still a great
         favorite here. Amongst the mass of readers Mr. Besant is
         comparatively unknown and therefore we considered that our
         regular rate - 25 pounds - should not be overstepped" (1888
         Oct 10, 12, &amp; 15).</p>
         <p>There are several letters concerning the offer of 
         <title render="italic">The Graphic</title>for publishing
         rights to "a story of the ordinary three volume length" from
         Besant if Watt would try to sell for them the right to publish
         the story in provincial newspapers (1889 Mar 21 &amp; 26; Apr
         5; Jul 2 &amp; 4; Aug 9, 17, &amp; 23; Oct 31; and Nov
         12).</p>
         <p>Andrew Chatto writes to Watt concerning the publication of
         a new collection of Besant's unpublished short stories (1889
         Mar 28); Chatto and Windus makes an offer for the stereos,
         illustrations, remaining stock and copyright of 
         <title render="italic">Jerusalem: The City of Herod and
         Saladin</title>if Besant would supply an appendix or
         introduction for a new edition of the work discussing the
         results of the most recent investigations and explorations of
         the Palestine Exploration Committee (1899 Feb 1); and Chatto
         and Windus seek the serial rights to 
         <title render="italic">The Lady of Lynn</title>and 
         <title render="italic">The Way Out</title>(1901 Jul 30).</p>
         <p>Other topics include: the competition between Besant and
         Sir Henry Rider Haggard for publication in serial form (1889
         Aug 23 &amp; Nov 12); the serial rights to 
         <title render="italic">Armorel of Lyonesse</title>in 
         <title render="italic">The Penny Illustrated
         Paper</title>(1890 Feb 21 &amp; 26); disagreement between the
         representative of the John Jacob Astor Estate and Watt over
         securing American copyright for Besant's work (1896 Jan 4);
         Richard Bentley discussing the transfer of publication rights
         for 
         <title render="italic">The French Humorists</title>and 
         <title render="italic">The History of Jerusalem</title>to
         Macmillan &amp; Co. (1898 Sep 28 &amp; Nov 18); arrangements
         by 
         <title render="italic">Cassall's Magazine</title>to secure
         Besant's "Christmas in Old Westminister" (1900 May 25 and 1901
         Apr 2 &amp; 13); discussion concerning corrections for 
         <title render="italic">The Charm and Other Drawing-Room
         Plays</title>(1895 Oct 17); negotiations with Dodd, Mead over
         the publication of 
         <title render="italic">The Autobiography of Sir Walter
         Besant</title>(1901 Jun 23 &amp; 27, and Jul 27);
         correspondence with Macmillan concerning the copyright for 
         <title render="italic">Life of Captain Cook</title>(1932 Jan 8
         &amp; 14); and several pages of notes concerning 
         <title render="italic">Survey of London</title>(n.d.).</p>
