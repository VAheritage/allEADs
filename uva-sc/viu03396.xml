        <p>These papers are an addition to the main collection
            (#5996) given by Henry and Elizabeth Higginbotton in 1959
            and 1971. The main collection is one that was utilized for
            the biography by Gary Hess. This collection contains the
            richest material and most extensive records. This current
            gift was presented to the University of Virginia in these
            groups from Dec. 1971 - May 1972 by Mrs. Lynndon Clough and
            David Higginbottom. Accession number #5996-b came from the
            estate of Gertrude Higginbotton Wallace of Washington, D.C.
            Accession numbers #5996-c and #5996-d came from the
            Higginbottom home in Florida. Material that was judged
            irrelevant to Higginbottom's missionary activities was
            returned to the Higginbottom family.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Higginbottom Papers, 1844-1971, consist of ca. 13,650
         items (ca. 13 shelf feet) relating to activities of the
         Higginbottom family. The collection contains family
         correspondence and papers pertaining to missionary activities,
         the Presbyterian Church, and miscellaneous activities of the
         Higginbottoms. There are some manuscript drafts, proofs, etc.,
         of various published works and reports by Ethel and Sam
         Higginbottom.</p>
      <p>To 1903 the papers chiefly include family correspondence
         providing interesting background for understanding the
         missionary life that the Higginbottom's led. From 1903 to 1945
         the papers primarily concern Sam and Ethel's activities as
         missionaries in India and the development of the agricultural
         institute at Allahabad. Although this material is peripheral
         to the main collection (See "Acquisition") it offers
         fascinating insight into the personal life and attitudes of
         the Higginbottoms'. Satisfactions and frustrations are
         chronicled through their letters to one another, members of
         the family, and friends. There is also some interesting
         information concerning the relationship between the missionary
         activity and the emergin nationalist sentiment in India.
         Higginbottom's activities in fund-raising durign his visits to
         the United States are thoroughly covered, as are Ethel's
         activities in the States. The post-1945 material pertains to
         the activities of Sam and Ethel durign their retirement. These
         papers reflect their continuing attachment to Indian
         missionary work. They also document the efforts of Sam
         Higginbottom to found the Christian Service Training Center at
         Frostproof, Florida during the 1950s.</p>
      <p>Sam Higginbotton (1874-1958) came to American from England
         in 1894 to attend the Mt. Harmon School in Massachusetts.
         Influenced by the evangelical work of Dwight Lyman Moody, he
         went to Amherst in 1899 and Princeton in 1901. While at
         Princeton, he met George Forman, a missionary from India.
         Forman convinced Higginbotton to go to India as a Presbyterian
         missionary in 1903. Higginbotton taught at the Allahabad
         Christian College and was deeply impressed by the poverty of
         village life. He assumed a leading role in developing the
         Naini Leper Asylum and conceived the pioneering idea of
         founding an agricultural school to improve economic conditions
         on the sub-continent. Ethel and Sam Higginbottom returned to
         America several times to raise funds for the Allahabad
         Agricultual Institute. Such visits occurred during 1909-11,
         1914-15, 1919-21, 1932-33. The period of greatest development
         and fufillment for the school was during the 1920s and 1930s.
         Such prominent Indians such as Gandhi were fascinated by
         Higginbottom's ideas for the improvement of Indian life.
         During various periods Higginbottom advised Indian princes
         concerning agricultural techniques. Throughout his stay in
         India, Higginbottom remained in close contact with his
         associates in the Presbyterian Church. His manifold public
         appearances in search of funds brought them increasing
         recognition from leaders of the Church. In 1939 Higginbottom
         was elected Moderator of the Presbyterian Chruch in
         America.</p>
      <p>Higginbottom retired in 1945 and returned to America
         settling in Frostproof, Florida. Higginbottom kept in close
         touch with developments in India until his death. During the
         1950s he unsuccessfully tried to establish a Christian Service
         Training Center to train missionaries for agricultural work.
         During his lifetime Higginbottom was widely known and
         respected. His biographer has written that he "embodied the
         ideal American representative in underdeveloped nations." His
         life and the work of the Institute have been adequately
         delineated by Gary R. Hess in

      <p>When the material was received it was in no inherent order,
         either chronologically or topically. Series I, Accission
         #5996-b, was kept apart from #5996-c and #5996-d (Series II),
         which were interfiled, and two chronologies were created.
         However the chronological breakdown does not extend to month
         and day. The arrangement within the chronology is generally:
         family papers, missionary papers, Presbyterian Church papers,
         and general and miscellaneous papers.</p>
