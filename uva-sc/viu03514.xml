      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The son of Daniel Mason Hutchinson and Theresa (Jones)
         Hutchinson, Martin Ashtin Hutchinson was born in Newport,
         Giles County, Virginia, on September 13, 1892. Raised on a
         farm, he attended public schools, and in 1914 he studied at
         Roanoke National Business College. From 1915-1919 he worked in
         a law office in Pearisburg and was Deputy Treasurer of Giles
         County. He served in the army for a seven month period in 1918
         and in that same year married Mary Estelle Givens of Craig
         County by whom he had one daughter, Madge. Hutchinson had
         helped E. Lee Trinkle in his campaign for the state senate,
         and Trinkle, later governor, got him a job as journal clerk of
         the Senate. Hutchinson served in this post from 1920 to 1923.
         He then served as chief clerk to the secretary of the
         Commonwealth, 1925-1927. He studied law at night for two years
         and was admitted to the Virginia Bar on 20 December 1927.</p>
      <p>In 1927, Governor Harry F. Byrd appointed him secretary of
         the Commonwealth; however, Byrd later decided to abolish this
         office and merge the duties with those of the governor's
         secretary. Hutchinson opposed this move, not only because he
         would lose his post, but also because he believed Byrd's plan
         was undemocratic. Byrd did in fact abolish the job in 1930.
         Hutchinson devoted himself to the practice of law, mainly tax
         and corporate cases, in the Richmond firm of Kirsch and Bazile
         from this time until his death in 1962. He continued to be
         heavily involved in politics, as he served as secretary of the
         Democratic State Central Committee from 1925-1939. He became a
         staunch backer of the progressive governor James Price, and
         held the post of chairman of the State Compensation Board in
         Price's administration from 1939-1942. During World War II he
         was United States Government Appeal Agent, Richmond Local
         [Draft] Board No. 6.</p>
      <p>Through his career, Hutchinson consistently supported the
         Democratic party on the national level and worked hard for all
         of the presidential candidates. He greatly admired Franklin D.
         Roosevelt and criticized Byrd and Carter Glass for their
         opposition to the New Deal. By the mid-forties, Hutchinson had
         emerged as one of the leading Democratic liberals who opposed
         the Byrd "organization" and advocated improved social services
         and education. In 1946, he challenged Senator Byrd in the
         Democratic primary. His campaign was handicapped by a lack of
         money and manpower, however, and he received only 31.6% of the
         vote. In the wake of his defeat, he and other liberal leaders
         organized the Committee for Democracy in Virginia to discuss
         and articulate their political principles.</p>
      <p>In 1948 Hutchinson managed and directed the campaign of the
         Truman-Barkley Straight Ticket Committee, which was believed
         to have significantly contributed to the Truman victory in
         Virginia and to have strengthened the liberal cause.
         Hutchinson actively assisted his friend Francis Pickens Miller
         in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1949 and the
         senatorial primary of 1952; Miller was defeated on both
         occasions. In 1950, President Truman nominated Hutchinson for
         the position of Federal Trade Commissioner, but the nomination
         was blocked by Senator Byrd for political reasons. By 1954,
         Hutchinson was suffering from impaired vision and was unable
         to actively participate in politics during the latter part of
         his life.</p>
      <p>Hutchinson was a member of the Richmond City and American
         Bar Association, the Scottish Rite Masons of Richmond, and the
         Virginia Historical Society. He belonged to Centenary
         Methodist Church where he taught Sunday School. He died of a
         heart attack on November 27, 1962.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Martin Ashton Hutchinson collection, ca. 25,000 items
         (21.7 shelf feet), consists of correspondence, papers and
         newspaper clippings documenting the political and legal career
         of this prominent Virginia Democrat, 1923-1962. The principal
         subject of the correspondence is Democratic party politics,
         and its theme is Hutchinson's gradual shift from alliance with
         Harry F. Byrd to leadership of the liberal anti-Byrd faction.
         The Hutchinson papers would be useful to students of twentieth
         century Virginia politics and invaluable to those interested
         in the development of the liberal wing of the state Democratic
         party. This collection complements the Byrd, Miller, and
         Whitehead papers in the Manuscripts Department.</p>
      <p>In his capacity as state government official, secretary of
         the Democratic State Central Committee, and party faithful,
         Hutchinson corresponded with Democratic leaders such as J. M.
         Hooker, John W. Flannigan, James P. Hart, P. H. Drewry, E. Lee
         Trinkle, James H. Price, G. Walter Mapp, E. R. Combs, Leonard
         G. Muse, Claude Pepper, Colgate Darden, and others. The
         subjects include political strategy, primary and general
         election campaigns, fund-raising, patronage, and state issues.
         There are many letters to Hutchinson from persons seeking
         jobs. Hutchinson corresponded with national Democratic party
         leaders such as James A. Farley and J. Howard McGrath
         concerning various presidential campaigns.</p>
      <p>In the mid-1930's, Hutchinson expressed his strong support
         for Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal and in 1945 began
         to correspond primarily with liberal Democrats who opposed the
         Byrd organization such as Lloyd M. Robinette, Francis Pickens
         Miller, Moss Plunkett, Robert Whitehead, and Joseph H.
         Harrison. There is a great deal of correspondence relating to
         Hutchinson's unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination
         for senator in 1946, Miller's two unsuccessful primary races,
         and the formation of the liberal "Committee for Democracy in
         Virginia" in 1947. Hutchinson corresponded with President
         Harry S. Truman, his Administrative Assistant Donald S.
         Dawson, Assistant Attorney General H. Graham Morison, and
         Senator Paul Douglas concerning his nomination for Federal
         Trade Commissioner in 1949-1950. There is a little
         correspondence with J. Lindsay Almond as well. Hutchinson
         frequently wrote to newspapermen Virginius Dabney, James J.
         Kilpatrick, and Drew Pearson, discussing political
         subjects.</p>
      <p>The collection includes correspondence pertaining to
         Hutchinson's law practice, heaviest from 1942-1945, when his
         political activity was at a relatively low ebb. The only
         significant family correspondence in the collection is between
         Hutchinson and his brother Curry P. Hutchinson. These letters
         discuss not only family matters, but also national, state, and
         local politics as Curry was extremely active in the Democratic
         Party in southwest Virginia. Hutchinson also corresponded with
         his parents Daniel Mason Hutchinson and Theresa (Jones)
         Hutchinson, his daughter Madge (Mrs. Franklin Marsh), his
         brother John, and his sister Gertrude. Several folders
         concerning Hutchinson's participation in Centenary Methodist
         Church, 1955-1962, complete the correspondence.</p>
      <p>In addition to the letters, there are political papers such
         as speeches, pamphlets, press releases, reports, and campaign
         account records, and a few business papers. There are also a
         number of miscellaneous papers such as Sunday School lessons
         and inspirational quotations. The collection includes many
         newspaper clippings, mainly relating to politics, and one
         photograph of Senator Thomas S. Martin. There are seven
         phonograph recordings of speeches by Hutchinson in his 1946
         campaign. Legal case files from Hutchinson's office round out
         the collection.</p>

      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>The collection arrived at the library in rough
         chronological order, and this organization has been retained.

         groups: Political and Business Correspondence; Political and
         Business Papers, Miscellaneous Papers; Newspaper Clippings;
         and Legal Case Files. The political, business and family
         correspondence has all been interfiled and is followed by
         several folders of correspondence concerning Centenary
         Methodist Church. The Miscellaneous Papers include the Sunday
         School lessons and inspirational quotations. All of the
         material in each of the categories has been arranged
         chronologically.</p>
