      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Douglas Southall Freeman was born in Lynchburg, Virginia,
         on May 16, 1886. He graduated from the University of Richmond
         with the degree of A.B. and received his Ph.D. in history from
         the Johns Hopkins University in 1908. He was editor of the
         Richmond 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">News Leader</title>from 1915 to 1949.
         Dr. Freeman pursued his interest in history in the writing of
         several books, among them: 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Lee's Lieutenants</title>; 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">R.E. Lee, A Biography</title>; and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">George Washington.</title>He was
         awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the latter two. In addition to
         his duties on the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">News Leader</title>he became one of
         radio's first analysts in 1925. He commuted weekly by air to
         New York City to teach journalism at Columbia University
         (1934-1941), and was a lecturer at the Army War College for
         seven years. On his retirement on June 25, 1949, an article in
         the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">News Leader</title>stated: "Dr.
         Freeman's editorial specialties were taxation, municipal
         government, military development and operations, and
         observations of nature." After his death on June 13, 1953 his
         obituary in the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">News Leader</title>included the
         following: "He must have written close to 600,000 words a
         year, campaigned for the Federal Reserve Act, for abolition of
         the old City Administration Board, for repeal of the fee
         system, for establishment of the battlefield parks, for
         Richmond's new charter...Among the legacies he left to us here
         on the paper were his 'Seventy Rules for Good Writing'...he
         put brevity just behind accuracy in his list of virtues."</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Douglas Southall Freeman collection comprises Freeman's
         editorial research files from his career as editor of the
         Richmond 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">News Leader</title>. The bulk of this
         material dates from 1900-1955 with several original items
         dated between 1819 and 1882. Transcripts of nineteenth-century
         material are also included. Approximately one-fifth of the
         foldres include material originating after Dr. Freeman's
         retirement. It appears that additions were made to these files
         under the direction of James J. Kilpatrick, Dr. Freeman's
         successor.</p>
      <p>Because Dr. Freeman was a journalist and a historian, his
         source material includes a large numer of subjects covering a
         broad range of historical and current interests, which
         interests included taxation and finances, Civil War history,
         World Wars I and II, and municipal government. The collection
         includes circular letters, clippings, correspondence, United
         States government documents, memoranda, newsletters,
         newspapers, pamphlets, press releases, reports, and speeches.
         Distributed throughout the collection are some of Dr.
         Freeman's notes, typed manuscripts, and letters.</p>
      <p>Many of the folders are headed with the names of people and
         contain either information about these people or their letters
         or articles. The people mentioned include local, national, or
         international figures cocerned with military, politics, law,
         science, education and industry. These folders cover such
         topics as the alleged treason of Jefferson Davis and Dr.
         Freeman's retirement, and contain such varied items as a
         letter written by John S. Mosby in 1902, an address by
         Alexander Stephens before the General Assembly of Georgia in
         1866, a sketch of J.E.B. Stuart by Dr. Freeman, and James
         Branch Cabell's typescript essay on Thackeray's "Colonel
         Esmond." Under "Schiebert, Major I" can be found a manuscript
         entitled "Sherman's March Through Georgia," dictated by
         Schiebert in collaboration with Lieutenant Colonel Charles S.
         Venable, aide-de-camp to General Robert E. Lee. Filed under
         "Lee, R.E.; Farewell Order No. 9" is a letter which encloses
         photostatic copies of several documents related to General
         Lee's surrender and an article: "Manuscripts of Lee's Farewell
         to His Army, General Order No. 9." Several folders contain
         biographies most of which were supplied by the British
         Information Services during World War II and concern British
         subjects and military personnel.</p>
      <p>Folders not headed wtih the names of people are concerned
         with topics such as foreign countries, finances, city
         government, wars, peace, and women in public affairs. The
         Commonwealth of Virginia and the City of Richmond receive a
         great deal of attention under such headings as "Civic Survey,"
         which contains letters from the Civil Association of Richmond,
         of which Dr. Freeman was a member. Files on foreign countries
         contain information about World Wars I and II in the
         respective areas or wartime press releases from those
         countries. Other war-related materials include typed
         transcripts of Civil War soldiers' diaries under "Confederate
         Material and Federal Diary"; letters from World War II
         servicemen and a Confederate soldier under "War Letters"; and
         other materials related to World Wars I and II which are
         covered under headings beginning "War...", and such specific
         headings as "William Allen White Committee," under which is
         filed material on the Committee to Defend America by Aiding
         the Allies. Several folders are concerned with peace
         conferences, terms, and treaties, including one labeled,
         "Peace, the Defeat of," which contains sixty of Freeman's
         editorials on the subject.</p>
      <p>Financial information may be found under headings
         concerning budgets, finances, taxes, and tariffs, and
         materials in these folders treat of the fiscal problems of
         cities, states, and the federal government, and include a
         detailed series of Freeman's editorials on tariffs and
         budgets. Files relating to women contain materials on women of
         note in early Virginia, including Pocahontas, and on the
         contributions of women to the United States as a whole. There
         is a series of fity editorials from the Richmond 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">News Leader</title>concerning the
         "Berlin Crisis" in 1948. Under "Williamsburg, Virginia" a
         letter from Colonial Williamsburg, Incorporated, claims for
         that city the erection in 1716 of America's first theater. A
         folder headed "War Chronology" was found to be empty and was
         destroyed.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement>
      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>All folders are filed according to their original
         arrangement, alphabetically by topic, and Dr. Freeman's folder
         hearings have been retained. A few folders were found to be
         out of order and were refiled. There are some apparent
         inconsistencies in the filing entries. For example one may
         find subject matter concerning taxation filed under: "Cities,
         Taxation" and under "Taxation, States." Within the folders
         items are filed in forward chronological order. Charts and
         maps listed at the end of this guide are filed in an oversize
         folder.</p>
