      <p>The American Publishing Company was incorporated in
         Hartford, Connecticut, on April 10, 1865. The company's
         location in Hartford was the center of the subscription book
         industry in the United States, with paper manufacturers,
         printers, and binders right at hand. Elisha Bliss was born in
         1822 in Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1867, at the age of 45,
         he replaced S. S. Scranton as secretary of the American
         Publishing Company until 1870 when he became president. From
         1871-1873, he was secretary again; and, from 1873 until 1880
         he remained president. Bliss began replacing several of the
         older agents with his relatives--in Newark and Trenton--and
         made his son, Francis E. Bliss, treasurer. Elisha Bliss was
         considered a remarkably shrewd and calculating businessman,
         and was accused of having cheated both his authors and his
         customers. Bliss died on September 28, 1880. Francis E. Bliss
         took over the management of the American Publishing Company
         from his father in 1880. This and additional information may
         be found in Mark Twain and Elisha Bliss, by Hamlin Lewis Hill,
         University of Missouri, Columbia, 1964 [PS1331.H46 1964].</p>
