            <p>Frank Loucks Hereford Jr. was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana on July 18, 1923. He
                received a B. A. at the University of Virginia in 1943 and a Ph.D. in Physics at the
                University in 1947. While an undergraduate, he wrote a sports column for the
                University newspaper, <title render="italic">College Topics.</title> He was a
                research scientist in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1945. During the war years
                he worked on research for the Manhattan Project under Dr. Jesse Beams, who called
                him "one of the best all around physicists with whom I have ever been associated."
                He worked for the Bartol Research Foundation at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania
                from 1947 to 1949. He married Ann Lane in 1948 and became an Associate Professor of
                Physics at the University of Virginia in 1949, rising to full professor in 1952, and
                Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1962. He was named the Robert C.
                Taylor Professor of Physics in 1966 and was promoted to Provost of the University,
                the chief academic officer after the President. Also in 1966 he received the Thomas
                Jefferson Award in recognition of his extensive services in teaching, research and
                administration. In 1970 he was Provost and Vice-President, being the first occupant
                of this position. Throughout his career, Mr. Hereford was noted as an able teacher
                and an articulate advocate of improving the quality of education at the University.
                He guided and planned for the growth of the University and formulated plans for the
                admission of women to the College of Arts and Sciences. He was visiting professor at
                the University of St. Andrews, Scotland from 1971 to 1972. He was inaugurated as the
                fifth president of the University of Virginia in 1974. He was the recipient of the
                Raven Award in 1983, the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award in 1985, as well as the IMP
                Society Distinguished Faculty Award in the same year. He was a member of many honor
                societies including Phi Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa, Alpha Tau Omega, Raven
                Society, Sigma XI, and Fellow of American Physical Society. He was on the Board of
                Directors of the Virginia National Bank, Belfield School; St. Anne's School;
                Woodberry Forest School; The Mariners Museum and Gould, Inc. He was the
                author of numerous publications and was an avid sportsman, enjoying hunting and

                with racism against African Americans and Jews at the University of Virginia and
