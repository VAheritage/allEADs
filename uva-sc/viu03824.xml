        <p>The papers were given to the University of Virginia Library on October 18, 1967 by Judge Smith.

        <head>Custodial History
</head>
        <p>When Judge Smith was ready to leave his congressional offices, he called upon the National Archives and Records Service to clean out his files, and pack the materials; this is a service offered to Congressmen
by NARS. NARS boxed up all the materials, and moved them across the Potomac to the Federal Records Center in Alexandria early in 1967.
</p>
        <p>Shortly thereafter, Judge Smith agreed to open his papers to the researchers of the Institute for Social Science Research, and the papers were moved a few blocks from the Federal Records Center to the third
floor of Judge Smith's son's law office building where space was made available to the Institute.
</p>
        <p>The Institute staff worked through the material and removed from the boxes those papers which interested them particularly. These papers they placed in eight filing cabinets in the offices, and a card index
file was prepared to assist in locating the materials. The remainder of the papers were kept in the NARS boxes and were stacked about the walls of the rooms. The collection was appraised at this time, and Mr.
Robert Metzdorf's notes on the contents give a good summary of its research value.
</p>
        <p>It took the Institute fifteen or sixteen months to complete its work in the files. They made notes, and copied all materials which they found pertinent their research. By agreement with Judge Smith, the
Institute has the right of prior publication of any material from the collection.

        <head>Processing Information
</head>
        <p>The papers have, in general, been kept in the order in which they were received from the Institute for Social Science Research. Because of the removal of a portion of the collection from the NARS boxes, it was
not always possible for the Library staff to determine exactly what the original order of the collection had been. We have moved certain blocks of materials that seemed to belong together to create series within
the collection, but very little moving of individual file folders has taken place. Thus, the researcher will find that there are minor inconsistencies in the chronological or alphabetical order in certain portions
of the series.

</head>
      <p>Howard Worth Smith was born in Broad Run, Fauquier County, Virginia, on 2 February 1883. He attended the public schools there and was graduated from Bethel Military Academy, Warrenton, Va., in 1901. In 1903, he
received his law degree from the University of Virginia, and entered the practice of law in Alexandria where he remained for the next eighteen years. He served as Commonwealth's attorney (1918-1922), judge of the
corporation court (1922-1928), and judge of the 16th circuit court (1928-1930).
</p>
      <p>In 1931, he was elected to Congress from the Eighth Congressional District, and remained in office for thirty-five years. He served as chairman, Committee on Rules (Eighty-fourth through Eighty-ninth
Congresses) and sponsor of the Smith Act of 1940. Smith was defeated for renomination in the Democratic primary in 1966.
</p>
      <p>Judge Smith resumed the practice of law in Alexandria, Va., where he died October 3, 1976. He was buried in Georgetown Cemetery, Broad Run, Va.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection consists of the files and working papers of Howard W. Smith who represented Virginia in Congress for some thirty-five years as representative from the Eighth Congressional District. Included are
correspondence received and carbon copies of replies, clippings, printed government and other publications, copies of printed bills, reports, press releases, speeches, notes, memoranda, financial records, tape and
disc recordings, drawings, and other materials. The papers cover the years 1933 to 1966 when Smith retired from Congress.
</p>
      <p>The collection is now contained in 274 Hollinger storage boxes (ca. 5"x15"x10"), one oversize box; additionally, there are eighteen looseleaf and scrapbooks, and forty-two architectural drawings. The collection
fills approximately 150 shelf feet.
</p>
      <p>Smith's influence in Congress came chiefly from his early appointment to the Rules Committee. In 1955, he became its chairman, an exceedingly powerful position as the committee can determine the "length and
manner of debate" on any measure moving from a committee to the floor of the House. "Although it was initially designed as a traffic committee to ease and expedite the flow of legislation in the House, the Rules
Committee by postponing or refusing to grant a bill a rule bottled up measures which did not win the approval of its conservative majority." (J. Harvie Wilkinson, III, H<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">arry Byrd and the
Changing Face of Virginia Politics, 1945-1966</title> [Charlottesville, 1968], 71.
</p>
      <p>Other research interests which may be studied in the collection, according to Mr. Robert Metzdorf, are: "political history of Virginia, relations of the Virginia and Southern Democrats to the rest of the
Democratic Party, labor unions and labor laws, lobbying, investigation of Un-Americian activities, alien registration, the Smith Act and subversion, history of the District of Columbia 1930-1966 [and legislation
in Congress pertaining to it as Smith sat on the District Committee], conservation and water pollution, Selective Service and other war-time legislation, the Supreme Court and State's rights, memorials to
Jefferson and Madison, the history of workmen's compensation, reappointment and the federal courts, civil rights, the Rules Committee and its role in the legislative process, the history of foreign aid, federal
aid to education, the history of immigration, relation between the legislative and executive branches, the history of conservatism in the United States, 1930-1966." To these notes may be added the study of unique
northern Virginia politics, patronage, and the continuing work of a Congressman in relation to his colleagues and in particular to his constituents. There does not appear to be much material in the collection
which shows Smith's relation to Senator Harry Byrd in the political sense, although there is interesting correspondence. Naturally, the collection will be the basis for any biography of Judge Smith, an important
historical task which, hopefully, will be undertaken soon.

      <head>Arrangement
</head>

belonging to an earlier Congress appears under a later one, it has been left where it was found on the presumption that the legislation may have carried over or that it was placed there for good reason. Note
especially the sub-series on Civil rights in boxes 100-111.
