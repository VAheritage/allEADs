      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Mosby Garland Perrow, Jr. was born on March 5, 1909, in
         Lynchburg, to Mosby Garland and Louise Polk (Joynes) Perrow.
         He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Washington and Lee
         University, and obtained his Bachelor of Laws from Duke
         University. He married Katherine Duane Wingfield of Lynchburg
         on June 24, 1938; they had three children: Duane Payne (Mrs.
         Wistar Palmer Nelligan); Mosby Garland, III; and Edmund
         Wingfield. In addition to farming and practicing law, Perrow
         was a member of the Virginia State Senate as a Democrat for
         twenty years. He was appointed chairman in 1959 of the
         Virginia School Commission known as the "Perrow Commission"
         which is given credit for saving public schools after the fall
         of massive resistance. He was a member of the Board of
         Directors of several private corporations and belonged to
         various civic organizations in the Lynchburg area.

         Who</title>by Richard Lee Morton (Historical Record
         Association, Hopkinsville, Kentucky, 1962).]</p>
      <p>The appointment of the "Perrow Commission" followed a
         series of legislation and actions influenced by the Supreme
         Court's segregation decision of 1954. In 1954, Governor Thomas
         B. Stanley appointed a commission charged with recommending
         means to prevent integration. Although he initially indicated
         that he would appoint a bi-racial group, he was influenced by
         Senator Garland "Peck" Gray to form a commission exclusively
         of state legislators, which eliminated all blacks from
         consideration since there were no blacks in the General
         Assembly. The "Gray Commission" held a public hearing on
         November 15, 1954, then held closed-door deliberations until
         its plan was revealed on November 11, 1955. The commission
         accepted limited integration, sanctioning inter-racial mixing
         in the schools if the local authorities chose that option.
         Drawbacks to the support of integration included the
         pupil-assignment plan and tuition grants for children choosing
         to attend private non-sectarian schools or public schools in
         other jurisdictions. It also urged that no child be forced to
         attend an integrated school. There was much debate and
         confusion over the referendum. During the 1955-1956 General
         Assembly session, the Gray Commission reversed itself,
         omitting the local option clause.</p>
      <p>In August 1956, the General Assembly was ordered by
         Governor Stanley to meet in special session. The "Stanley
         Plan," which included thirteen bills, was very detrimental to
         the maintenance of free public schools under court order to
         integrate. The plan was approved but did not actually come
         into use until September 1958. By this time, J. Lindsay
         Almond, Jr. was governor. Even though he was never in favor of
         the school- closing laws, he was forced to close several
         public schools around Virginia. School closings became a major
         and heated issue; massive resistance was more and more
         damaging to education and Virginia's image. After a speech in
         favor of massive resistance in January 1959, Almond realized
         the futility of upholding such a belief. He went before the
         General Assembly saying that the line against integration
         could no longer be held. He pushed for a more moderate
         program, which included the appointment of a commission to
         study the situation and recommend any further legislation to
         solve the problem.</p>
      <p>The commission was headed by Senator Perrow. When the
         report was made, it called for freedom of choice, or local
         option. Almond's "freedom of choice" legislation was passed,
         with narrow majorities, by the Senate and the House. The
         passage of this legislation lead to the end of massive
         resistance. Almond pushed aside his personal beliefs and made
         way for more modern and moderate political views in Virginia.
         Despite this progress, the controversy over integration
         continued for years.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection pertains to the personal, legal, and
         senatorial aspects of the life of Mosby G. Perrow, Jr., of
         Lynchburg, Virginia. Included are personal, legal, and
         political correspondence and papers. Personal correspondence
         includes letters of family members, friends, and
         acquaintances, and refers to family estates, finances, rental
         property, the Perrow farm in Campbell County, and involvement
         in Lynchburg matters. The legal correspondence and papers
         refer to Perrow family court and legal cases as well as
         various others. Political papers pertain to various
         legislation, and include letters from senators,
         representatives, and other political figures, and
         constituents. A large portion of these papers are concerned
         with the Perrow Commission and related matters on education
         and integration.</p>
      <p>Papers concerning the Perrow Commission, 1958-1959, include
         correspondence, memoranda, opinions, reports, and printed
         material. There is a statement, early 1958, from the Virginia
         Committee for Public Schools concerning the appointment of the
         commission and its goals; and, a copy of the resolution
         creating the commission. Correspondence from concerned
         citizens and parents, public school personnel and officials,
         and political figures express views and suggestions on various
         aspects of free public education and integration. Reports to
         the commission include reports from various committees and
         bills enacted by the General Assembly. There is further
         information on public education, including correspondence and
         papers of the Commission to Study the System of Public
         Schools, 1944-1947, and of various educational
         associations.</p>
