        <scopecontent>
          <p>Includes a letterbook, 1769-1776, of Roger Atkinson
               (1725-1784), a merchant who lived near Petersburg, and
               an account book for Atkinson, 1762, and for Thomas
               Atkinson, 1792-1803. The account book also contains some
               of Roger Atkinson's letters for 1775, and for several
               years in the 1780's. The letters contain numerous
               references to the business activities of this prosperous
               merchant and discuss the tobacco trade at length; there
               are occasionally mention of the prices of land and
               slaves. Numerous comments on the political difficulties
               with Great Britain are also scattered through the
               letters. An October 1, 1774, letter contains an
               evaluation of the members of Virginia's delegation to
               the First Continental Congress and a November 20, 1776,
               letter speaks approvingly of the new Assembly as the
               "Peoples' Men" and comments favorably on an act for
               religious disestablishment which was under
               consideration. During the post-war years, Atkinson
               proposed, March 13, 1786, to pay his debts to English
               creditors either by installments or by exchanging land
               for them. Unfortunately, the letters contain no
               information on his participation in the Revolution as a
               member of Captain Robert Bolling's militia unit or his
               views on reform of the Confederation government.
               Extracts from the letters have been published in the

          <p>One item, apparently a page from a letterbook,
               contains drafts of three letters of Thomas Nelson, Jr.,
               all dated October 1, 1781, and posted from camp near
               Yorktown. Subjects discussed are the need for faster
               communication between Richmond and Yorktown, the
               problems involved in supplying the allied armies with
               provisions, and arrangements for taking care of the sick
               under Admiral DeGrasse's command. (#7262)</p>

          <p>The personal and business papers of this
               "Barboursville," Orange County family, which include
               several letters from Cave and Robert Johnson discussing
               Indian problems in the early 1780's at Bryant's
               (Bryan's) Station, now in Kentucky, and the surrounding
               territory. A letter from Robert Johnson to Benjamin
               Johnson, June 28, 1789, claims that most of the people
               in "this country" are Antifederalists and that their
               convention will probably not decide to separate from
               Virginia. Other items of interest are an April 21, 1776,
               letter from General Charles Lee to Thomas Barbour
               proposing that he establish correspondence with his
               Florida connections and a payroll for Captain Benjamin

               Rochambeau's troops in 1780; the second volume,

               weekly returns of the regiment. Also included is a
               letter from General John Burgoyne to Colonel Phillipson,
               October 20, 1777, which discusses military conditions
               with emphasis on his ill-fated Saratoga campaign. There
               are also some papers relating to Baylor's brother, John
               (1750-1808), which contain an allegation of loyalism

               to the Berkeley family of "Barn Elms" and "Airwell"
               plantations. Most of the material relates to the
               post-Revolutionary era and the papers for the 1760-1790
               time period are mainly receipts, accounts, invoices, and
               other items relating to the operation of their
               plantation business. An occasional letter from merchants
               in England to Edmund Berkeley, Jr. mention politics,
               e.g., letters of Bosworth &amp; Griffith, February 27
               and March 31, 1766, which refer to the Stamp Act and its
               repeal. There are also a few letters from the London
               merchant, Samuel Athawes. Other pertinent items include
               Edmund Berkeley's commission as a lieutenant-colonel in
               the Middlesex County militia, and a 1774 Virginia
               Almanac with Berkeley's receipt for payment of his
               soldier's tax, June 27, 1781. There is also a photocopy
               of a badly mutilated printed letter [May 31, 1774] which
               calls for a meeting of the Burgesses on August l to

          <p>This collection includes the correspondence and other
               papers (23 items) of Theodorick Bland of Prince George
               County. Bland was a physician and ardent supporter of
               the Revolution who participated in several important
               military campaigns and from November 1778 to November
               1779 commanded the Albemarle Barracks where the
               Convention prisoners were housed. Among topics included
               in the papers are Matt Phripp's desertion to the enemy
               (1775), the affairs of the Convention Army, loyalism in
               Prince George County, the mutinous Pennsylvania line
               (1781), and Benedict Arnold's invasion of Virginia
               (1781). Also included is a scathing attack on the
               character and motives of Jacob Duche, a loyalist.
               Although there are several items pertaining to politics
               in Prince George County, there is nothing which reflects
               Bland's role in Virginia's Ratification Convention
               (1788) and his opposition to the Constitution. Many of
               these letters have been published in Charles Campbell
               (ed.),

               prior to 1760, relating to the tobacco trade between
               Virginia and Glasgow in the eighteenth century. A letter
               from Robert Gilchrist, Port Royal, Virginia, December
               12, 1787, praises the British government and expresses
               disgust with the state of affairs in America. (#5803)</p>

          <p>A commonplace book kept by Robert Bolling of
               "Chellowe" in Buckingham County containing poetry,
               sketches, explanatory notes, and songs. Some of the
               poems were printed in the

               Most of the poems are non-political; however, one
               entitled "The Scheme for the Maryland Liberty Lottery
               Travesti" written in 1767 satirizes Maryland's attempt
               to raise funds to send Charles Garth to England as an
               agent for the colony. (#8708-b)</p>

          <p>Microfilm copy of originals at Duke University
               Library includes John Hook's (d. 1808) letterbook and
               about ten letters and documents which concern the
               conflict between Hook and the Bedford County Committee
               of Safety. John Hook, a Scottish merchant of New London,
               Bedford County, Virginia, was charged with having said
               "there never would be Peace 'til the Americans get well
               flog'd," and was called before the Committee to explain
               his statement. There are also Hook's discussion of his
               treatment by a "mob," a "memorandum," apparently written
               by Hook, chastising the committee for its misconduct,
               and Hook's oath of allegiance to the State of Virginia.

               social life, family, legal and business matters, the
               U.S. Constitution, Virginia politics, Francis Preston,
               and Revolutionary War claims. A number of letters
               discuss state and national politics at length,
               mentioning the weakness of the Confederation, the
               prospects for a new Constitution, and the separation of
               Kentucky from Virginia, a cause for which Brown was
               actively working. On another issue, Brown complains
               (September 30, 1788) about the large number of lawyers
               practicing in the Danville [Kentucky] area, exclaiming,
               "By Heavens they must hunt Buffalo, or starve." (#2752)</p>

               families of value to the study of the early national
               period of American history. Materials for the
               revolutionary era consist largely of letters from
               Theodorick Bland, Jr. (1742-1790), to John Randolph, Jr.
               (1742-1775), and are concerned largely with family and
               business matters. A letter September ll, 1771, discusses
               a Prince Edward County election and an undated letter
               from Bland to Randolph, perhaps written in June 1775
               (folder "1770-1774"), mentions Lord Dunmore's departure
               from Yorktown and defense of the colony. St.George
               Tucker (1752-1827) writing to Theodorick and John
               Randolph, June 29, 1788, claims that the adoption of the
               Constitution will require the repayment of debts to the
               British. Other letters from Tucker discuss the young
               men's education and offer fatherly advice for a happy
               and prosperous life. (#3400)</p>

          <p>Material pertaining to the Revolutionary War consists
               of three typescript copies of letters to William
               Woodford (1734-1780) of Caroline County, one from John
               Taylor of Caroline (1753-1824) and two from Edmund
               Pendleton (1721-1803). Taylor, writing from
               Philadelphia, May 12, 1775, contrasts the humane conduct
               of the patriots at Lexington with the alleged atrocities
               committed by the British. He also reports on General
               Gage and the provincial army assembled at Boston and
               cites a Quaker regiment raised in Philadelphia as
               evidence of the populace's general support for the
               cause. Pendleton speculates, July 4, 1775, about British
               military intentions and on July 8, 1775, asks for
               reports about a recent battle in which Woodford was
               involved, possibly the Battle of Monmouth. (#38-486)</p>

          <p>This extensive collection contains a variety of
               personal and business papers relating to the Cocke and
               Cabell families, chiefly from "Bremo Recess," Fluvanna
               County. Revolutionary war materials include autograph
               letters and other items which reflect various military
               and political aspects of the era. Several letters to
               George Clinton, 1777-1780, relate to the war in New York
               and discuss problems with the raising of sufficient
               numbers of troops and supplies, the lack of adequate
               officer quarters, the difficulty in procuring medical
               supplies, frontier defense, and a Loyalist uprising in
               Ulster and Albany Counties. Papers relating to the
               Cabell family include a copy of an Amherst County
               certification of the military service of Colonel
               Nicholas Cabell of Amherst County which mention the
               possibility of leaving England for America and complains
               of economic burdens imposed on him by the "late war."
               Other items of interest include a letter from Nathaniel
               Greene to Colonel Henry "Light-Horse Harry" Lee, January
               12, 1781, emphasizing the importance of success in the
               Georgetown campaign, an exchange of correspondence
               between Arthur Lee and Benjamin Franklin while they were
               commissioners in France, and a letter from William Lee
               to his brother, Richard Henry Lee, April 13, 1781,
               seeking his brother's interposition with Congress to
               help obtain reimbursement for his services earlier in
               the war; he also discusses military setbacks to Great
               Britain in the East Indies, Benjamin Franklin's
               ownership of a ship which carried supplies from France
               to America, and a recent loan obtained by John Adams

               mentions that General Wayne will soon be in Georgia to
               take command, and expresses the hope that the enemy will
               soon be driven from Savannah. The other two letters
               written to General Twigg in 1788 refer to Indian
               uprisings and a treaty negotiation with the Creeks.

               preliminary calendar prepared by David C.
               Yalden-Thompson is at the beginning of reel M-549. Only

               Revolution, a letter from James Stirling, July 31, 1776.
               Stirling, who was apparently with the 42nd Highlanders,
               writes from Staten Island, describing the voyage to
               America, encounters with a privateer, and the loss of a
               British transport with part of Frazier's Regiment. He
               also describes the treatment by Americans of a captured
               British officer, the poor condition of American
               deserters, and the arrival of the Hessians. (#3610)</p>

               Revolution, and those of his son, Sir Graham Eden
               Hamond, bart. (1779-1862). The elder Hamond's papers
               consist mainly of official records relating to his very
               active and influential naval career and to his brief
               political assignment as Lieutenant-Governor of Nova
               Scotia, Commissioner of the Navy, and Commander-in-Chief
               in Halifax, 1781-1782. Highlights of his wartime career
               include his service in the coastal rivers of
               Pennsylvania and Virginia where he mastered the art of
               river warfare, and his role in the invasion of
               Charleston, 1780. The personal material, although
               limited, is of special significance. The personal
               correspondence (1766-1778) of Hamond with Hans Sloane
               and Hans Stanley gives the views of three Englishmen to
               the approaching separation of the colonies from England.
               Also of importance are Hamond's excellent narrative
               account, written from 1783 to 1785, of his role in the
               Revolution during the years, 1775-1777, and his
               autobiography which covers his career to 1794. Principal
               correspondents include: Marriot Arbuthnot, Robert Digby,
               John Murray, Earl of Dunmore, Lord George [Sackville]
               Germain, Lord Thomas Graves, William Hotham, Lord
               Richard Howe, John Montague, Peter Parker, Molyneux
               Shuldham, Philip Stephens, and William Tryon. Available
               on department microfilm (M-1722-1724). (McGregor

          <p>This collection includes the papers of James Hunter,
               Jr., a merchant of Scottish descent who lived in
               Fredericksburg, Virginia. Some papers provide data on
               supplies issued to the Continental Army by Hunter in his
               role as Commissary for Public Stores in Fredericksburg.
               The bulk of the material for the period of the
               Revolution consists of correspondence from Hunter's
               several business partners and contacts. These papers
               document the problems encountered by merchants during
               wartime: fluctuating market values for goods, inflation
               and currency depreciation, privateering, and
               confiscation of goods by the enemy. A few pre-war
               letters from Duncan Ingraham, Jr., a London merchant,
               mention political events, such as the Boston Port Act,
               and show enthusiastic support for the American cause. In
               general, however, the papers contain little reference to
               military and political events during the war and
               post-war years, except as they impinge on business
               activities. Some information is included on Hunter's
               speculative ventures, but little exists on his father,
               James Hunter, Sr., an owner of an iron foundry at
               Falmouth, Virginia. (#38-45, etc.)</p>

               are mainly the papers of William Watts (d. ca. 1798), an

               accounts, and miscellaneous papers such as drawings,
               music, and memorabilia of Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826).
               The bulk of the material relates to the 1770's and
               1780's and primarily concerns his personal affairs. Most
               items are original documents, but copies are included
               when the only originals are known to be in county court
               houses, in foreign repositories, or in private hands.
               Occasional items reflect his role as a delegate to the
               Second Continental Congress, as Governor of Virginia,
               and as the United States' Minister to France and deal
               with politics and military affairs at the state,
               continental, and international level. Complementing this
               material are microfilm and other copies of Jefferson's
               papers at the Library of Congress, the Massachusetts
               Historical Society, the Huntington Library, and from

          <p>Microfilm copies of typescript copies of four

               Lee (1739-1795) to business associates and to his
               brothers Richard Henry Lee (1732-1794) and Francis
               Lightfoot Lee (1734-1797). A partner in the firm of
               deBerdt and Sayre, London, Lee's letters chiefly concern
               the tobacco trade. However, letters to his brothers
               contain numerous comments of political events in England
               and the colonies with frequent references to prominent
               leaders in Virginia and England. The fourth volume is
               almost exclusively business in nature. The originals are
               at the Robert E. Lee Memorial Foundation, Stratford
               Hall. (#882)</p>

          <p>This collection consists primarily of the papers of
               Arthur Lee (1740-1792) and those of his brothers,
               Richard Henry (1732-1794) and William (1735-1795) from
               "Stratford Hall," Westmoreland County. The bulk of the
               material, comprised of originals and copies from various
               repositories, including the Library of Congress, Harvard
               University, and the American Philosophical Society,
               falls into the 1760's and 1770's and provides
               comprehensive documentation for virtually all aspects of
               the revolutionary era. Arthur Lee's letters begin in
               1760 when he was a medical student at the University of
               Edinburgh; later in the sixties, his letters and those
               of William Lee's, both of whom were in England, deal
               primarily with trade and commerce, but include frequent
               observations on English politics, the Stamp Act, and
               other topical issues. The collection is particularly
               valuable for revealing the development of a
               revolutionary spirit in America in the early 1770's and
               also sheds light on the diplomatic ventures in which
               Arthur and William Lee were involved. Correspondence to
               and from Richard Henry Lee reflect his involvement in
               Virginia and continental politics as a member of the
               House of Delegates (1780-1784), as a delegate to the
               Continental Congress (1774-1779), and as president of
               the Congress of the Confederation (1784-1786). Some
               insight into Richard Henry's assessment of the
               Confederation and his disenchantment with the
               Constitution is also included. Besides the Lees' papers
               and those of their relatives, there are included papers
               of John Adams, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, James
               and Joseph Gardoqui, Thomas Jefferson, the Marquis de
               Lafayette, Mrs. Catherine MacCauley, James Madison,
               James Monroe, Robert Morris, Edmund Pendleton, Adam
               Stephens, and George Washington, among others. The major
               portion of these papers has been microfilmed under the
               title, "Lee Family Papers, 1742-1795;" a published guide
               to the microfilm edition is available. Available on

               and the drain of labor for military service. He also
               discusses naval action at Hampton Creek and Ockracoke as

               1779, letter mentions public finances, defense of the
               state, the ratification by Virginia of the treaty with
               France, sale of public lands, the confiscation of
               Loyalist estates, and the naturalization of foreigners,
               among other topics. Writing as a delegate from the
               Philadelphia Convention, May 21, 1787, Mason speculates
               that the consensus seems to be to abandon the
               Confederation for a new national government; the letter
               includes a list of possible reforms of the Articles of

          <p>Includes a bound volume of letters written to and
               collected by Joshua and Thomas Gilpin of Philadelphia.
               Thomas Gilpin was a Quaker pacifist during the
               Revolution who, along with a group of Quakers, was
               exiled to Virginia in 1777 by Pennslvania's Supreme
               Executive Council. There is an exchange of
               correspondence between Gilpin and the Committee of Fifty
               in Philadelphia concerning actions of his which violated
               Committee orders and various other letters which give
               Gilpin's view on various issues and events of the
               Revolution. During the 1780's there is an exchange of
               letters between James Maury, a Liverpool merchant, and
               various correspondents, including his brother, Mathew
               Maury of Virginia. These letters are concerned mostly
               with personal and business affairs, but some mention the
               economic distress of Virginians caused by their debts to
               English merchants. (#3888)</p>

               &amp; Sons mercantile firm. Most of the material
               consists of correspondence and receipts pertaining to
               business matters, although several letters, 1769-1770,
               refer to the Townshend Acts. An October 14, 1769 item in
               this series mentions the letters of Junius Americanus
               (Arthur Lee). There is also a weekly return of the
               troops under Captain Muhlenburg's command, November
               1780-1781, and a document, July 5, 1783, certifying that
               John Burton of Caroline County served six months in the
               army without pay. Also included are a letter from John
               Page, President of the Council, to Colonel Lewis, 2nd
               Battalion of Minute Men, August 1, 1776, instructing
               Lewis to rendezvous for a campaign against the
               Cherokees; a commission, October 26, 1780, appointing
               Wilson Cary Nicholas a lieutenant of the volunteers;
               and, a return of men under the command of
               Brigadier-General Robert Lawson. Another relevant item
               is a "Register of Warrants," 1828, issued under a
               Virginia law entitled: "An act for the relief of certain
               Surviving Officers and Soldiers of the Revolution."

          <p>Contains several items pertinent to the revolutionary
               period. One, a 1780 broadside in French, is General
               Lafayette's proposal to the French Canadians inviting
               them to join forces with American and French forces.
               There is also Joseph Nourse's (1754-1844) "Wastebook",
               1773-1782, which contains accounts of his pay while
               secretary to General Charles Lee as well as accounts for
               various purchases of military supplies. A nineteenth
               century copy of a letter from Mrs. Elizabeth Fouace to
               William Nourse, March 10, 1782, describes the terms of
               release for William Nourse who had been held prisoner by
               the British. Correspondence between Joseph Nourse and
               Maria Nourse in the 1780's contain occasional mention of
               social activities in Philadelphia attended by various
               members of government. A microfilm copy (M-547) of a

          <p>Correspondence, diaries, and other papers of the
               Carter Family of "Sabine Hall," Richmond County,
               organized into three groups: the papers, 1650-1799, of
               Landon Carter (1710-1788), the papers of the Carter
               family, especially Robert Wormeley Carter (1734-1797)
               and his grandson, Robert Wormeley Carter (1797-1867),
               and the diary of Landon Carter, 1752-1778. Landon
               Carter's papers and diary are of major significance for
               the revolutionary era to his death in 1778; there is
               very little pertinent material for the 1780's. The
               collection richly documents the life and activities of
               an eighteenth century planter and a member of Virginia's
               ruling aristocracy. The papers are also significant for
               revealing the position and opinions of one who
               resolutely resisted Parliament's taxation and governance
               of the colonies, but who became less enthusiastic and
               more retiring politically as the issue of independence
               neared, fearing the currents of republicanism stirred by
               the resistance movement. Available on department
               microfilm (M-1790-1793). There is a published guide to
               the microfilm edition of the papers available from the

               When Washington failed to dissuade DeGrasse, Lafayette

               There are eleven letters in the Carter family papers, to
               or from John Coles of Albemarle County, or his wife,
               which relate to political and military matters, and
               include mention of Lord Dunmore, the landing of the
               British in South Carolina, the dissatisfaction of many
               Virginians with the heavy taxes on slaves, problems of
               inflation and paper money, and the military situation
               around Camden, S.C. Other pertinent items in the Smith
               family papers consist of a list of foreign officers
               serving in the Revolution, an account of the Battle of
               Camden, and a nineteenth century anecdote concerning
               Smallwood's Regiment, probably during the New York
               campaign, 1776. (#1729)</p>

               Thruston's regiment was one of the "additional" Virginia
               regiments attached to the Continental Line. Swearingen
               chronicles his military activities in three different
               periods of 1777: January 29-March 31, April 1-9, and
               September 10-November 13 and details the march northward
               to join Washington at Morristown as well as providing
               insight into various engagements during the New Jersey
               and Philadelphia campaigns. Also mentioned are various

               celebrations of the victories at Ticonderoga and
               Saratoga. There is also a fragment of a letter from John

          <p>An incomplete, nineteenth century copy possibly by
               Anna Eliot Ticknor wife of George Ticknor, of an account
               of Webster's visit with Jefferson at "Monticello,"
               December 1824 (misdated 1825). (The original is in the
               New Hampshire Historical Society). The extract includes
               Webster's observations about Jefferson's appearance and
               daily habits and relates several of Jefferson's
               recollections, including his visit with Comte de Buffon
               in France, the fast day in Virginia in 1774, the writing
               of the Declaration, and the character, abilities, and
               influence of Patrick Henry. There is also a sketch of
               the first floor at "Monticello," a feature not included
               in the original manuscript. Although the copy is not
               verbatim and is mistakenly dated "Dec. 1825," it is
               nonetheless a reasonably reliable version for the
               portion of the original which it covers. A published
               version, which also contains editorial errors and
               changes, may be found in

          <p>Letters and documents of a Scottish-American merchant
               family. The letters mention Lord Dunmore's seizure of
               the arms at Williamsburg, the response of Scottish and
               British merchants to events in America, the dismantling
               of the fort near Great Bridge, and the defeat of
               Burgoyne at Saratoga. Most interesting are several
               letters written by Gustavus Brown Wallace to his
               brother, Michael, while at Valley Forge and later, after
               the fall of Charleston in 1780, while a prisoner at
               Haddrel's Point, S.C. which gave informative accounts of
               the life of a soldier and the sufferings of prisoners of
               war. Of particular note is a letter from Gustavus to
               Michael Wallace, February 13, 1778, in which he reports
               on a movement in Congress to remove George Washington as
               commander-in-chief. Also mentioned is the attempt to
               destroy Howe's fleet by floating kegs of gunpowder among
               the ships, an event which inspired Francis Hopkinson's
               "Battle of the Kegs." (#38-150)</p>

               of the papers of Joseph and Robert Prentis, merchants in
               Williamsburg, and includes correspondence, receipts,
               accounts, colonial tax receipts, ledger and account
               books, and legal papers. This material provides rich
               documentation of the business activities of the
               Prentises with numerous Virginians and with various
               English merchants, including John Norton, Samuel
               Athawes, and Thomas Shrimpton before, during, and after
               the war. The correspondence with the English merchants
               provide occasional reference to debts and the loss of
               property. There are typed transcripts of some of the
               Prentis correspondence. There is also a group of papers

          <p>Correspondence and other papers of the Wormeley
               family of "Rosegill," Middlesex County, consisting
               primarily of letters and a letterbook of over 200
               letters of Ralph Wormeley, Jr. (1744-1806). Wormeley was
               a Loyalist who corresponded with a number of English
               merchants and political leaders. His papers not only
               provide information on his extensive business affairs
               connected with the management of his plantation, but
               also provide trenchant commentary on politics and events
               of the day, e.g. the Battle of Bunker Hill and the
               character of "rebels." Other topics covered are post-war
               economic relations with England, West Indian trade, the
               return of captured slaves, and the problems with
               Loyalist claims. There is a letter from Mann Page, Jr.,
               June 1, 1778, regarding the release of the Wormeley's
               from confinement and recommending that Ralph Wormeley
               take the Oath of Abjuration. An interesting item is an
               extract from a letter to Major John Grymes in which
               Wormeley defends John Adams' Defense of the
               Constitutions against charges of "monarchism;" he hopes
               that a strong government will result from the
               Philadelphia Convention and that "wisdom and virtue"
               will prevail over the "Sons of Anarchy and the
               bloodsuckers of America." Available on department
