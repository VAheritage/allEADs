         <p>This is a seven page typed (carbon) manuscript of the
         recollections of 
         <persname>Marie E. Morrison</persname>on "The Evacuation of 
         <geogname>Petersburg</geogname>and the entrance of the Federal
         Army on April 3, 1865." It is dated April 3, 1902, and bears
         several autograph corrections. The manuscript briefly mentions
         some of the events surrounding the retreat of the Army of
         Northern Virginia as well as a description (pages 5 to 7) of
         the burial of Private 
         <persname>Frank E. Coyle</persname>, 
         <corpname>3rd Company, Washington Artillery (Battalion) of New
         Orleans</corpname>.</p>
         <p>
            <persname>Frank E. Coyle</persname>was a resident of 
         <geogname>New Orleans, Louisiana</geogname>, and was employed
         as a clerk. On April 19, 1862, at the age of nineteen, he
         joined the 
         <corpname>Washington Artillery</corpname>in 
         <geogname>Richmond, Virginia</geogname>, and was wounded in
         action at 
         <geogname>Gettysburg</geogname>on July 3, 1863. Coyle
         continued to serve in the Confederate Army until his death in 
         <geogname>Petersburg</geogname>during April, 1865.</p>
         <p>Mrs. Morrison recalled how the body of "F. E. Cayle" was
         found propped up against the wall of the 
         <corpname>Second Presbyterian Church</corpname>by Reverend 
         <persname>Churchill Gibson</persname>on the morning of April
         3, 1865. A placecard attached to Coyle's chest identified him
         and his unit, claimed he had been "killed at the front on
         Sunday" [April 2], and requested that he be given a proper
         burial. Morrison describes how this was accomplished by her
         husband and neighbors with a military salute provided by a
         company of Union soldiers who postponed their pursuit of Lee's
         army in order to honor the slain Confederate.</p>
         <p>In a autograph postscript Morrison reports that the body
         was transferred to 
         <geogname>Blandford Cemetery, Petersburg</geogname>, in the
         autumn of 1865 as a result of efforts by a memorial
         association of which she was vice-president. [She was also the
         author of
