      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of several loose leaves from the
         diary of an unknown Union soldier, March-May 1864, "picked up
         during the war." He is believed to be a memeber of the 34th
         Massachusetts Infantry, with the diary primarily having been
         written near Martinsburg, Virginia (now West Virginia).</p>
      <p>(Undated) mentions that Col. Wells has arrived in
         Martinsburg, taking command of a brigade--reflects on a
         religious book he has read by Arthur [Vandeteur] and how it
         has made him a better Christian..</p>
      <p>Mar 9--dwells a bit more on the necessity of being a good
         Christian and writes that teams begin to come in about
         8'o'clock bringing "knapsacks and other things of
         importance."</p>
      <p>Mar 10--continues to implore the Lord for guidance and
         protection--mentions he has received a letter from "Father and
         Adelia, and also one from Edward." Edward's regiment had
         previously been in battle and lost a great many in killed and
         wounded.</p>
      <p>Mar 11--fifteen recruits join the regiment</p>
      <p>Mar 12--read a good book--The Little Captain--A Temperance
         Tale.</p>
      <p>Mar 13--read contents of a little book called The 10
         Premium Tracts--thinks them the best tract reading he has ever
         seen.</p>
      <p>Mar 18--Rev. M.M. Longley returned to the 34th and pitched
         a tent furnished by Christian Commission to hold
         services--visited him for a long talk.</p>
      <p>Mar 18--no prayer meeting at night because tent blew
         down.</p>
      <p>Mar 19--saw Brig. Gen. Averell (William Woods) in camp.</p>
      <p>Mar 20--Gen Averell taken ill suddenly and fears were for
         his life--dress parade at night and court martials of three
         men for drinking too much liquor. Rev. Longley preached sermon
         at evening prayer concerning debts sinners owe the Lord.</p>
      <p>Mar 21--went on picket duty to relieve Ohio men so they
         could escort their Colonel to the depot--reports a man in
         Martinsburg murdered his wife with an ax.</p>
      <p>Mar 22--off picket duty, but suffered during the night from
         cold--attended services at Chappell (sic) tent and later
         writes long plea to the Lord for guidance.</p>
      <p>Mar 23--writes that stockading of tents has begun and has
         consumed the day--attended prayer meeting.</p>
      <p>Mar 24 (written in Martinsburg where he is on provost
         guard)--visits room where Joseph M. [Lenciana], accused wife
         murderer is confined--said man thinks he will be hanged and is
         worried about his four chiildren--man says wife "had a secret
         in her heart" and wanted medicine to kill an as yet unborn
         child--prayed with the man.</p>
      <p>Mar 25--describes an incident concerning a controversy over
         benches he had built for Chappell tent.</p>
      <p>Mar 29--(on or about)--writes about the evil spirit that
         dwells within him and says he intended to read his message to
         his companions at Chappell tent, but did not.</p>
      <p>Apr 1--reports that 150 Testaments from Christian
         Commission have arrived and been distributed at 34th infantry
         camp--unit has received marching orders.</p>
      <p>May 8--Camp near Winchester--reflects that in reading his
         journal thinks he is apt to take too much part in what is
         going on in camp "which tends to keep me from enjoying a
         Christian life as I should"-- implores the Lord for
         strength.</p>
      <p>May 9--regiment ordered out in the A.M. and marched to an
         orchard near Kernstown, where the men stacked arms and waited
         for a cavalry unit to pass before continuing.</p>
