      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of nine individual letters and a
         letter book kept by Leon F. Stevens, containing the
         correspondence between Stevens, stationed with the 168th
         Company, Coast Artillery [Company?], at Fort Monroe, Virginia,
         in 1916, and his fiancee, Hope, who was working as a nurse in
         Hartford, Connecticut. The letters are chiefly concerned with
         their courtship and engagement, and his plans to leave the
         Army on July 7, 1916, but occasionally mention other
         topics.</p>
      <p>These subjects include: seeing a ship captured by the
         Germans on the high seas, rumored to be a passenger liner
         plying between England and South America, which will probably
         be interned at Newport News or Norfolk, Virginia (1916 Feb 1);
         exhibitions of flying machines and the aviator school at
         Newport News, Virginia (1916 Feb 2); Stevens' attitude, as a
         Northerner, to the race relations between white and black
         Southerners (1916 Mar 5); the visit of Woodrow and Edith
         Wilson to the area (1916 Mar 13); concern over whether the
         United States could be drawn into World War I (1916 Mar [14]);
         and in his last entry of the letter book, Stevens informs Hope
         that his company will go to Georgia on April 13 for
         mobilization in the field service, possibly for use along the
         border with Mexico (1916 Apr 9).</p>
