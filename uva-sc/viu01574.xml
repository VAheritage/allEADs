            of 2,000 and lost his souvenirs and kit on the trip (Mar

        <p>His letters continue with a description of his regiment
            returning to the front, when a wild boar chased by dogs ran
            through their marching column, being shaved by a French
            lady barber, April first jokes played along the route, a
            visit to a walled town with a canal and moat around it, a
            sighting of a German Observation Balloon, marching through
            the deep mud, Campbell performing guard duty at the supply
            wagon after his unit reached their destination, and a
            description of the next day's hike to their dugouts under
            the view of the Germans in the hills, who would send over a
            barrage of high explosives and gas causing the soldiers to
            have to wear masks quite often (Apr 16); description of
            life in the cave dugouts (Apr 19); gas warfare and dugouts
            (Apr 20); his last quarters in mule stables, the frequent

            constant trouble with lice, and his daily sponge bath with
            water that has collected in shell holes (Apr 25); feeding
            crumbs to the birds (Apr 28); the Y.M.C.A. sponsored talent

            and notification he was to go to the trenches as an
            observer (May 12).</p>
        <p>Campbell's letters continue with a description of his
            work as an observer, watching for new developments behind
            the German lines and for rockets at night, using equipment
            called "scissors" with an extension at a right angle for
            peering over the tops of the trenches, mentioning the book 
            <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Over the Top</title>by Arthur Guy
            Emprey describing life at an observation point, patronizing
            a delousing machine which visited a nearby town where they
            had their clothes and blankets sterilized and living behind
            six feet of concrete which recently took a direct hit of a
            "big boy" (May 15 &amp; 20); the use of their tin hats as
            candlesticks at night, feeling the earth move when the

            Senegalese troops (May 19); descriptions of bombardment and
            aerial battles near the front, mention of his appreciation
            for the work of the Salvation Army and the Red Cross

            people, young French women putting up the hay crop caused
            quite a few American soldiers to volunteer to help them,
            the town where he was stationed located on the banks of a
            river, the difficulty of moving horses by train, and his
            movement from chateau to chateau until present at the front
            on O.P. duty again (Jun 7); his observation and liaison
            work with the infantry, living in dugouts, his present

            first time since August 1914 as a result of a great victory

            kitchen (Jun 13 &amp; Sep 2); rodent problems while in the
            forests and a baseball game between the officers and the

            Company is split into five or six detachments and his swim
            in the [Meuse River ?] (Jun 30).</p>
        <p>The remainder of his letters in 1918 discuss: the
            movement from trench warfare to open warfare, living in a
            fox hole (6 x 4 x 3), eating only bread and bacon, and his
            bed of straw with his pup tent over the top of the foxhole
            (2 letters, Jul 11); reports on the progress of the
            American infantry against the enemy (Jul 19); achievement
            of a year's service and a description of an aerial battle
            (Jul 28); after a period of rest, Campbell is now in
            another sector and back into the army routine in the "zone
            of advance" against the Germans (Sep 11 &amp; 22); the
            death of Jack Follen (Oct 5); acting as a courier for the

            from corporal to private by a different "click" of
            sergeants, volunteering for K.P. duty to avoid the
            sergeants, his court-martial for refusing to groom a
            vicious horse and the fine of three months pay, and his
            return to the front during the past week (Oct 26);
            presently billeted in the small town of Culey, France, in a
            barn and his enjoyment of the Thanksgiving dinner (Nov 29);

            at the point of the salient at the toughest fighting (Dec
            6); formerly at Verdun (Dec 11); and his belief that the
            Y.M.C.A. neglected his 26th Division (Dec 13).</p>
        <p>Letters written in 1919 discuss the following: stationed
            at Varennes sur Amance waiting to go home (Jan 1-19);
            stationed at Mayet, France, and the football tournament of
            the A.E.F. troops (Jan 26); the production of "Headquarters
            Company Minstrel Troops" which appears to be the most
            common form of entertainment for the troops performed by
            themselves and the football tournament (Feb 2); rumors they
            are soon to be en route to the Le Mans embarkation camp
            (Feb 4 &amp; 9); the wild boar hunt (Feb 13); on furlough
            to Le Mans, Paris, Lyon, Nice, Dijon, France, and touring a
            little of Italy and Monaco, probably will be home in April
            (Feb 27 &amp; Mar 9); and a telegram to Mrs. J.A. Campbell
            informing her of Fowler Campbell's arrival at Dorchester,
            Massachusetts, and his destination of Camp Devens (Apr
            10).</p>

        <head>Correspondence of Captain M.B.S. Fleisher</head>
        <p>M.B.S. Fleisher ("Shorty") was a dentist from New York
            City who addressed his letters to Miss Madeline M. Mayer,
            also a New Yorker. During the time covered by most of these
            letters, January 1918-April 1919, Fleisher's served as a
            1st Lieutenant with the 6th U.S. Infantry. In the beginning
            letters, he was stationed at the Base Hospital, Camp
            Gordon, near Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
        <p>Topics in Fleisher's letters in 1918 include: his
            leading all other doctors in numbers of patients treated
            for the month of December in spite of the fact his
            treatment usually involved fillings rather than
            extractions, the bustle of preparing to travel overseas,
            the request for him to contribute an article, "The Saving
            of Soldier's Teeth," for the 
            <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Army &amp; Navy Dentist
            Journal</title>, his visit to Fort MacPherson where the
            U.S. government kept German prisoners, allowing them to
            play football and paying them for their labor (Jan 11); saw
            16,000 men of the division commanded by General Burnhem
            leave for overseas duty at midnight and noted that sixteen
            men died last week from measles and pneumonia (Jan 27);
            presently with the 6th U.S. Infantry, Camp Forrest,
            Military Brigade, Chattanooga, Tennessee; in preparation
            for departing overseas, he is very busy giving physical
            examinations to all the men who are in two groups, at camp
            and at the rifle range twenty-two miles away at Catoosa
            Springs. He traveled to Catoosa Springs on horseback,
            examined all mouths present, and accompanied by 800 men of
            the 6th Infantry, saw a raging forest fire on the way back.
            Their advance guard known as the billeting officers had
            previously left for France on Monday to select proper
            billets for the men of the regiment (Mar 1). They received
            news that their special billeting detachment made it safely
            to France and then he tells how a prisoner trying to escape
            was shot at their camp by a sentry (Mar 17).</p>
        <p>While in France, Fleisher writes about the progress of
            the war, the tragedy of the patrol commanded by Captain
            R.H. Graham, which was challenged by a German string post,
            fired upon with guns and grenades, and resulted in the
            death of Graham who urged his men on as he was dying (Aug
            8); the success of the new offensive against the Germans,
            treatment of soldiers from 4 a.m. through the next day, 20
            hours on his feet and forty-eight without sleep (Aug 21);
            his transfer from the regiment to the field hospital not as
            a dentist and oral surgeon but as an anesthetist, his
            probable return to the front after his period of rest as
            part of the hospital 5th Sanitary Train (Sep 5); stationed
            in the woods near Verdun with the temperature at 15 degrees
            above zero, in a pup tent with the mud almost knee deep,
            hasn't been able to wash his hands or face for four days
            (Oct 9); spent the night in a German dugout and writing on
            paper left by another regiment (Oct 20).</p>
        <p>Following the Armistice, he writes: on the day the
            Armistice was signed his regiment had advanced furthest
            across the River Meuse, he was almost killed by shells
            dropped by the enemy after one of their planes with Allied
            markings flew over Brandyville checking the town for any
            Allied troops, talks about the appalling stories he has
            heard from French civilians about German behavior,
            especially the German work details for children, old men
            and women, and German treatment of their P.O.W.s and his
            pride in being an American and part of the liberating force
            (Nov 24); now on garrison duty in Trier, Germany, the 6th
            Regiment having led the whole American force into Germany
            on November 26, on the third day of the march it arrived at
            Luxembourg, entering German territory again on December 1,
            noting that Trier had only 200 Jews, 1,000 Protestants, and
            the remainder were Catholics, "The Jews are few and far
            between and even if we do find one it is hard to get him to
            admit it because of the great prejudice that exists" (Dec
            8); Christmas celebration at Trier (Dec 26); and his
            observation that the treatment of the Germans is not nearly
            as severe as their own treatment of the civilians in France
            and Belgium, and remarks upon the prosperity of the German
            middle class compared to France (Dec 31).</p>
        <p>Letters from 1919 all were written from his new position
            as adjutant to the colonel who is director of the [Medical
            ?] School at the American University, Beaune Cote d'Or,
            France, giving instruction in Bacteriology and Pathology,
            and helping to care for 10,000 patients (Mar 30 &amp; Apr
            13); encloses a copy of "The A.E.F.U. Students' Lord's
            Prayer" which begins, "Our Father who is in Washington,
            Baker be thy name" (Apr 13); his eagerness to go home
            causing his restlessness even with new and heavy
            responsibilities (Apr 20); the American University will
            close the early part of June, enabling him to go home if
            the Peace Treaty is signed by then, and is now a Captain
            (May 11); and describes the impromptu University of
            Pennsylvania Alumni Dinner at the American University,
            Beaune Cote d'Or, with the oldest alumnus present from the
            Class of 1887 (May 25).</p>
