      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of microfilm of four bound
         manuscript volumes, recording the transactions of patrons of a
         general store located at Fredericks Hall, Louisa County,
         Virginia. The first two volumes are account ledgers which
         cover the years 1735-1738, and 1756. The other two volumes are
         daybooks which contain entries for April 1845-December 1848
         and February 1855-December 1859.</p>
      <p>The two ledgers (1735-1738 and 1756) in this collection are
         from a general store located in Louisa County, Virginia, and
         record the transactions of a store's patrons.</p>
      <p>Louis County was not officially established until 1742, a
         year falling between the dates of these ledgers. Thus, in
         comparison to the "older" counties to the east, this region
         was not far removed in time from being the "frontier." Besides
         the few families that may have kept various written records,
         there were few institutions besides the court house to keep
         written records that would document daily life of the people
         in the area. Thus, the general store, being one of the centers
         of trade, created records of significant historical value. The
         first census of the county would not be taken until 1790, and
         that census, as well as the 1800 census, would later by
         destroyed in the War of 1812. As many of these ledgers may not
         appear in extant court records or other documents, much of the
         information in these volumes is unique.</p>
      <p>Not only do the accounts give the names of many of the
         residents, and furnish information about what supplies the
         patrons purchased, but they show how - and when - the accounts
         were settles. Out of necessity, the general store fulfilled
         many of the functions of a banking institution, extending
         credit to patrons to make purchases and arranging for
         excahnges of credit among the patrons to settle debts. Cash
         was scarce, and often patrons settled their accounts in
         produce, or with returned merchandise. It is also interesting
         to note that credit was given to a few women and blacks, as
         well as men, and in the 1756 ledger, the occasional notes
         giving the kinship of some patrons, or their occupations.</p>
      <p>The first of the two ledgers contains entries fro the years
         1735-1738. This volume was apparently a successor to an
         earlier volume, as many of the accounts begin with the entry,
         "By ballance due brought from [ledger] A folio ___." And it
         appears that ownership of the store changed hands in April
         1738, as many of the accounts at that time are closed with the
         statement, "Ballance due to Thomas Partridge," [the new
         owner].</p>
      <p>This volume is foliated at the upper left corner of the
         debit (Dr) pages. A number of pages, however, are misssing,
         and several numbers are repeated, as noted below. In the
         course of preparing the index which follows, later entries
         yielded the names of the patrons for two of the credit pages
         for which the debit pags are missing. Page 4 (R) is the credit
         portion of the accoutn of Cornelius Dabney, and page 167 (R),
         for Evan Mitchell.</p>

      <p>The second of the two ledgers contains entries for the year
         1756, and apparently was the third ledger in a series of
         subsequent to the series in which the volume for 1735-1738 was
         a part. Many of the accounts begin with the entry, "To
         ballance his acct. [from] Ledger B folio___," and are closed
         with the statement, "To ballance carried to his credit [in]
         Ledger D." As in the case of the first volume, the pages are
         foliated in the upper left corners of the Debit (Dr) pages,
         and a number of pages are missing, as noted below. Other pages
         have had portions removed.</p>
      <p>Unlike the first volume, this ledger occasionally notes the
         family relationships or occupations of the patrons, and the
         locality or the county in which the patrons resided (see index
         which follows). The inclusion of entries for the counties of
         Caroline, Orange, Halifax, Albermarle (or "Rockfish") and
         Spotsylvania, is an indication that a number of the patrons
         were not "local" residents, but merely passed through Louisa
         County on their way to Richmond, Williamsburg, etc.</p>

      <p>The two daybooks (1845 April-1848 December, and 1855
         February-1859 December) in this collection reveal that the
         location of the store was at Fredericks Hall. Unlike the two
         ledgers, which contain both debits and credits recorded under
         individual accounts of the patrons, these volumes were a part
         of a more sophisticated system. Daily transactions are
         recorded chronologically, rather than directly in the patron's
         account. Periodically, the propietor entered the sum of the
         transactions for each patron in a separate account ledger (not
         present in the collection) and noted the page number of that
         account to the left of the daybook entry.</p>
      <p>Given the large number of individual entries in these
         volumes, and the fact that census records for the period
         covered by the daybooks are extant, indexes to these were not
         prepared.</p>
      <p>Interesting comparisons can be made between the types of
         merchandise purchased as recorded in these daybooks and the
         types of merchandise that was purchased a century earlier, as
         recorded in the two ledgers.</p>
      <p>The first of the two daybooks contains chronological
         entries from April 1845 to December 1848. The volume is
         paginated in the upper outside corner of each page. As noted
         below, a number of pages are missing, and some page numbers
         are repeated. Portions of other pages have been torn out. This
         volume has suffered futher damage as a result of having been
         shot with a shotgun through both the front and back
         covers.</p>

      <p>The second of the two daybooks contains chronological
         entries from February 1855 to December 1859. Blank pages
         following the daybook entries were later used for excercises
         in French (not filmed) and to record copies of three letters.
         The volume is paginated in the upper outside corner of each
         page. As noted below, a few pages are missing, and a portion
         of page 137-138 has been torn out.</p>
