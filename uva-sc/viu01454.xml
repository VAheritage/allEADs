      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This letter, April 2, 1844, from Charles Cocke, Esmont,
         Virginia, to C.L. Mosby, describes the shock and dismay of
         Cocke over the financial default of Sydnor, his worry over the
         amount of his own liability, and his anger at being swindled
         by a friend. He had entered into the arrangement and signed
         the bond only because of the assurance of T. Holcombe and C.L.
         Mosby that they would keep the interest down and that the bank
         would give him until the end of their charter to pay the
         debt.</p>
      <p>Cocke goes on to describe how the circumstances of Sydnor's
         finances were not at all as he had been told. The amount of
         the loss was equal to the value of all his property and he
         fears he will be left a beggar. A lawyer told him that his
         liability stemmed from mistakenly signing the bond. Cocke
         believes that the fault lies with the bank which did not
         demand payment from Sydnor while the amount was still small.
         He also mentions that Sydnor had sixteen slaves at the time of
         his death but the sale price was conveyed by a deed of trust
         to Baskerville instead of being used as security for the bond.
         Cocke plans on contesting the claim of the bank which acted
         irresponsibly.</p>
