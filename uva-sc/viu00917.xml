        <head>Provenance</head>
        <p>The Low Moor Iron Company ceased operations in 1930;
            what happened to the records of the company in the years
            immediately following is not known, but in 1939, the Green
            Bookman, a Charlottesville bookshop, sold the records to
            the University of Virginia Library.</p>
        <p>The records arrived at the receiving room door of the
            new Alderman Library on October 16, 1939, in a trailer
            truck whose load was estimated to weigh about fourteen
            tons. As the manuscripts staff dug around in the piles of
            over 1200 account books, and countless boxes of papers they
            realized that the company had saved almost all of its
            papers including checks, invoices, vouchers, and receipts,
            and certain of these records were destroyed as their
            information was recorded in other records. Once the bulk of
            the collection had been reduced, the remaining records were
            transferred to the stack area of the Division of Rare Books
            and Manuscripts.</p>
      </custodhist>
      <processinfo>
        <head>Processing Information</head>
        <p>By 1958, little storage space remained in Alderman
            Library, and the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division was
            especially crowded because of the rapid growth of its
            collections. After an examination of its storage areas, the
            division's staff decided to move the Low Moor records to
            the attic of one of the student dormitories. The collection
            had had little use chiefly because there was no finding
            aid. There seemed little likelihood of extensive researcher
            use until the collection could be processed.</p>
        <p>In preparation for the move, the old letter boxes in
            which much of the collection had arrived in the Library
            were discarded. The records from each box were placed
            between sheets of the heavy gray cardboard used to protect
            unbound newspapers in the Library's stacks, and the spine
            labels of the old letter boxes were copied onto the
            cardboard. The resulting bundles were wrapped with brown
            Kraft paper and tied up with string. The bundles were
            numbered. Whatever original order the letter boxes may have
            had was lost by the time they arrived in the Library, and
            after the bundling, removal to a dormitory attic, and
            subsequent return to the Library in 1976, all vestiges of
            the original order were lost.</p>
        <p>The bundles remained in the dormitory attic for almost
            twenty years. Occasional visits were made by the division
            staff to check on their condition, and on very rare
            occasions, a researcher was brave enough to ask to be shown
            the collection. Once the researcher saw the imposing amount
            of material and the conditions in the attic, interest in
            using the collection invariably died.</p>
        <p>In late 1976 a grant from the National Endowment for the
            Humanities was obtained to allow the Library to process the
            Low Moor Iron Company papers, and the papers of Edward L.
            Stone and the Borderland Coal Company, another large
            collection of records stored in the same dormitory attic.
            All of these records and papers were moved back to the
            Library where the bundles were cleaned and opened. The
            contents of each were placed in a Hollinger storage box,
            and all notes on the paper wrappings and on the gray
            cardboard sheets were recorded.</p>
        <p>The more than 1200 bound accounting records of the Low
            Moor Iron Company were surveyed by the grant project staff.
            The contents of each volume were noted on a mimeographed
            form, and later typed on 3 x 5" cards to create a
            readily-accessible file for the Manuscripts Reading Room.
            This information was also typed on pages to be added to
            this guide.</p>

      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The Low Moor Iron Company, the first producer of pig
         iron in Virginia according to the company's claims, was a
         self-contained manufacturing unit producing from its own
         mines the coal, limestone, and iron ore needed for its iron
         production. Located in Low Moor near Clifton Forge in
         Alleghany County in western Virginia, an area rich in
         mineral deposits, the company was in operation from
         1872-1930, producing only pig iron; it never attempted to
         produce finished iron products.</p>
      <p>Coal came to the Low Moor furnaces from the Kay Moor
         Mines at Kay Moor, West Virginia, about thirty miles from
         Low Moor; limestone was produced from the Low Moor
         limestone quarries; and iron ore came from the Fenwick,
         Dolly Ann, Jordan, Rich Patch, Low Moor, and Longdale
         Mines, most of them within twenty miles of Low Moor at
         Covington or Clifton Forge.</p>
      <p>The towns of Low Moor and Kay Moor were company towns in
         every respect. Workers lived in company-owned houses,
         bought food in company stores, worshiped at the company
         church, saw movies in the company theater, were treated in
         the company hospital, and were buried in the company
         cemetery. Workers received part of their pay in scrip that
         they exchanged for goods and services. According to a
         statement from the Kay Moor Mines dated November 1904, Kay
         Moor then employed 338 people, paid them an average wage of
         $36.26 per month, and issued half of their pay in scrip.
         Kay Moor had four stores; Low Moor had seven or eight. All
         of these stores carried large inventories which are
         detailed in the collection. These inventories are valuable
         to anyone interested in determining the wants and needs of
         a coal miner and his family.</p>
      <p>In the late 1910's and 1920's Kay Moor had a company
         theater called the Azure Theater which seated about 300
         people. There were also plans for a company-owned social
         center, to have pool tables, a soda fountain, and
         provisions for dancing and skating. The company was in
         tough economic straits by the 1920's, however, and there is
         no evidence that the social center was built. The town of
         Low Moor was so completely under the company's influence
         that one of Low Moor Iron Company's assistant managers
         served as the town sheriff. He often foreclosed on people
         who did not pay their debts, and drove troublesome people
         "out of town on a rail" as he put it.</p>
      <p>The Low Moor Iron Company's fortunes fluctuated during
         the various business cycles between the years 1880-1930.
         Low Moor was one of the larger pig iron producers in
         Virginia, but Virginia pig iron production was not
         important nationally. Low Moor officials sometimes sold
         their product themselves, but more often they used agents,
         the prevalent method at the time. Low Moor Iron Company
         used a variety of agents through the 1900's. James F. Bryan
         acted as the exclusive agent for the sale of Kay Moor Coal
         from September 21, 1903 to September, 1905. From about 1890
         until about 1910 Dalton Nash and Company were the exclusive
         eastern agents of Low Moor Iron. After that time the
         exclusive agency went to Philips Isham and Company located
         in New York. From about 1890 the western agency was handled
         chiefly by Thomas Mack and Company. After 1902 Thomas Mack
         and Company underwent a name change, becoming Walter
         Wallingford and Company, with offices located in
         Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, and Chicago.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the Low Moor Iron Company's biggest problem over
         the years was obtaining railroad cars for the
         transportation of its finished product. Low Moor Iron
         Company had its own cars for transporting its raw materials
         among its various facilities. For the long haul necessary
         for its finished goods, however, it depended upon the
         services of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, and the
         relationship was not always a happy one. The Low Moor
         Company complained many times to the C &amp; O Railroad
         about the discrepancies between long-and shorthaul freight
         rates. Low Moor also had trouble getting cars from the C
         &amp; O. In a letter to one of Low Moor Company's agents
         from an irate customer dated 1898, the customer wrote: "We
         wrote you on Saturday and endeavored to question upon your
         mind the necessity of taking care of us with Low Moor iron.
         We are on our uppers--there is not a pound of Low Moor iron
         in the yard. Of the one hundred tons ordered some time ago,
         not one pound of it has been received." This was, according
         to the Low Moor Iron Company, because they could not get
         the railroad cars. In a letter from Thomas Mack and Company
         dated November 26, 1901, to General Manager E. C. Means:
         "We are hopeful that the car supply will get better because
         of the number of orders you have of ours for prompt
         shipment. Our customers are complaining that they are not
         getting the iron fast enough. . . . We hope that the
         railroad will be able to supply you with empty cars." In
         another letter dated 1916 to John B. Guernsey, then acting
         General Manager of the Low Moor Iron Company, "We were not
         supplied with coke cars for today's loading, and
         consequently we have been practically down of Kay Moor
         ovens all day."</p>
      <p>The problem of procuring labor also plagued the Low Moor
         Company. The company sometimes tried to hire immigrant
         laborers and send the men directly to Low Moor from New
         York City. There were problems with this, as is explained
         in the following letter dated April 7, 1906: 
         <blockquote><p>To Mr. George Wickes 
            <lb/>Supt. of Mines 
            <lb/>Kay Moor, Virginia 
            <lb/></p><p>Dear George, 
            <lb/>Tony arrived with twenty one men last night. One
            got away in Jersey two in Washington D.C., four in
            Charlottesville. Some of the men are very good looking,
            but taken as a whole they are the worst lot I have ever
            seen: Irish, German-Jews, and Italians. . . . Our New
            York transportations to this place have never been a
            success.</p><p>Signed, 
            <lb/>Ed D. Wickes Supt. of Mines</p></blockquote>Low Moor usually employed labor agencies, one
         of which was Atwood's Employment Agency. Often the Low Moor
         Company would request certain nationalities, believing them
         to be better workers than others. Sometimes the company
         would request a gang of twenty made up of "ten Greeks and
         ten Italians." Many of the immigrants fled Low Moor and Kay
         Moor when they learned that they would have to work
         underground. There is a fair amount of material on
         immigrant labor and its procurement in the collection, and
         it is noted in the description of the box contents.</p>
      <p>Low Moor Iron Company not only had trouble procuring
         labor, but it also had trouble with labor already employed
         in the mines and at the factory. Labor dissension and
         strikes troubled the Kay Moor Mines through the 1900's. The
         great coal strike of 1902 hurt the Low Moor Company's coal
         mining operation, but by 1903 things were "nearly back to
         normal" according to the mine superintendent. There was
         still trouble at Kay Moor Mines, however. In a letter dated
         April 26, 1906, to the treasurer of Low Moor Company, the
         manager of the mines wrote about the trouble in "trying to
         get the agitators out." The mines were seventy-five men
         short of the total labor force needed because many of the
         coal miners returned to their farms during the spring.
         There were rumblings of another strike at Kay Moor, the
         result of which was to be a fourteen percent increase in
         wages for the Kay Moor Mine workers via an agreement with
         the United Mine Workers Union in December.</p>
      <p>The Low Moor Iron Company grew along with the rest of
         Virginia industry in the 1890's and 1900's. Starting with
         only one furnace in the 1870's, it opened a second furnace
         at Covington, Virginia, in 1891. In 1911 it opened a third
         furnace, this time at Low Moor. Covington, with its heavy
         industry, soon became known as the "Pittsburgh of
         Virginia." Virginia's pig iron production rose from 9,000
         short tons in 1870 to 544,034 long tons in 1903. Judging
         from the Low Moor Company's correspondence, the most
         prosperous period for the company fell between the years
         1895-1907. In the years between 1907-1917 problems befell
         the Virginia pig iron industry. In a letter from William W.
         Hearns, the president of the Virginia based Princess Pig
         Iron Company, to U. S. Senator Thomas S. Martin, Hearns
         writes of the problems of the Virginia pig iron industry:
         "There is not a blast furnace in Virginia that is making
         any money from the manufacture of pig iron. The cause of
         this is there is an exceedingly low price on pig iron in
         the country at the present time, and the increased cost of
         manufacturing is due to the increase in wages in all
         lines." With the outbreak of World War I prices rose
         dramatically, but in a market report to Low Moor dated
         November 11, 1916, it was stated that: "In spite of the
         high prices, it is not a picnic to be in the iron industry.
         There is a desperate shortage of cars and equipment in the
         coal and iron districts, and in consequence there are
         troubles of all kinds to get materials shipped. The
         situation has grown serious."</p>
      <p>When America became involved in the First World War, it
         meant a boost for the Low Moor Iron Company. The government
         helped it procure labor, and even helped it repair its
         furnaces. The problem of supplies and cars for their
         shipments, however, plagued the company more than ever. It
         had a good deal of trouble getting all the raw materials it
         needed due chiefly to the "tight ship" run by Harry F.
         Byrd, Sr., U.S. Fuel Administrator for Virginia. After the
         war very serious problems began to trouble the Low Moor
         Iron Company. The demand for iron fell precipitously and a
         short but severe depression ensued from 1919-1922. The
         depression seemed to hit the iron industry especially hard.
         Prices took a huge drop due to the lack of demand, and many
         pre-war contracts had to be revalued. To compound the
         company's problems, the Kay Moor Mines went on strike in
         1919. This strike was quickly settled, as the market for
         coal was so good that the Low Moor Company ceased taking
         orders temporarily in 1921 as it could not fill the orders
         it had on hand.</p>
      <p>The Low Moor Company furnaces lay idle for some twenty
         months. Finally, in November 1922 one of Low Moor's
         furnaces was finally fired up. While prosperity gradually
         returned to the rest of the country, the Low Moor Iron
         Company never recovered. Production of pig iron in the
         Virginia iron industry declined from 544,034 tons in 1903
         to 148,053 tons in 1923, considered a good year for the
         industry as a whole. In February 1926 Low Moor officials
         talked of merging with two other iron companies in order to
         revive the iron business for the three companies. The
         merger, however, never occurred. By late 1926 the company
         was in the process of liquidation. An advertisement in the
         Charleston, West Virginia, Daily Mail dated April 30, 1927,
         told of a huge warehouse sale at the Low Moor Iron Company.
         The advertisement noted "thousands of screws, pipe
         fittings, valves, etc." The last piece of correspondence
         from the Low Moor Iron Company in the collection is dated
         1929. It deals with the sale of a machine.</p>
      <p>Why did the iron industry in Virginia decline as it did?
         Some say that lack of speed, efficiency, and a decent
         transportation system for Alleghany County caused it. In a
         letter from C. E. Bertie, secretary of the Virginia Pig
         Iron Association, to the 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Manufacturers Record</title></bibref>dated 1925, Bertie claimed that it was the
         tremendous rise in the cost of transportation. Virginia, he
         claimed, had almost no home market. Over 80% of its normal
         production was shipped out to other states. The failure of
         the Interstate Commerce Commission to treat Virginia
         furnaces as southern furnaces was the cause of much of the
         trouble. From 1914-1925 there were four blanket increases
         in freight rates in the country, of which only one applied
         equally to all localities. Southern furnaces were received
         only two increases--a 25% increase in 1918 and a 25%
         increase in 1920--but northern furnaces had had 5%, 15%,
         25%, and 40% increases in their transportation costs.
         Virginia furnaces, although recognized as southern
         furnaces, had had freight rates increased in line with the
         northern furnaces. Prior to the war Virginia iron reached
         all points in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois on a
         competitive basis with southern furnaces. After World War I
         the advantage was limited to a small portion of
         southeastern Ohio. All of Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan
         were now lost to the Virginia producers. The Virginia
         producer, according to Bertie, felt that the freight rates
         should be restored to a relationship with southern
         furnaces. If what Bertie said was true, the other southern
         states iron industries should not have been in the same
         desperate economic straits as Virginia's, and statistics
         should support this. In the 1920's production rose to new
         heights in Alabama. In Tennessee, however, iron production
         plunged to new lows during the 1920's. While the south
         accounted for 10.2% of the entire U. S. production in the
         years 1919-1924, Virginia accounted for less than 1% during
         those years. In 1915 Virginia accounted for over 6% of the
         U.S. iron production. One can see a decline in other areas
         of the south than Virginia. While the discrepancies in the
         freight rates may have helped cause the decline, clearly
         there are other reasons.</p>
      <p>During the 1900's there was a discovery of extremely
         rich iron ore deposits in the mid-west. Much of this ore
         was on or near the surface, making the mining of it both
         easy and inexpensive. This in turn lowered production costs
         of the pig iron. This caused iron production to shift to
         that region, and resulted in a decline in the Virginia iron
         industry. There was a sharp increase in iron production in
         the mid-west through the 1920's. The iron ore in the
         mid-west may have been of better quality than Virginia, but
         the iron ore in Virginia was of sufficient quality to
         produce a good pig iron. The western ore deposits were not
         as conveniently located as Virginia deposits, but the
         inexpensiveness of production more than made up for it.</p>
      <p>In examining the rise and fall of the Low Moor Iron
         Company, we can see a situation in which the conditions for
         the manufacture of iron were nearly ideal. There was plenty
         of land for expansion and resources for the manufacture of
         the iron. The major internal problem faced by the Low Moor
         Iron Company was that of transportation. External
         developments, however, caused the final demise of the Low
         Moor Iron Company.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Low Moor Iron Company papers consist of
         approximately 280 four-inch Hollinger archives boxes (ca.
         95 linear feet) of records, ca. 1885-1927, and some 1200
         bound volumes of the company's accounting records,
         1873-1927, of this iron producing company located in Low
         Moor (four miles southwest of Clifton Forge), Alleghany
         County, Virginia.</p>
      <p>This material consists of records typical of those
         produced by a firm of this type in the period, but as the
         company owned its own coal and iron mines and limestone
         quarries, there is considerable information about the
         production of these raw materials. Large numbers of the
         records that deal with the company's employees have
         survived: time books, payroll books, hands ledgers, and the
         like. Because these books sometimes include information
         about the employee's trade or job with the company, and as
         race is indicated in some of the records, these books
         should provide date for studies of the structure and upward
         mobility within the labor force, patterns of
         ethnic--possibly racial--occupational penetration and
         mobility, material conditions of the workers, and so on.
         The papers should permit a range of studies detailing the
         pattern and evolution of industrial organization in the
         iron industry, and the evolution of markets and marketing
         structures for the entire period. Because the company was
         dependent upon railroads to move its raw materials to the
         furnaces, and for the marketing of its products, there is
         considerable information about railroads and their
         relationship to their customers.</p>

      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>The word "organization" is used here with considerable
         diffidence, for any researcher studying the container list
         that follows will realize quickly that there is no
         organization in the usual sense of the word.</p>
      <p>As noted under "Provenance," the Low Moor Iron Company
         papers were subjected to a number of moves; when processing
         began in the fall of 1976, no discernible scheme of
         organization could be determined.</p>
      <p>The first step was to review the series of coded numbers
         placed on the bundles of papers before they were moved to
         the dormitory attic, but these did not provide any sort of
         useful organization. Next, the spine titles of the original
         letter boxes were reviewed (they had been copied onto the
         gray cardboard sheets before the move to the dormitory
         attic), but they, too, proved useless.</p>
      <p>These steps having provided no scheme, and after a
         considerable hiatus due to a turnover in student processors
         on the collection, the new student processors were
         instructed to begin a box-by-box inventory of the contents
         of the collection. During this inventory, old folders were
         replaced with acid-free ones, and the original folder
         headings were copied onto the new ones. Some removal of
         paper clips was accomplished, and the materials were
         reviewed and notes taken for the guide.</p>
      <p>Some consolidation of materials was accomplished, and in
         other cases, materials were moved. This work has created
         some problems in the numbering of the boxes. Thus, the
         researchers will find boxes marked "6A" and "23C"; he will
         also discover that certain box numbers have been entirely
         omitted. As the box numbers exist only to aid in the
         location of material, it was not felt that the unusual
         numbers and the omissions would cause problems in working
         with the papers.</p>
      <p>A certain amount of movement of boxes within the
         collection, and of materials among boxes, probably would
         ease use of it. But what processing was accomplished on
         this project took far longer than had been anticipated, and
         there was no time in the late spring of 1978, when the
         processors had to complete their work with the project, to
         undertake a mass movement of material. Thus, they stand in
         the order in which we found them at the beginning of the
         project.</p>

        <head>Other Finding Aid</head>
        <p>Some 1200 bound accounting record books of the Low Moor
            Iron Company came into the custody of the Library with the
            loose papers. When the project staff investigated these
            volumes in the dormitory attic where they were stored, they
            found that the volumes had been shelved by size rather than
            by series. Thus, a letterbook may stand next to a stock
            report book for a furnace, which is, in turn, next to a
            store account book for the Kay Moor Mines' store. No series
            are shelved in order.</p>
        <p>Members of the project staff surveyed the volumes,
            completing for each volume two copies of a mimeographed
            survey form, and assigning to each volume a number. One
            copy of the survey report form was placed in the volume,
            and the second was returned to the Library.</p>
        <p>From the survey report forms, 3 x 5 inch index
            cards--with a carbon copy of each--were typed. One set of
            index cards has been kept in order by the numbers assigned
            to the volumes as they stand on the shelves. This provides
            a shelf list for the use of the library staff. The other
            set of cards was sorted into categories as a finding aid.
            On the list that follows, the researcher will find a number
            of major headings such as "Accounts," "Inventories,"
            "Letter Books," and "Shipments-Outgoing."</p>
        <p>Insofar as it has been possible to determine from the
            data on the survey report forms, the volumes have been
            assigned to categories. Most of the major categories, or
            headings, have sub-headings. Within those sub-headings, the
            volumes have been arranged chronologically. The
            investigators realize that after careful study of some of
            these volumes, they will be revealed as belonging to other
            categories than those in which they have initially been
            placed. The card index will allow such movement.</p>
        <p>Available in the Manuscripts/Archives Reading Room in
            the Library is the sorted card index file. There is a card
            for every volume in this file whereas, on the pages that
            follow, volumes have been summarized under the headings and
            sub-headings. In each case, the number of volumes has been
            given in the summarized list; the date ranges given are
            inclusive in most cases, and do not reveal the many gaps in
            sequences unless the number of volumes is small and the
            date range wide. Occasional remarks about the content of
            volumes have been supplied if the contents are not obvious
            from the heading or sub-heading.</p>
        <p>Researchers wishing to examine any of these volumes will
            have to use the card index file in order to be able to give
            to the staff the volume number assigned to the individual
            volumes that are to be inspected.</p>
