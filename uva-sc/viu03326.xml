      <p>The Thompson Family papers include the correspondence,
         manuscripts, and financial papers of John P. Thompson, Sr.
         (dates unknown), a Confederate officer and Democratic
         politician, his wife Neilia Cave Thompson (dates unknown),
         their son John P. Thompson, Jr. (1967-1945), and his wife
         Florence Kemper Thompson (1859-1944), daughter of Confederate
         general and Virginia governor James Lawson Kemper.</p>
      <p>The correspondence series, dating from 1862 to 1918,
         consists of personal and financial correspondence. John P.
         Thompson, Sr., a native of Owensboro, Kentucky, joined the
         Confederate army in 1861 and was commissioned a Captain
         commanding Company G, 1st Kentucky Cavalry. He went with his
         regiment to Manassas Junction, Virginia to join Confederate
         forces there under Joseph E. Johnston. When Union troops under
         Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant seized Paducah, Kentucky,
         to counter a Confederate thrust into the then-neutral Blue
         Grass state, Thompson and his company petitioned Confederate
         president Jefferson Davis to let them return to defend their
         native state. Davis refused their petition, claiming that
         Confederate forces in Virginia were too small to allow a
         further reduction of strength. After a year's service in the
         Eastern theater, Thompson was promoted to Major and sent home
         to Kentucky in 1863 to recruit new members for the regiment.
         He was captured behind enemy lines at Owensboro and sentenced
         to be shot as a spy, but Confederate authorities intervened
         and got the sentence reduced to imprisonment at Johnson's
         Island, Sanduscky, Ohio, where he remained until the close of
         the war. While in prison he corresponded with Neilia Cave of
         Orange, Virginia, a girl he had met while stationed there with
         his regiment. Thompson returned to Orange, and married Neilia;
         their son, also named John P. Thompson, was born in 1867. The
         elder Thompson returned to Kentucky to engage in politics on
         the Democratic side. His letters to his wife discuss his
         political activities. He seems to have passed away in the
         later 1870's.</p>
      <p>Most of the correspondence between 1870 and 1918 concerns
         the younger John P. Thompson, his mother, and his wife,
         Florence Kemper Thompson. The letters trace Thompson's early
         wide-ranging attempts to establish himself in business and his
         search for a bride in places ranging from San Francisco to New
         York City. In 1899 Thompson married Florence Kemper, owner of
         "Walnut Hills" in Orange County, Virginia. She had inherited
         this small estate of her father, Confederate general and
         Virginia governor James L. Kemper, upon his death in 1895. The
         couple remained childless. The remaining correspondence
         concerns Thompson's efforts to change "Walnut Hills" from a
         simple home into a summer resort and develop the farming
         business by expanding into raising bulls and steers. Much of
         the correspondence is personal correspondence between the
         Thompsons and the widowed Mrs. Thompson, who had moved with
         Leslie H. Gray to Brooklyn, New York. These letters describe
         and contrast city life in New York at the turn of the century,
         including famous city personages such as Frederick Dent Grant,
         eldest son of Ulysses S. Grant, with Southern rural society
         with its traditions and memories of the Lost Cause. The
         Thompsons sold "Walnut Hills" around 1930. Florence Thomspon
         died in 1944, her husband died a year later.</p>
      <p>The manuscript series dating from 1884 to 1911 includes
         several memorandum books kept by the Thompsons recording
         letters mailed and attendance at local dances. There are some
         recollections of Neilia Cave Thompson about life in Civil War
         Virginia, several unsigned stories, and a few humorous
         political anecdotes.</p>
      <p>The financial papers, spanning the years 1860 to 1918,
         regard the younger Thompson's business transactions in
         attempting to develop his farm. Other financial papers concern
         "Walnut Hills," including guest lists and typewritten drafts
         of descriptive brochures, and Thompson's bulls.</p>
      <p>The printed material series, from 1898 to 1928, consists
         mainly of advertisements for farm machinery and fashions.
         There are several medical periodicals, a play program, and
         postcards and printed brochures about "Walnut Hills." Several
         unidentified photographs are located at the end of the
         collection.</p>
