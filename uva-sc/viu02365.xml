      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 98 items, 1784-1870,
         chiefly autograph letters and documents pertaining to the
         settlement of the estate of George Washington and the business
         concerns of the Washington family. Most of the correspondence
         is addressed to Bushrod Washington and Lawrence Lewis,
         executors of George Washington's estate. Other letters and
         business papers are concerned with the Washington family, the
         Dismal Swamp Land Company, and Virginia politics.</p>
      <p>Legal and financial papers consist of accounts,
         inventories, powers of attorney, rents due, receipts, deeds,
         and bills, and include: a list of the rents due General
         Washington by his tennants in Loudoun, Fauquier, and Berkeley
         Counties (1784-1785); an inventory of the sale of horses
         (1797); an account with the physicians, Dr. Dangerfield and
         Dr. Thornton (1813, 1814, &amp; 1818); a military land grant
         to George Lewis (1821); the case of Michael Cresap vs.
         Archibald McClean (1823 Jul) and an estimate of the property
         belonging to the estate of George Washington unsold by the
         executors (ca. 1800). Also present is an autograph of George
         Washington Parke Custis (1857 Jul 13). A helpful reference
         work pertaining to this collection is

          <p>He furnishes a detailed report concerning the Kanawha
               lands belonging to George Washington located in Wood,
               Kanawha, and Ohio Counties [present-day West Virginia],
               including the Round Bottom and Burning Spring tracts. He
               asks whether Lewis wants him to continue renting the
               lands and to settle a dispute with Sheriff Alderson over
               his collection of back taxes on Washington's property.
               Lewis also describes the damage done to the Mill Creek
               Settlement by settlers who cut down the sugar trees, and
               mentions the controversy over the Kanawha lands with
               James Welch, who had leased some of the lands from
               Washington.</p>

               Suffolk, he was not able to get a good price. He had
