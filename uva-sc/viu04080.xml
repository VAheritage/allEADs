            <p>The correspondence of Joseph C. Cabell, ca. 280 items (1 Hollinger box, .5 linear
                feet), ca. 1807-1856, deals chiefly with family news and business matters
                including topics such as improvements to "Edgewood" (Dr. George Cabell, Jr., March
                4, 1811); Samuel Cabell at the College of William and Mary (October 11 and November
                28, 1807), medical advice from Dr. George Cabell (November 13 and 30, 1814), and the
                weights of the hogs belonging to the "Negroes' from "Belmont" (William N. Dixon,
                December 21, 1850). Correspondents include Dr. John Grattan Cabell, Henry Coalter
                Cabell, Mayo Cabell, Andrew Duncan, David S. G. Cabell, Colonel William Cabell, Dr.
                George Cabell, Jr. and James Bruce McClelland. Many letters deal with business
                concerns, the manufacture and procurement of equipment for Cabell, recommendation of
                workers and overseers, crops, Cabell's flour mill, and land sales. There also
                present are some purely financial and legal documents and these have been filed
                under the pertinent name.</p>

            <p>The collection is arranged by name of correspondent, with those containing few items
                placed in miscellaneous correspondent folders together. Often these have only one or
                two items per name, so the dates for these correspondents are not mentioned
                separately in the guide.</p>
