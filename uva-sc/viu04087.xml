      <p>Armistead Churchill Gordon, Jr. (1897-1953) was a professor of English
                Literature at the University of Virginia from 1919 to 1953. He married Cornelia
                Waddell and they had a daughter Ann Gordon (1929-1994), who became the main
                connection between the Gordon and Webster families through her marriage to Richard
                Henry "Harry" Webster (1924-2007). Armistead Churchill Gordon, Jr. was born
                in Staunton, Virginia to Armistead Churchill Gordon, Sr. (1855-1931) and
                Maria Breckinridge Catlett Gordon (?-1930). Armistead Churchill Gordon, Sr. was the
                son of George Loyall Gordon (1829-1862) who died at Malvern Hill during the
                Civil War and was grandson of the politician, William Fitzhugh Gordon
                (1787-1858).</p>
      <p>Armistead Churchill Gordon, Sr. was an attorney and a writer; graduated from the
                University of Virginia and William and Mary Law School; practiced law in Staunton,
                Virginia; was mayor of that city for two years and served as Commonwealth Attorney.
                He was a member of the Board of Visitors at the University of Virginia for sixteen
                years; was rector of the University of Virginia (1897-1898; 1906-1918)
                and was president of the Virginia State Bar Association. In addition to Armistead
                Churchill Gordon, Jr., he had two other sons, James Lindsay Gordon
                (1895-1969) and George Loyal l Gordon, (1899-1918) and two daughters,
                Mary Daniels Gordon, (1893-1980] and Margaret Douglas Gordon
                [1891-1930's].</p>
      <p>Armistead Churchill Gordon, Jr. graduated from William and Mary College and entered
                military service in World War I at Camp Lee with his younger brother, George Loyall
                Gordon. Armistead was transferred to the Casual Department and the Gas and War
                defense. After the war, he received a scholarship to study and teach at the
                University of Virginia in 1919. He then, married Cornelia Waddell in 1922 and Ann
                Gordon was born in 1929. After teaching for many years at the University of
                Virginia, he was called into service during World War II as a Lieutenant General.
                After several weeks of training at Cambridge, Massachusetts, he was stationed in
                Washington D. C. Cornelia joined him in an apartment in the city and Ann Gordon was
                sent to board at St. Anne's Belfield School in Charlottesville, Virginia during the
                remaining years of the war.</p>
      <p>Armistead's brother, James Lindsay Gordon (1895-1969) attended the University
                of Virginia and served in World War I on the U.S.S. Rijnland that went overseas. He
                wrote stories when he was younger and had some of them published along with
                illustrations from his sister, Mary. After the war, James worked full time at the
                Roanoke Valley and Tie Company in Lexington, North Carolina, and eventually bought
                the company in 1926. After the depression, he became the City Manager for Lexington,
                and eventually opened another business, Gordon Veneer Company. He was very outgoing
                and popular in Lexington. He married Adelaide Thompson Hargrave and they had two
                daughters, Mary Lindsay Gordon and Adelaide Hargrave Gordon. He wrote letters to his
                sister, Mary and brother, Armistead but was unable to visit often. Their family
                stayed in Lexington, North Carolina.</p>
      <p>George Loyall Gordon,(1899-1918) named after his grandfather who died at
                Malvern Hill, attended William and Mary and died of sickness [tetanus] during World
                War I.</p>
      <p>Mary Daniels Gordon was a writer and illustrator, and travelled with her father,
                Armistead Churchill Gordon, Sr. to New York to meet with publishers about her
                literary work. Some of her illustrations and stories were published. ("The Chrystal
                Ball," <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Little Brown Publishers</title>, and <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Corks and Curls</title>) She was unmarried and took care of her
                father until he passed away in 1931. She later moved to Ridgeway Farm in
                Charlottesville, Virginia, and leased the family house in Staunton.</p>
      <p>Armistead's sister, Margaret Douglas Gordon suffered from "nerves" and was admitted
                to Western State Hospital in Staunton, Virginia in 1917. She later became ill with
                tuberculosis in 1931, while still at the institution.</p>
      <p>Ann Gordon Webster (1929-1994) was the only child of Armistead and Cornelia
                Gordon. She attended Stonefield School, St. Anne's Belfield School, and Wellesley
                College. Her husband, Harry Webster (1924-2007) was a graduate of Moses Brown
                School, Princeton University and attended Harvard Law School. Harry temporarily left
                Princeton to serve in World War II where he was stationed in Texas, Oklahoma,
                Hawaii, and Japan. He began his service as a Private and moved up to Corporal and
                then Sergeant in the medical corps (as an anesthetist, although he had no interest
                in becoming a doctor). (See Series II: William Webster: Box: 12 Letters to Edward
                and Alice Blodgett).</p>
      <p>Harry and Ann were married in 1949 while she finished her last year of school at
                Wellesley and he accepted a job in the Foreign Service. He worked for the Central
                Intelligence Agency and served tours in Madrid; London; Salisbury, Rhodesia; The
                Hague, and traveled widely in Europe and Latin America. He retired from the Foreign
                Service in 1973. After retirement Harry continued to travel to his favorite places
                such as Europe, Costa Rico and his family vacation home in Weld, Maine.</p>
      <p>Harry Webster was the son of atomic energy expert, William Webster (1900-1972)
                and Eleanore Blodgett Webster (?-1961). Eleanore was the daughter of Judge Edward
                "Peter" Blodgett and Alice Foster Blodgett. William "Bill" or "K" Webster graduated
                from the Naval Academy in 1920 and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
                1923. He served in the United States Navy as a Naval Constructor and an officer in
                the Construction Corps until 1928. He then worked for the New England Electric
                System in 1928 beginning as an assistant to the general manager and was promoted to
                vice president in 1942; director in 1950, president in 1959, chief executive officer
                in 1963, and retired from NEPA in 1970. He was credited with finding peaceful uses
                for atomic energy, and bringing atomic electric power to New England. He was widely
                known as the architect of Yankee Atomic Electric Company, and formed ten New England
                Electric Companies to produce one nuclear power plant.</p>
      <p>He also held a number of important government positions, including the chairmanship
                of the Research and Development Board in the Department of Defense under President
                Harry S. Truman. One of his charges was to assess the effectiveness of the Hydrogen
                bomb. He also served in the Office of Scientific Research and Development from 1943
                to 1946; was deputy for atomic energy to the Secretary of Defense in 1948; and
                chairman of the Military Liaison Committee to the Atomic Energy commission in 1951.
                He was a member and officer of many organizations including the National Advisory
                Committee for Aeronautics; the Presidents Scientific Advisory Committee; the Army
                Scientific Advisory Panel; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; AETNA Life
                Insurance Company; Federal Reserve Bank of Boston; the Woods Hole Oceanographic
                Institution; the Huyck Corporation; and chairman of the Rand Corporation. After
                years of working in the Electric Power industry and serving the government and his
                country, he received many awards including, the John Fritz Medal of the American
                Institute of Electrical Engineers. This award recognized him for notable scientific
                and industrial achievement, specifically leadership in developing peaceful uses of
                atomic energy. Although he still held many of these titles, he became ill in 1971
                and died in 1972.</p>
      <p>William Webster was the son of Richard Henry Webster and Harriet Archer Williams.
                William's mother was the daughter of Stevenson Archer Williams, a well known
                attorney in Bel Air, Maryland.</p>
      <p>William Webster was the son of Richard Henry Webster and Harriet Archer Williams.
                William's mother was the daughter of Stevenson Archer Williams, a well known
                attorney in Bel Air, Maryland.</p>
      <p>William's mother and father "parted company" in 1920 (but never divorced). His mother
                was a housemother for Oldfields school in Baltimore, Maryland. His father held a job
                as a bank teller for a short time, had a tomato canning business, was often broke,
                and had problems with alcohol. William financially supported both of his parents and
                several family members.</p>
      <p>William Webster had a brother, Stevenson "Steve" Williams Webster (1903-1990),
                who became the headmaster of several schools including Saint James School. He
                attended the University of Virginia and developed a friendship with the Gordon
                family starting in the 1920's. He was very witty, loved to tell stories, and while
                he was very outgoing, he also enjoyed a quiet life of solitude and love of nature.
                He was responsible for introducing Harry Webster to Ann Gordon.</p>
      <p>In addition to his brother, William also had two sisters, Anna ("Nan") Stump Webster
                Wolff and Ariel Hope ("Hope") Harlan. Hope and her husband Herbert Harlan had one
                daughter, Hope who married William Dallam. They had four children, Katie, William,
                Ariel, and David. Nan and her husband Miles Wolff (writer and Managing Editor of
                    <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Evening Sun</title> and Executive Director of the

                ("Lila") McCormick Wolff, Anna Wolff Dixon, Jr. and one son, Miles ("Bee") Hoffman
                Wolff, Jr.</p>
      <p>In 1961, William Webster's wife, ("Roo") was tragically killed in an automobile crash
                while on a trip with him in North Carolina. The car accident resulted in a lawsuit
                against the Webster estate and William settled out of court the following year. Also
                in 1961 Harry Webster ("Tig") was assigned to Salisbury, Rhodesia. Harry left for
                his assignment, and Ann Gordon and the children stayed with William in Washington,
                D.C. to help him recover from his injuries and the devastating loss of his wife. In
                1963, William married his secretary, Miss Vollie Sanderson, who worked for the New
                England Power Association and had handled the business and affairs of the Webster
                family for many years. The Webster family used nicknames from Winnie the Pooh
                characters, William was referred to as "K" for Kanga, Eleanore as "Roo," and Harry,
                as "Tigger" or "Tig."Harry and Ann Gordon Webster had four children, William
                ("Barney") Webster (1951-present,) Elizabeth ("Liza") Webster (1955-present,)
                Armistead ("Oppit") Webster (1957-present,) and Margaret ("Maggie") Webster

                Jr.'s dissertation in 1923, "Fugitive Verses of Virginia Writers." (Series I:
                Armistead Churchill Gordon, Jr.: General correspondence Box: 2)</p>
      <p>The collection also has correspondence that mentions University of Virginia faculty
                and members of the Charlottesville community, including Atcheson and Virginia Hench,
                Carl and Margaret Speidel, William and Elizabeth Weedon, George and Virginia Zehmer,
                Frank and Jeanette Geldard, James and Betty Kindred; William Cabell Bruce, Phillip
                Bruce, Philippa Bruce, Art Shepperson, John Luck, Edward Younger, Dr. Paul and Anna
                Barringer, and Colgate Darden. The correspondence mostly mentions daily activities
                of the faculty and their families such as travel, general health, bridge, tennis,
                and social engagements. (Series I: Armistead Churchill Gordon: Gordon family
                correspondence Boxes: 3-7; and Series III: Ann Gordon Webster: family correspondence
                Boxes: 13-17).</p>
      <p>Included in the general correspondence are letters from John Cooke Wyllie and James
                Southall Wilson. There are letters from and about John Armstrong Chaloner, a famous
                and eccentric member of the Astor family of New York, who lived at Merrie Mills,
                Cobham, Virginia and was a friend of the Gordon family. (Series: 1 Armistead
                Churchill Gordon: general correspondence: Box: 2 and Gordon family correspondence
                Boxes: 3-7)</p>
      <p>The family correspondence is from 1914 to 1931 and includes Armistead Gordon, Jr. and
                his siblings, James Lindsay Gordon, George Loyall Gordon, Mary Daniels Gordon,
                Margaret Douglas Gordon, and their parents, Armistead Churchill Gordon, Sr., and
                Maria ("Ria") Breckinridge Catlett Gordon of Staunton, Virginia. The letters
                describe college life at William and Mary and the University of Virginia in 1917 as
                well as military service during World War I. (Series I: Armistead Churchill Gordon:
                Gordon family correspondence Boxes: 4-8) Armistead's youngest brother, George Loyall
                Gordon died from an illness (tetanus from contact with a rusty nail?) during the
                war. In 1918 Armistead's sister, Margaret Gordon, was sent to Western State Hospital
                in Staunton, Virginia where Dr. Joseph DeJarnette diagnosed her with tuberculosis in
                1931. There is very little mention of Margaret but there is a letter in which she
                wrote to her father pleading with him to let her return home. Her later letters seem
                to suggest that she didn't mind staying there and that the hospital was a nice
                retreat and the people were very pleasant. (Series I: Armistead Churchill Gordon,
                Jr. Gordon family correspondence: Box: 5)</p>
      <p>There are minutes of the Board of Visitors from 1931 to 1936 with notes by Armistead
                Churchill Gordon, Sr. and a dedication to James Southall Wilson and Wilson Hall by
                Fredson Bowers. (Series I: Armistead Churchill Gordon, Jr.: University of Virginia
                Box: 9) There is also a proposal to move the medical school to Richmond, Virginia
                (Series I: Armistead Churchill Gordon: Gordon family correspondence Box: 6)</p>
      <p>There is early correspondence of the Webster family in which Harry Webster wrote
                letters to his grandparents, Peter and Alice Blodgett describing his daily life in
                the service in World War II in Texas, Oklahoma, Hawaii, and Japan. (Series II
                William Webster: Box: 12).</p>
      <p>The correspondence of William and Harry Webster includes letters from government
                officials such as Robert Ellison; William T. Golden; Robert Cutler; William
                Spraque; David E. Lilienthal,Chairman U. S. Atomic Energy Commission; James
                Forrestal, Secretary of Defense; J. E. Hull, Lieutenant General, Office of the

                Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Harry S. Truman. J. Robert
                Oppenheimer is mentioned by name but no detailed information about him is included
                in the collection.</p>
      <p>There are reports from the Research and Development Board of the United States
                Defense Department which was sometimes referred to as the "Gaither's Committee."
                There are secret reports regarding the Atomic Energy Commission and National
                Security Council (Series II: William Webster Box: 10)</p>
      <p>There is also genealogical information about both the Gordon and Webster families,
                including a will for James Lindsay in 1782 in which he specified the sale of his
                slaves. (Series I: Armistead Churchill Gordon: Genealogy: Coleman) In the Webster
                family, there is genealogical information about William Webster's grandfather,
                Stevenson Archer Williams, a successful attorney in Bel Air, Maryland from
                1851-1932. (Series II: William Webster: Box: 12)</p>
      <p>There is also a court transcript of a lawsuit against William Webster in which his
                wife, Eleanore Blodgett Webster was the driver in a car accident that killed her and
                several individuals from another car. (Series II: William Webster: Box: 12)</p>
      <p>There are miscellaneous news clippings about Theodore Roosevelt, American politics,
                and the CIA in Series IV Webster family (Harry and Ann) Box: 37.</p>
      <p>  The Webster family letters include letters from William Webster and his son, Harry Webster, as well as letters
                from other close family members such as William's brother Stevenson Williams
                Webster. The letters between William Webster and Harry Webster reveal only vague
                sketches of their work such as names of conferences, travel dates, court hearings,
                government officials, and colleagues, but they do allude to important people and
                events. There are letters from Ann Webster
                to Harry Webster referring to the danger in Santo Domingo in 1965.</p>
      <p>The collection also includes information and correspondence with Harry and Ann Gordon
                Webster 's four children, William ("Barney") Webster, Elizabeth ("Liza") Webster,
                Armistead ("Oppit") Webster, and Margaret ("Maggie") Webster McManus and their
                children (Harry and Ann's grandchildren). There are also letters from various
                uncles, aunts, cousins, nieces and nephews of the Webster and Gordon families.</p>

                                English Department at Virginia Tech paying twelve hundred dollars
                                per year. There are also letters about renting the Gordon home. Some
                                of the correspondents include H. A. Watt; Charles Gordon; Frances

                                mentioned his lawsuit being almost over so that he could focus on
                                writing romances and reading his manuscripts to the Gordon's.</p>

                                summer. Correspondence shows that Gordon received a Cary Isaac
                                scholarship for his next session of school. James was working for
                                the tie company in Washington D. C. and mentioned various topics
                                such as “suffragettes,” and Union strikes. Margaret wrote about

                                to be drafted for the war. Mary wrote Armistead teasing him about
                                girls and sleeping late and George wrote about his life at home as a
                                “worm” and all the trouble everyone gave him about his chores. </p>

              <p>Armistead was working with Dr. Metcalf on the “Library of Southern
                                Literature.” Armistead Churchill Gordon, Sr. had “Gordon McCabe”
                                published. He also mentioned his work on “Allegra.”Armistead wrote
                                to his father about Dumas Malone’s negative review of “Gordon
                                McCabe” and mentioned that Dr. James Southall Wilson should have let
                                Dr. Bruce write the review instead of Malone. Also mentioned are
                                Reddy Echols, and Ivey Lewis. Armistead wrote his mother that he got
                                a raise in salary to twenty five hundred dollars per year.
                                Armistead’s father mentioned a ceremony at Monticello honoring
                                [Claude G.] Bowers with the Jefferson medal and remarked that Dr.
                                Philip Bruce’s “History of the University” was more deserving of the
                                award. Armistead’s father complained that the University of Virginia
                                was not committed to the needs of the library. James Gordon bought
                                out the Valley Tie &amp; Lumber Company in Lexington, North
                                Carolina.</p>

              <p>Armistead wrote that he was very busy with teaching at UVA and
                                extension courses in Richmond, and that it took from twelve to
                                fourteen hours a day to prepare for lectures. He continued to send
                                his biographical sketches to his father for suggestions. Ann Gordon
                                was born in May. Armistead Churchill Gordon, Sr. was working on a
                                biography of George Mason. The health of Dr. Philip Bruce was
                                mentioned, as was a visit from Mr. and Mrs. James Alston Cabell, and
                                the suicide of Bruce Williams.</p>

              <p> Armistead received sympathy from Dr. Paul and Anna Barringer, Dr.
                                Metcalf, Ivey Lewis, Albert Balz and many others regarding his
                                mother’s death. (March 11, 1930) Armistead mentioned John Cook
                                Wyllie and his research of the Staunton River and how Staunton got
                                its name from William Byrd. Armistead Churchill Gordon, Sr. finished
                                his book on the Shenandoah Valley and was starting “The Red Hills of
                                Piedmont.” Armistead wrote that Nell Lewis had been very ill but had
                                improved. Gordon, Sr. wrote about the rumors that Fred Scott was
                                named Rector of the University because he was giving the money for
                                the athletic field. He also mentioned Edwin Anderson Alderman,
                                Founders Day and needing money for the library. There were student
                                riots against the prices of the movie theaters. Mrs Paul Goodloe
                                McIntire told Armistead that they made three thousand dollars on the
                                Garden Club of Virginia’s book on historic Virginia gardens. Also
                                included is a description of Dr. Barringer; comments about the
                                Hoover economy and a news clipping about the library receiving money
                                for Virginian materials.</p>

              <p> Armistead wrote that he had been given the assignment to write a
                                biography of the Reverend John William Jones. He also mentioned
                                meeting Fred Scott and wrote criticisms of Scott for donating to
                                athletics instead of the library. He also described his theory that
                                Jefferson substituted tobacco leaves for classical acanthus on the
                                capitals of the columns of the Rotunda but it turned out to be
                                untrue. (Also mentioned are the Board Meeting Minutes of the
                                University of Virginia on the restoration of the Rotunda June 18,
                                1902) Another research project that he discussed was whether it was
                                Jack Jouett Sr. or Jr. that warned Jefferson that the British were
                                coming. He also wrote to his father that Dean “Billy” Thornton was
                                having his leg amputated. James wrote about his businesses closing
                                down due to the depression (November 24, 1930) and Armistead
                                mentioned that people were knocking on his door and begging for
                                food.</p>

                                mentioned that Scott stadium was not properly braced and a section
                                of it had sunk before it had even been used. Armistead’s father
                                passed away (October?) several months after Edwin Anderson Alderman
                                (April). (Classes were suspended for Alderman’s funeral)

            <p>Cornelia's letters to Ann from 1950 to 1969 describe UVA faculty members
                            and her daily life along with advice for Ann on every subject. She often
                            enclosed news clippings of local events and advertisements of women's
                            and men's fashions and household needs of the day. Cornelia mentioned
                            the Korean War and wanted Harry to apply for officers training so that
                            he would not get drafted. She also mentioned that Al Balz and Buzzie
                            Chamberlain had been called up and she hoped that Armistead would not be
                            called for Navy reserve. Cornelia also wrote that they were very upset
                            that Frank Geldard had a heart attack.</p>

                            harmful it was to smoke. Cornelia took a job at Monticello as a tour
                            guide; and Ann was pregnant with Liza. Armistead died in 1953 (but the

                            by Nancy Hale Bowers(March 9, 1955) about desegregation and Nell Lewis.
                            Cornelia wrote about a new broadcast (and LP) by Reuben Ship that was a
                            satire on Joseph McCarthy and was very popular in the United States and
                            Britain. Cornelia mentioned Phil Williams' suicide, and that Archie Hill
                            was leaving to teach in Texas.</p>

                            boarder. She also wrote that the Geldards were going to England for work
                            with the Navy. There is a letter from Harry Clemons praising the Gordon
                            family (starting with General William Fitzhugh Gordon to George Loyall
                            Gordon, to Rector Armistead Churchill Gordon, Sr. to Armistead Churchill

                            Ambassador of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), and suggests
                            that Ellsworth was becoming out of favor with the administration.
                            William wrote that [Richard] Helms agreed that Robert Ellison could use
                            a liaison man (Harry). According to William, Ellsworth felt President
                            Nixon would support his efforts to hire Harry. William was attending and
                            testifying in SEC hearings. There is also information about stocks
