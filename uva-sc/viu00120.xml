         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>This collection consists of 96 items, covering dates 1788,
         1942-1945, and 1992, including correspondence, financial and
         legal papers, and printed material, pertaining to the 
         <famname>Friel</famname>, 
         <famname>Graham</famname>, 
         <famname>Sanders</famname>, and 
         <famname>Tate</famname>families and 
         <geogname>Wythe County, Virginia</geogname>. The letters are
         chiefly to 
         <persname>Edwin Hanson Sanders</persname>(1871-1948) and 
         <persname>Elizabeth Graham Sanders</persname>from their son 
         <persname>Friel Tate Sanders</persname>(1915-1959) while
         serving as an officer with the 
         <corpname>14th U. S. Army Air Corps</corpname>in the
         China-Burma-India theatre during World War II.</p>
         <p>On June 28, 1942, 
         <persname>Andrew Trigg Sanders</persname>(1910-1991) writes to
         his brother 
         <persname>Friel Tate Sanders</persname>from 
         <geogname>Camp Sutton, Monroe, North Carolina</geogname>,
         discussing 
         <geogname>Scott Field</geogname>and advising him on what items
         to have on hand. In October 1942, 
         <persname>Friel Tate Sanders</persname>writes from 
         <geogname>Scott Field, Illinois</geogname>while training,
         mentioning his graduation and a rehearsal show in the hanger
         given by 
         <persname>Bob Hope</persname>and his radio cast.</p>
         <p>Upon leaving 
         <geogname>Illinois</geogname>, Sanders is transferred to 
         <geogname>Miami, Florida</geogname>, where he waits for his
         orders. His letter of January 9, 1943 is written while flying
         over 
         <geogname>Brazil</geogname>and other parts of 
         <geogname>South America</geogname>. On January 12, he writes
         that he has safely landed in 
         <geogname>Africa</geogname>and relates that the nearby town is
         almost entirely native. During late January and early
         February, he writes while in 
         <geogname>India</geogname>, drawing attention to the engraving
         at the top of the stationery, explaining that it is the
         insignia of the 
         <corpname>Air Force</corpname>shoulder patch, called the
         C.B.I.--China, Burma, India. By mid-February he has crossed
         the 
         <geogname>Himalayas</geogname>and arrived in 
         <geogname>China</geogname>. On March 20, he indicates that he
         has moved to his assigned post and is living in a private home
         with three other men, and that they have a Chinese cook, a
         houseboy, and a maid. His letter of April 3 reveals that he
         has changed stations and has heard Madame Chang [sic] [ 
         <persname>Madame Chiang Kai-shek</persname>(1897-)] speak. On
         May 2, he describes an experience that he had on the way to
         his first station in 
         <geogname>China</geogname>and the transportation problems
         encountered. During July 1943, he writes about the cigarette
         shortage, and requests certain items, including a pipe, Prince
         Albert tobacco, Camel cigarettes, and candy. On August 22, he
         mentions a visit from Sargeant 
         <persname>Marion Hargrove</persname>, author of 
         <bibref>
               <title>See Here, Private Hargrove</title>
            </bibref>, seeing a Chinese circus, and 
         <persname>Pearl Buck</persname>'s recent writings. His letters
         of December 8, 1943 and January 7, 1944 refer to their social
         activities; and, the latter refers to the comic strip "Terry
         and the Pirates" based on a fighter squadron in 
         <geogname>China</geogname>.</p>
         <p>
            <persname>Friel Tate Sanders</persname>' letter of March 22,
         1944 reveals that he has met a couple of Virginians, including
         lawyer 
         <persname>Andrew Dunscomb Christian</persname>(1892-1946). On
         May 18, he writes news of some of the men there-- 
         <persname>Sue Haislip</persname>'s husband, Fred and 
         <persname>Hampton Haislip</persname>, 
         <persname>Dick Fowler</persname>, and 
         <persname>Joe Blackburn</persname>. During the summer of 1944,
         he refers to news of the war: the invasion and the bombing of 
         <geogname>Japan</geogname>by 
         <geogname>China</geogname>based B-29's and the boost in morale
         (June 19); the news from 
         <geogname>China</geogname>being bad (July 8); hearing
         broadcast of allied news and then of propaganda from 
         <geogname>Berlin</geogname>, and Japanese announcements (July
         31). On August 31, he mentions a show put on by 
         <persname>Ann Sheridan</persname>(1915-1967) and her party.
         Having sent a box of souvenirs home, he explains the items in
         his letter of September 25--black box with a chop, Theatre
         Ribbon, and chop sticks. He mentions more news of the war
         during the fall of 1944, including hitting Japan hard at 
         <geogname>Manila</geogname>(September 25); a 
         <bibref>
               <title>Life</title>
            </bibref>picture account of the ATC route to 
         <geogname>India</geogname>being the same route he took and his
         promotion to Captain (October 8); news of the raids on 
         <geogname>Formosa</geogname>and the 
         <geogname>Hong Kong</geogname>raid on shipping (October 20);
         and, the announcement that 
         <geogname>China</geogname>is now a separate theatre (November
         2). His letter of November 27 reveals that he has seen Lt. 
         <persname>Lucian Gleaves</persname>and 
         <persname>Peyton Reed</persname>from 
         <geogname>Wytheville</geogname>, that 
         <persname>A. D. Christian</persname>has returned home, and
         that there was another movie star show, this one with 
         <persname>Jinx Falkenburg</persname>(1919-) and 
         <persname>Pat O'Brien</persname>(1899-).</p>
         <p>By February 11, 1945, he is awaiting orders to go home;
         and, on March 14, he has just returned from a week at a rest
         camp while still waiting for his orders. On May 1, he writes
         from 
         <geogname>Miami, Florida</geogname>that he has heard news of
         the end of the European War, and that the men are restricted
         to the post. During the summer of 1945, he is assigned to a 
         <corpname>Tactical Air Division</corpname>at the base in 
         <geogname>Stuttgart, Arkansas</geogname>. He writes about his
         job as a cryptographic security officer dealing with codes and
         registered documents, describes 
         <geogname>Arkansas</geogname>, and mentions Barksdale base
         (June 1). On June 10, he tells of a trip to 
         <geogname>Shreveport, Louisiana</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Lafayette, Louisiana</geogname>; and, on June 26, he
         mentions a recent trip to 
         <geogname>San Bernadino, California</geogname>and his upcoming
         visit home. On July 12 and August 5, he mentions his work;
         and, on August 25, he writes of his release from the Army and
         waiting to go to the separation center. There is also a
         "Personal Affairs Statement" for 
         <persname>Friel Tate Sanders</persname>sent to his family in
         August 1945.</p>
         <p>Financial and legal papers include 
         <geogname>Montgomery County</geogname>land transactions
         between 
         <persname>Thomas Quirk</persname>and 
         <persname>Jane Quirk</persname>and

         and, the sale of Tate land at 
         <geogname>Fort Chiswell</geogname>to
