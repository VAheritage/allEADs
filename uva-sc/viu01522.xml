         <p>William H. Goodwin (1796-1864?) resided in the city of
         Richmond (Henrico County); according to the census of 1850, he
         was an unmarried fifty-four year-old native Virginian who
         owned $5,000.00 worth of real estate and listed his occupation
         as "trader." He owned thirteen slaves between the ages of two
         and forty. According to one source, Goodwin died on April 12,
         1864, and was buried at Richmond's Shockoe Hill Cemetery.

         <p>H. N. Templeman (1804-?), also a Richmond resident, is
         described in the census of 1860 as a fifty-six year-old native
         Virginian who resided in the city with his wife and children.
         Templeman listed his occupation as "Negro Trader" and owned
         six slaves between the ages one and twenty.

            <p>This item is a manuscript ledger account book,
            1849-1851, of two Richmond, Virginia, slave dealers,
            William H. Goodwin and H.N. Templeman. The volume is housed
            in a customized box with entries inink and pencil. However,
            the majority of its pages are blank.</p>
            <p>Templeman and Goodwin were based in Richmond, and their
            firm's location on the mouth of the James River made it
            ideal for the slave trade. In their account book they enter
            the date, the name of the slave bought, and sometimes the
            age and the price paid. On the right side they enter the
            date of sale, the name of the buyer and the price
            received.</p>
            <p>Typical chilling entries under the headline "A list of
            Negroes taken South by H. N. Templeman on account of
            Templeman &amp; Goodwin" reads: "Sept. 2, 1850: Betty and
            child Mary. [ages] 27 &amp; 4. [$]625.00/Oct. 8th Sold to
            J. D. Baldwin 1000.00; Caroline &amp; 2 child[ren] Geo[rge]
            &amp; Elmora. [$]800.00/Dec. 2 Sold to Mathew Tidwell
            2250.00." At intervals the amounts were totalled on each
            side and the profit divided between the two partners. On
            other pages are accounts for "Negroes swaped," or
            exchanged, for other slaves as well as the costs of
            conducting the business, cash put in, and other company
            matters. One such entry, dated November 15, 1849, reads:
            "H. N. Templeman expences to Georgia and back to Richmond
            with thirty three negroes [$]298.50" which indicates that
            Templeman and Goodwin also purchased slaves in Georgia for
            resale in Richmond.</p>
            <p>"A list of Negroes taken South by H. N. Templeman on
            account of Templeman &amp; Goodwin" indicates that in
            September 1850 Templeman procured thirty-eight slaves
            valued at $9,482.00. This trip's expenses (horses, mules,
            wagons, harnesses) totalled $1,150.00 but the firm sold
            these slaves for $12,390.00.</p>
            <p>The last pages of this volume contain entries for cash
            sent to Goodwin during October, November and December of
            1850 and January, February, April and May of 1851;
            Goodwin's 1849-1850 accounts with Templeman in addition to
            debts owed to the two men, including John Cock's debts owed
            to Templeman; and, an entry indicating the sale of a slave
            named Granville for $975.00 on January 14, 1851.</p>
            <p>Of special interest are slaves bearing surnames, and as
            this information may be of particular interest to
            African-American history and genealogical research these
            are listed below:</p>
