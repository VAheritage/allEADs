            <p>Fredson Thayer Bowers was born in New Haven, Connecticut on April 25, 1905. Although
                he was the only child of Fredson Eugene Bowers and Hattie May Quigley, he grew up
                with two half-sisters (the children of his mother's previous marriage) and a
                stepfather, Charles K. Groesbeck.</p>
            <p>Bowers entered Brown University at age 16 after graduating from New Haven General
                High School in 1921. His study interests were in English literature and music, both
                of which he pursued with vigor. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and participated
                in a variety of literary, music and student activity clubs. He edited the school
                newspaper and served on the boards of student publications. He played the Hawaiian
                guitar, the saxophone and led a jazz band. On November 11, 1924, at age 19, while
                still an undergraduate, he married Hyacinth Adeline Sutphin, a Smith College
                graduate and member of a New York Social Register family.</p>
            <p>Bowers graduated from Brown in 1925 and spent the next nine years at Harvard doing
                graduate study and raising a family. A son, Fredson, was born in 1927, a daughter,
                Joan, in 1931, and twin sons, Peter and Stephen, in 1934. Bowers taught English,
                tutored in modern languages and developed a passion for breeding, showing, judging
                and writing about Irish wolfhounds. He earned his Ph.D in February, 1934 and the
                next year went to England on scholarship.</p>
            <p>In 1936, following an episode of marital problems that had led to a divorce, Bowers
                took an instructorship at Princeton. He taught freshman English and did editing work
                on Thomas Dekker until he accepted an offer from Dean James Southall Wilson to serve
                as acting assistant professor at the University of Virginia, which remained his home
                for the rest of his life. At the University of Virginia, Bowers taught English along
                with 17th and 18th century novels and a course in introductory bibliography. In
                1942, he married Nancy Hale, and relocated with her to wartime Washington, D.C.
                where he served as a Naval Commander supervising the deciphering of enemy codes.</p>
            <p>Bowers' impressive scholarship during his early years in Charlottesville resulted in
                his recognition as a preeminent authority of bibliographical analysis. His ideas and
                methods broke new ground and challenged established principles and methods in
                descriptive bibliography and textual criticism. In this period, he inaugurated the
                publication of <title render="italic">Studies in Bibliography</title> which he
                personally edited for more than 40 years and developed into a journal of worldwide
                repute. In 1949, he published <title render="italic">Principles of Bibliographical
                    Description</title>, which became and remains a major resource in the history of
                bibliography. His prestigious lectures and the voluminous output of his published
                essays and research together with his activities on and leadership of professional
                associations marked him as a dynamic scholar in his field. As a teacher of boundless
                energy and as an active and innovative chairman and dean, Bowers built the English
                department at the University of Virginia into one of the best in the United States.
                Bowers still found time to teach summer courses at the University of Chicago and to
                pursue his hobbies: writing music reviews each week for the <title render="italic">Richmond Times- Dispatch</title> and publishing articles about his beloved
                wolfhounds and his philatelic interests.</p>
            <p>During his later career years, Bowers turned his scholarship skills in textual
                criticism to editing the works of post-medieval writers. He published dozens of
                edited volumes (60 between 1960 and his death) creating distinct expressions of
                technique and methodology that became recognized among many as the "Bowers school of
                editing." He continued producing large numbers of essays, lectures and reviews
                beyond his retirement in 1975.</p>
            <p>Throughout his notable career, Bowers was the recipient of numerous awards and
                recognitions. Among the many were honorary degrees from Clark and Brown Universities
                and the University of Chicago. He received the Gold Medal of the Bibliographical
                Society in London and his own University of Virginia recognized his many
                achievements with its highest honor, the Thomas Jefferson Award as well as two
                endowed chairs, the Alumni Professorship of English (1957-68) and the Linden Kent
                Memorial Professorship (1968-75, 1975-91 (Emeritus)). Bowers also held appointments
                to the Fulbright, Guggenheim, Rosenbach, Woodrow Wilson National and the Academy of
                Arts and Sciences fellowships. In 1974, Bowers was honored by his former Virginia
                and Chicago students at a retirement dinner and in 1985, on the occasion of his
                eightieth birthday, his colleagues organized an international conference on
                bibliography and editing in his name at the University of Virginia.</p>
            <p>Nancy Hale, whose health had been failing for several years, died in 1988 and Bowers,
                who had also begun suffering with major health problems, died a few years later on
                April 11, 1991, at age 86. Following cremation, his ashes were buried next to the
                grave of Nancy Hale at Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Boston.</p>
