         which contains a postwar photograph of him. Wagner was
         mustered into the army in August 31, 1861 and his subsequent
         military career was a series of rapid promotions: first
         sergeant, Company D, 88th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry
         January 1862; second lieutenant, 88th Pennsylvania, April
         1862; first lieutenant, 88th Pennsylvania, December 1862;

         USCT, October 1864; lieutenant colonel, 9th USCT, November
         1864. He was discharged due to Olustee battle wounds on
         December 12, 1864 and awarded the brevet rank of colonel in
         March 1865. In 1889 Wagner delivered the keynote speech for
         the dedication of the 88th Pennsylvania's Gettysburg
         monument.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection, 1861-1904, 71 items (one Hollinger box),
         consists of papers of Lieutenant Colonel George Emil Wagner 
         (1842-1904) of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, an officer
         of United States Colored Troops during the Civil War. Letters,
         military commissions, quartermaster returns, special orders
         and miscellaneous documents pertain to his career and service
         with the 88th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry and the 6th, 8th
         and 9th regiments of United States Colored Troops, chiefly
         with the 88th Pennsylvania and the 8th USCT. (The 8th was
         recruited and enrolled at Camp William Penn, Pennsylvania,
         between September 22 and December 4, 1864. From January 1864
         to November 1865 this regiment served in Florida, Virginia,
         and Texas. Wagner apparently participated in the training of
         African-American Union soldiers at Camp Penn, the site of a
         specialized facility, the "Free Military School for Applicants
         for Command of Colored Troops" [December 1863 to September
         1864] for the instruction of white Union officers designated
         for command of black troops.) However, with a few exceptions,
         there is little direct information in this collection about
         African-American soldiers.</p>

        <p>The folder Letters of George E. Wagner to Samuel
            H. Ritter (1861-1864, 1876 &amp; 1904) consists of
            letters to his Philadelphia friend Ritter: "October 14,
            1861 (with envelope), Camp Moore, Alexandria,
            Virginia"--writing as an orderly sergeant (88th

            property belonging to a brother of former Florida senator

            plagued by "a large number of drunken &amp; disorderly
            cases" and general unruliness in the camp, GEW's hopes for
            an officer's commission, a "Negro Troupe" as the only
            amusement, and a forthcoming grand ball to be attended by "professional" ladies; 
            <lb/>"February 12, 1862 (with envelope),

            newspaper office in retaliation, a dispute among the
            regiment's companies as which could have their headquarters

            Union flags at their residences and places of business; 
            <lb/>"March 25, 1862, Camp Kelly, District of
            Columbia"--scarcity of stationery had delayed his response
            to Ritter's letters, camp news, and rain every day the
            previous week; "May 24, 1862, Camp Curtin, Fredericksburg,
            Virginia"--GEW's promotion to lieutenant, passing
            references to various things (Mount Vernon, 90th
            Pennsylvania Volunteers), the resignation of Captain George
            W. Fairlamb, comments that Fredericksburg "ain't of much
            account [and] negroes are the principle population" and its
            townspeople hate Yankees, identifies the regiment as a
            member of the General James B. Rickett's brigade in General
            Edwin Ord's Division (26th and 94th New York and 88th and
            90th Pennsylvania), complains of irregular mail delivery
            and reports that the was division reviewed on the previous
            day by Abraham Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and
            General Irvin McDowell; "November 9, 1862 (with envelope),
            Warrenton, Virginia"--GEW mentions General McClellan and
            rumors of his removal from command and speculates on the
            army's decline if true, he complains about ending of draft
            in Philadelphia and criticizes draftees, describes the
            hardships of winter camp life, his expectations of
            promotion to first lieutenant due to desertion of another
            lieutenant, and requests help in obtaining a civilian job
            as "I shall probably soon leave the service."</p>
        <p>On "August 2, 1863, Rappahannock River, Virginia", GEW
            discusses the regiment's participation in the battle of
            Gettysburg where it captured the colors of two Confederate
            regiments (23rd North Carolina and 16th Alabama), a detail
            has been sent to Philadelphia to obtain conscripts to
            replenish the regiment's ranks, Captain W. H. Fairlamb
            deserted during the battle due to cowardice, discusses his plans to seek a commission in one of the
            Negro regiments being organized in Philadelphia, and
            briefly describes cavalry skirmish near Culpeper, Virginia
            [Fairfax Station; August 8, 1863]; "September 20, 1864
            (with envelope), Petersburg, Virginia"-- Confederate

            States Colored Troops], describes "hard duty" in the
            trenches, mentions the "Petersburg Express" ["The
            Dictator," a mammoth Union mortar used during the
            Petersburg siege], General Butler has promoted him to
            major, GEW's hopes Lt. Colonel Burritt will be promoted to
            colonel so that "this will make another opening" for yet
            another promotion.</p>
        <p>"December 26, 1904"-- letter from Ritter to G. Ellwood
            Wagner mentions the death of George Wagner (Ellwood's
            father) and encloses as a gift ten of Wagner's wartime
            letters (three with envelopes addressed to Ritter, 14
            October 1861, 12 February and 9 November 862) and four
            cartes-de-visites (not present). An unrelated item in this
            folder is an 1876 Pennsylvania Railroad special ticket
            number 7013 for travel from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>The folder Quartermaster Returns (1863-1864)

            Troops, at Hilton Head, South Carolina, Olustee, Florida,

            Burrows, regimental quartermaster, 8th United States

            clothing allowance form signed by sixty-six members of Camp
            A, 8th United States Colored Troops is filed in this collection's oversize
            folder.
            </p>
        <p>Items in the folder Special Orders and Medical
            Certificates (1863-1865) are primarily printed orders
            confirming Wagner's promotions, and certificates of
            disability (April 1864) or sick leave due to a gunshot
            wound in the hip during the battle of Olustee. These orders
            were issued by the Department of the South (Hilton Head,
            South Carolina) and the Department of Virginia and North
            Carolina; Wagner was granted a leave of absence in
            Philadelphia. Two 1863 printed form letters (August 25 and
            October 13) signed by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton
            notifies Wagner of his promotions to captain in the 6th and
            8th United States Colored Troops regiments. Special Orders
            No. 174 (May 11, 1864), signed by Assistant Adjutant
            General Edward D. Townshend (War Department, Washington, D.
            C.), orders Wagner to report for duty to Lieutenant Colonel
            Louis Wagner, 88th Pennsylvania, Camp William Penn,
            Philadelphia. Special Orders No. 282 (August 26, 1864),
            also signed by Townshend, relives Wagner of his Camp Penn
            duties and instructs him to rejoin his regiment; it bears
            two stamps: "Received Head Quarters Department of
            Susquehanna Aug. 29 1864" and on the reverse "Sep 5 1864."
            Special Orders No. 350 (November 14, 1864) grants Wagner
            twenty days of sick leave on account of his wounds; a
            November 16, 1864 receipt from Surgeon Nathan F. Blunt
            (11th Maine Infantry), "Base Hospital, Tenth Army Corps
            (Jones Landing, Virginia)," of Wagner's payment of seven
            dollars for room and board. An officers' hospital (Middle
            Department, Annapolis, Maryland) certificate reports Wagner
            as honorably discharged on December 14, 1864 and a Pension
            Office letter of February 24, 1865 informs him of his
            monthly pension of ten dollars.</p>
        <p>One of the most interesting folders is Recommendation
            Letters, (1864-1866) from fellow officers of black
            Union regiments in support of Wagner's brevet promotion to
            colonel. They praise his gallantry and conduct at the
            battle of Olustee, Florida and were written by Colonel
            James Shaw, Jr., 7th United States Colored Troops (January
            3, 1864); Lt. Colonel Loren Burritt, 8th United States
            Colored Troops (January 11, 1865 &amp; December 26, 1866);
            Brigadier General William Birney, 2nd Division, 25th Army
            Corps, Army of the James (January 15, 1865); Colonel George
            P. McLean, 88th Pennsylvania Infantry (December 14, 1866);
            Brevet Brigadier General Benezet Foust, assistant
            commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned
            Lands [Freedmen's Bureau], South Carolina (December 20,
            1866). There are two letters from Colonel Ulysses
            Doubleday, 45th United States Colored Troops. On December
            24, 1864 he writes: "If all our officers were like him
            [Wagner] our armies would be invincible"; on July 1, 1865
            Doubleday urges Wagner's promotion to brevet brigadier
            general. In a June 4, 1866 printed form letter U.S. Army
            Inspector General James A. Hardie informs Congressman
            Leonard Myers that Wagner has been nominated for the brevet
            rank of colonel. Of special interest is Wagner's printed
            copy (signed in blue ink by Assistant Adjutant General
            Israel R. Sealy) of General Benjamin Butler's sixteen-page
            October 11, 1864 address to the Army of the James,
            recounting its heroics, especially United States Colored
            Troops regiments. Butler praises numerous officers and
            soldiers for gallantry, medal commendations and promotion.
            Major Wagner's promotion (Third Division, Tenth Army Corps)
            to lieutenant colonel, 9th United States Colored Troops, is
            on page sixteen. Also present is a blank officer's "Oath of
            Office" form.</p>
        <p>Among the items in the folder Histories of the 8th United States
            Colored Troops are three undated autograph
            manuscripts, with corrections, presumably written by
            Wagner. These include "Eight Regiment U. S. Colored Troops"
            (8 pages in pencil) and an untitled, incomplete manuscript
            (pages 6-15, in ink) narratives of the 8th United States
            Colored Troops's service from its mustering in at Camp
            William Penn, Pennsylvania, its participation in the battle
            of Olustee, Florida, transfer to Virginia and the Army of
            the James, the battle of Fort Gilmer [Chaffin's Farm/New
            Market Heights, Virginia], the Petersburg Campaign, postwar
            service on the Texas-Mexico border, and mustering out at
            Camp Cadwalader, Pennsylvania, in December 1865. A third
            manuscript, "Some Account of the Services of the Eight
            Regt. U. S. Colored Troops/By one who served as an Officer
            with it, from its Organization to its Disbandment" (6
            pages--incomplete, in ink) is a history of the 8th ending
            with its arrival at Jacksonville, Florida, on the eve of
            the Olustee battle. The fourth item in this folder is
            "Extract of Colonel Nelson B. Bartram's speech on the
            occasion of the presentation of the 20th United States
            Colored Troops's colors by the New York Union League" in
            which Bartram praises the 8th United States Colored
            Troops's bravery at Olustee and writes in a postscript:
            "Geo[orge] I thought the above would be good to introduce
            in your history of the 8th." The last item in this folder
            is a document of twelve "Questions for Col. Wagner" (on the
            reverse of a September 7, 1877 form letter of William
            Birney, United States attorney for the District of
            Columbia); these questions pertain to the 9th United States
            Colored Troops and the battle of Fort Gilmer on September
            29, 1864. Birney inquires about his orders and actions and
            the location of Union generals David B. Birney, Benjamin F.
            Butler, Ulysses S. Grant, and James Shaw, Jr. Birney had
            become involved in controversy with Colonel James Shaw and
            Joseph M. Califf of the 7th United States Colored Troops.
            Califf was the author of 
            <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Record of the Services of the
            Seventh Regiment</title>(1878), in which he criticized
            Birney for failing to issue proper written orders during
            the regiment's recruitment, improper use of recruiting
            funds, and his faulty leadership at Fort Gilmer. An angry
            Birney accused Shaw and Califf of libeling his reputation,
            and Wagner's responses (not present) were undoubtedly used
            by Birney for his published defense 
            <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">General William Birney's Answer to
            Libels Clandestinely Circulated By James Shaw,
            Jr</title>(1878). Wagner's August 10, 1878 letter to Shaw,
            reprinted on pages 6 and 7 of Califf's November 30, 1878
            pamphlet rebuttal of Birney's accusations, 
            <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">To the Ex-Members And Friends of The

            Birney's incorrect assurances as to the security of the 8th
            Regiment's flanks, and his failure to resupply it with
            ammunition, nearly causing it to be surrounded and
            captured.</p>
        <p>The collection's Oversize folder contains Wagner's
            military commissions, 1862-1866, signed by Pennsylvania
