        <p>The collection was purchased from Miss Geraldine
            Oaksmith of New Port, North Caroline, in July 1935. Miss
            Oaksmith later withdrew ten letters written by Sarah Helen
            Whitman and sold them privately. This original
            correspondence was replaced by photostatic copies. The
            entire collection was then accessioned on December 4, 1967,
            and bears no restrictions.</p>

      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Elizabeth Oakes (Prince) Smith, author, lecturer and
         reformer, was born in North Yarmouth, Maine, in 1806. She was
         raised with strict religious discipline by her parents, David
         and Sophia (Blanchard) Prince. The family moved to Portland,
         Maine, in 1814 and there, in deference to her mother's wishes,
         Elizabeth abandoned her plan for a higher education and a
         career as a director of a school for girls and married
         newspaper editor and political satirist Seba Smith in
         1823.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth devoted the early years of their marriage to
         raising her family. Their fortune was lost when Smith fell
         victim to the land boom which culminated in the panic of 1837.
         The family moved to Charleston, South Carolina, in 1839, where
         Smith hoped to regain his losses by selling cotton cleaning
         machines to planters. This venture failed and they moved to
         New York where they lived until 1860.</p>
      <p>This move proved to be the start of Elizabeth's long and
         notable public career as a writer. To assist her husband she
         began to contribute sketches, essays, and poems to the popular
         periodicals of the day, such as 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Ladies' Companion</title>, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Southern Literary Messenger</title>, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Godey's Lady's Book</title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Graham's American Monthly
         Magazine</title>. Her poem, "The Sinless Child," (1834), drew
         wide acclaim from critics such as Edgar Allan Poe and Rufus
         Wilmot Griswold. Many of her works were penned under the
         pseudonym Ernest Helfenstein.</p>
      <p>In addition to her poetry, she wrote seven novels, had two
         of her plays produced, and authored many short stories and
         children's stories. Her writings, which often portrayed
         religious and sentimental themes, became tremendously popular;
         one novel, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Bald Eagle</title>, was a best seller
         in Beadle's dime novel series.</p>
      <p>Oakes Smith's articles in support of woman suffrage,
         written for the New York 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Tribune</title>in 1850, launched her
         successful career as a lyceum lecturer from 1851 to 1857.
         Social and moral issues dominated her public speaking. She
         argued for temperance and equal suffrage and lectured on the
         social ills of advancing capitalism and slothfulness and the
         necessity of religious faith. In 1877 she served as the
         minister of the Independent Church in Canastota, New York. She
         continued with her writing throughout her later life, adding
         such publications as 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Ladies Home Journal</title>, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Baldwin's Monthly</title>, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Cosmopolitan</title>, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Portland Transcript</title>, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Woman's Words</title>, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Truth</title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Great Republic Monthly</title>to
         the long list of journals which clamored for her
         contributions.</p>
      <p>Fourteen years her senior, Elizabeth's husband Seba Smith
         (1792-1868) was also a native of Maine. He graduated from
         Bowdoin College in 1818 and was working as assistant editor of
         the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Eastern Argus</title>, an important
         Democratic newspaper in Portland, Maine, when he wed Elizabeth
         Oakes Prince. Smith achieved notoriety by writing daily
         letters in the newspaper under the pseudonym Major Jack
         Downing, a Yankee adventurer who drew attention to current
         national events by satirically criticizing the administrations
         of President Andrew Jackson.</p>
      <p>Smith used the newspaper which he founded in 1829, Maine's
         first daily, the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Portland Courier</title>, as a vehicle
         for publishing these letters. They were first reprinted in
         Boston and later circulated throughout New England. Smith soon
         gained a national audience and in 1833 the letters were
         published in a volume entitled 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Life and Writings of Major Jack
         Downing of Downingville</title>. Smith published his second
         series of Jack Downing letters in the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Daily National
         Intelligencer</title>(Washington, D.C.) starting in 1847. They
         appeared in book from along with the best of his earlier
         letters under the title 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">My Thirty Years Out of the
         Senate</title>in 1859.</p>
      <p>Smith published articles and verse in a variety of popular
         journals of the day, most notably 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Southern Literary Messenger</title>and
         Ralph Waldo Emerson's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">United States Magazine</title>. His
         most famous works aside from the Downing letters include the
         epic verse "Powhatan" (1841) and an original mathematics
         dissertation entitled 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New Elements of Geometry</title>(1850).
         The Smiths moved to Patchogue, Long Island, in 1860 where
         Smith retired from public life.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth and Seba had four sons between 1828 and 1836. The
         children bore the name Oaksmith, a change made in the early
         years of their marriage. Appleton, their eldest son, was a
         ship broker and head of an importing house in Brussels called
         Frear Et Cie. He also served for a brief time as the United
         States foreign minister to Nicaragua. Appleton and his second
         wife, Augusta, resided with their many children in Hollywood,
         North Carolina, where Elizabeth lived much of the time after
         her husband's death in 1868.</p>
      <p>Another son, Edward, shared his parents literary interests
         and worked as a writer and drama critic of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">London Mercury</title>where he authored
         his own plays and short stories as well. Sidney, a lawyer
         given to adventure, worked as a commercial agent at
         Porte-Au-Prince, Haiti. In 1869 he was lost at sea while he
         was in command of a U.S. gun boat on a voyage to Haiti. Not
         much is known about a fourth son, Alvin, who apparently was a
         farmer in Maryland and was beset by many troubles-heavy debts,
         a sickly wife and his own lameness (Alvin Oaksmith to
         Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Nov. 14, 1893).</p>
      <p>All the sons married and letters from their many children
         appear throughout Elizabeth Oakes Smith's correspondence. The
         Oaksmith family seemed prone to misfortune and experienced an
         unusually high number of calamities and tragic deaths.
         Sidney's disappearance in the Caribbean is a prime example.
         His brother Edward was stricken with malaria in Cuba and died
         in 1865. Appleton was attacked with spears and arrows by
         Africans when his party attempted to navigate the Congo River.
         He survived the attack, but in 1879 a small boat that he was
         commanding in Beaufort Harbor near his coastal home in North
         Carolina capsized with six of his children aboard. His four
         eldest daughters drowned in this July 4th boating accident.
         Several other grandchildren died at an early age. Elizabeth
         outlived much of her family, and died on November 15, 1893 in
         North Carolina and was buried at Patchogue.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Oakes Smith collection consists of ca. 4,000 items (7
         boxes, ca. 3.5 linear shelf feet), 1823-1894, and includes
         correspondence, diaries, literary manuscripts, essays,
         lectures, and newspaper columns of Elizabeth Oakes Smith. Also
         included are letters and papers of her husband Seba Smith, her
         sons and their families, scrapbooks, journals, photographs,
         and printed items. Mrs. Oakes Smith's extensive correspondence
         (1833-1893) with many important literary figures of the day,
         combined with her succinct essays, lectures and columns on
         women's rights are the principle strengths of this collection.
         In addition, her correspondence with her children and
         grandchildren, especially her exchange with her
         daughter-in-law Augusta Oaksmith, offers a colorful portrait
         of family life in the mid-to late nineteenth century.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Oakes Smith's chief personal and literary
         correspondents included Elizabeth Bogart, D. C. Colesworthy,
         Augustus Whittemore Corliss, Thomas Amory Deblois, Mary
         Forrest (Julia Deane Freemen), Sallie Holley, C. A. Munson,
         Francis Springer, C. B. Stout and Sarah Helen Whitman. Also
         included are letters from notable publishers, poets, writers
         and editors including Edward William Bok, Epes Sargent,
         Prentice Brooks, Lydia Sigourney, William Fosdick, Oliver
         Wendell Holmes, Horace Greeley, and Edmund Clarence
         Stedman.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Oakes Smith also exchanged correspondence with
         distinguished clergymen and educators including Rev. Carroll
         Cutler, Frederic Henry Hedge and Bishop Abraham Newkirk
         Littlejohn; suffragists Elizabeth Smith Miller and Lucretia
         Mott; abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay, and P. T. Barnum. A
         complete list of her correspondents and the dates of their
         letters is located at the end of this guide. There is also a
         great deal of family correspondence, 1851-1894, chiefly
         letters of members of her son Appleton Oaksmith's family,
         Appleton's business correspondence, and Mrs. Oakes Smith's
         correspondence with her husband. Much of this correspondence
         concerns Appleton's imprisonment in 1862 on a charge of slave
         trading and Mrs. Oakes Smith's attempts to free him.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the collection, however, is comprised of Mrs.
         Oakes Smith's literary manuscripts. First known for her
         romantic verse, a number of her poems and sonnets appear in
         this collection and concern such subjects as nature,
         historical figures, and the supernatural. Her verse became
         increasingly religious as time went on and was typically
         sentimental. She was especially deft at writing poems of
         tribute to loved ones who had passed away.</p>
      <p>In addition, the collection includes four diaries,
         1857-1868, and one journal, 1877-1879, the latter primarily
         containing poems and quotations. Mrs. Oakes Smith's diary for
         1863 contains a lengthy eye witness account of the New York
         draft riots. There is a good run of sermons delivered from
         March to October 1877, and seventeen essays, chiefly
         concerning literary subjects such as books, authors, or the
         role of the poet. Also included are essays on religious
         topics, the origins of evil and the plight of women in a
         society dominated by men.</p>
      <p>The need for equality between the sexes was a constant
         theme in Mrs. Oakes Smith's writing. It is most evident here
         in her essays "History of the Amazons," "Woman the Inferior,"
         and "The First Bond," and in her lectures bearing such titles
         as "Biology and Women's Rights," "The Dignity of Labor,"
         "Margaret Fuller" (whom she greatly admired), and
         "Womanhood."</p>
      <p>There are two of Mrs. Oakes Smith's plays in the
         collection: 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Destiny</title>, a tragedy set in
         Italy, and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Roman Tribute</title>, which includes
         separate scripts for each role. There is also an incomplete
         version of her play, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Old New York</title>, which includes
         her notes. Mrs. Oakes Smith wrote short stories and novels,
         but most examples included are untitled; several deal with
         colonial Maine and the early settlers of that region.</p>
      <p>Seba Smith's correspondence, 1823-1868, consists of letters
         from publishers, mathematicians, and friends. A major
         correspondent is Samuel Elliot Coues who writes to Smith about
         his new ideas in astronomy and mathematics and thanks him for
         his constant scientific support. Another letter from author
         and playwright, Epes Sargent, congratulates Smith on his
         latest work, the poem "Powhatan."</p>
      <p>Most of Smith's correspondence, however, is with Boston
         publishing and printing firms including Lilly, Waite and Co.
         (publishers of an edition of "Major Jack Downing's" letters, a
         newspaper column written by Seba Smith); Gales and Seaton;
         Light and Morton, and English publisher, Richard Bentley.
         These letters generally consist of requests for new writings
         by Smith, reports on books or articles being published, or
         discussions of payment. Drafts of Smith's letters to these
         companies are occasionally interspersed. In one dated 1852,
         Smith asks Gales and Seaton for some help in material aid,"
         adding that he "would not require as much as the King of
         Hungary" but that "it was getting quite difficult to get
         along."</p>
      <p>Included is a letter from the famous mathematician and
         philosopher, Auguste Comte, who wrote to Smith concerning his
         own mathematical investigations and said he was looking
         forward to reading Smith's study, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New Elements of
         Geometry</title>(1850).</p>
      <p>There is little correspondence between Smith and his family
         included here. There is a letter from Appleton telling his
         father about his divorce from his first wife; also included
         are letters to both Appleton and Edward from their father
         which detail his health and work.</p>
      <p>Seba Smith's other papers consist mainly of poems, short
         stories, newspaper columns, and reviews of his books and
         lectures. Also included are manuscript volumes. One dated
         1862-1863 contains handwritten poems by Smith. Lost and
         suffering children is the theme of another collection of poems
         by Smith, entitled "Scattered Waifs of Half a Century"; it
         includes his commentary on poems by other individuals on the
         same subject. The newspaper columns consist of incomplete runs
         of Smith's "Major Jack Downing" letters and another series of
         columns where he wrote as Solomon Swop, editor of "Sol Swop's
         Column" which offered advice in a satirical vein.</p>
      <p>Included among Smith's papers was a packet of material
         labeled "These are valuable in presenting to the public the
         life of Seba Smith." This information has been filed under the
         heading "Material re 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New Elements of Geometry</title>" and
         includes correspondence regarding his book, lists of persons
         receiving an author's copy, numerous reviews and accounts of
         lectures on the book, and on mathematics in general.</p>
      <p>Critical reviews of the text appeared between 1850 and 1851
         in the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New York Tribune</title>, the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">National Intelligiencer</title>, and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Literary World</title>, among others,
         where the accuracy of Smith's findings was constantly
         discussed and often challenged. Some labeled his work
         "intellectual boldness" while others said that it clearly
         betrayed basic geometric truths. Smith lectured widely on the
         book, and newspaper reports of his public speeches are
         included.</p>
      <p>Also contained in the collection is a manuscript of his
         lecture delivered at the American Institute in New York City
         on January 21, 1851, in which Parker disagreed with Seba's
         mathematic premises.</p>
      <p>Edward and Appleton Oaksmith and Appleton's eldest daughter
         Bessie are best represented in the group of family
         manuscripts. The collection includes two books of verse by
         Appleton together with his essays, poems, and short stories.
         Edward's personal journal from 1855-1856 is also included and
         contains poetry, diary entries, and essays, many concerning
         his religious experiences. Bessie's papers include numerous
         poems and compositions on such topics as Country life, pets,
         and the proper behavior of a young girl. During 1873 she kept
         a diary which provides a good account of her family's life.
         Also of interest are two phrenological character analyses from
         1859 and 1866 prepared for Sidney Oaksmith and his French
         passport dated 1860.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains three scrapbooks which
         primarily consist of printed material concerning the Oaksmith
         family. Included are poems by various members of the family,
         articles, newspaper clippings, and obituaries. One scrapbook,
         dated 1868-1888, contains poems and essays written by Seba
         Smith, Elizabeth Oakes Smith, and Edward and Appleton
         Oaksmith, and was probably kept by Augusta Oaksmith. Also
         included are several detailed newspaper accounts of the
         drowning deaths of Appleton's four daughters. The other
         scrapbooks consist of poetry by other individuals, probably
         collected by Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>There is a great deal of printed material in this
         collection, primarily newspaper clippings concerning family
         members, biographical information on Elizabeth, miscellaneous
         poems, short stories, and articles, and several photographs
         and drawings of the Sicily Islands by a friend of Edward.</p>

        <head>Arrangement</head>
        <p>The correspondence series is arranged chronologically
            within each subdivision. An exception to this is Elizabeth
            Oakes Smith's correspondence with members of her family
            which is first divided according to correspondent.</p>
        <p>The literary manuscripts have a more complex
            arrangement. Mrs. Oakes Smith's manuscripts have been
            divided according to literary form with poems followed by
            lectures, speeches, and essays. These are arranged in
            alphabetical order by title. Following her autograph poems
            are folders of untitled poems, printed verse, and poetry
            fragments.</p>
        <p>These manuscripts are followed by sections of plays,
            short stories, novels, sermons, diaries, and journals.
            Because most of these manuscripts are untitled, they have
            been arranged chronologically. The newspaper columns by
            Elizabeth Oakes Smith come next, with the topic of the
            articles listed on the folder heading where possible.
            Within this topical arrangement the columns are organized
            chronologically. A small section of miscellaneous
            manuscripts rounds out this sub-series.</p>
        <p>Seba Smith's manuscripts are grouped in the following
            subseries: poems, short stories, material concerning his
            geometry text, and newspaper columns. The Oaksmith family
            material, which consists of literary manuscripts,
            pamphlets, notebooks, and other writings of the Oaksmith
            children and grandchildren, is arranged alphabetically by
            the name of the author.</p>
        <p>In most cases the miscellaneous literary manuscripts are
            undated and bear no author identification. There is a
            novella and a play followed by short stories, poems, and
            fragments of poems.</p>
        <p>The scrapbooks are arranged in chronological order and
            are followed by folders containing loose material removed
            from the books. The bulk of the printed material in Series
            IV consists of newspaper clippings. Subjects have been
            determined for some groups of clippings and the folders
            containing the topical clippings are in chronological order
            followed by folders of miscellaneous newspaper clippings.
            Photographs, drawings, circular letters, handbills, and
            other printed material are filed behind the clippings.</p>
