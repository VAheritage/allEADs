      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists of three items, a photograph and
         two letters, 1862-1863, accompanied by modern-day typescripts,
         of Merritt B. Woodruff, a member of Company H, 20th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry
         Regiment. Both letters are addressed to his sister Sarah.</p>
      <p>The regiment was organized at New Haven, Connecticut, on 8
         September 1862. It served in Pennsylvania, Virginia,
         Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina and
         participated in several of the war's major campaigns including
         Gettysburg, Chancellorsville, Resaca, the siege of Atlanta,
         and Sherman's March to the Sea. Woodruff and the 20th Regiment
         were honorably mustered out of the army in Washington, D. C.,
         on 13 June 1865.</p>
      <p>The first letter, 7 October 1862 (on stationery
         illustrating an armed farmer holding an American flag), is
         from Sergeant Merritt B. Woodruff of Watertown (enlisted
         16 August 1862) to "Dear Brother &amp; Sister Len &amp; Sarah"
         while stationed at Harper's Ferry, Virginia. Woodruff
         describes the movements of the regiment after its mustering-in
         at New Haven. It traveled by ship, rail and foot marches to
         New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D. C., where the regiment
         camped temporarily. He was not impressed by the capital
         because "While we were there we had very hard fare the most of
         the time." During its encampment at Arlington Heights the regiment, as part of
         the Army of the Potomac, was reviewed by General Silas Casey [1807-1882].</p>
      <p>Shortly thereafter the 20th Connecticut moved to Harpers Ferry and occupied Maryland Heights, the site where
         Confederate General Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson's
         [1824-1863] troops had been driven out by soldiers [during the
         battle of Antietam, 17 September 1862] under the command of
         General Ambrose P. Burnside [1824-1881]; several dead bodies
         ("burned for they could not be moved enough to bury them") and
         broken equipment littered the site. Woodruff concludes his
         letter by pointing out that the regiment has been assigned to
         General Thomas L. Kane's (1822-1883) [Second]
         Brigade, XII Army Corps under the command of General Alpheus
         Starkey Williams [1810-1878].</p>
      <p>Also present is a photograph (carte-de-visite) of a bearded
         Woodruff, ca. 1864, in the uniform of a corporal with rank
         markings of two chevrons beneath a five-pointed small dark
         star superimposed on a larger five-pointed light-colored star
         on one sleeve. The photograph is captioned on the reverse as:
         "Bundy &amp; Williams/314 &amp; 326 Chapel St./New Haven,
         CT./M. B. Woodruff/20th Conn. Vol. Inf."</p>
      <p>In a letter of 15 January 1863 to his sister Sarah, "Burr" in the camp of the Buckingham Legion near Fairfax Station, Virginia, apologizes for
         not writing but claims the regiment has been very busy ever
         since it left "London" [Loudoun] Valley and describes his
         participation in the initial phases (December 1862) of
         Burnside's Mud March [January 20-23, 1863]: "I . . . started .
         . with a load of 50 pounds on my back &amp; in my hands. . . .
         Soldiering is hard business to say the least." He has heard of Jeb Stuart's
         [1833-1864] raid on the Orange &amp; Alexandria Railroad near Burke's Station [part of Stuart's Dumfries
         Raid, December 26-31, 1862]. Burr speculates on the army's
         next move and fears a possible 125-mile march during the rainy
         season; discusses preparations for the march; says that he is
         a member of the color guard and describes its composition and
         duties, especially the color bearer ("position of danger &amp;
         also one of Honor"); several references to "Len" (see Woodruff
         letter) and arrival of "a small box from Jane &amp; my
         sister"; and he asks for apples and the latest Connecticut
         newspapers.</p>
