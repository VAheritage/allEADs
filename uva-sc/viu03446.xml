      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a 312-page manuscript travel
         account titled, "A Voyage Through the Low Countrys Germany
         Italy and France begun in the yeare 1669 ended in 1671," kept
         by an Englishman, Thomas Style. The manuscript, apparently
         unpublished, was entered into a bound book specially prepared
         for this purpose and contains engraved title and section
         heading pages bearing engravings of maps, by the French royal
         geographer Pierre du Val.</p>
      <p>Style's account is a good early example of the genre of
         travel literature that became popular in the eighteenth
         century. Like many of his countrymen, Styles chose to visit
         the more easily accessible countries of Europe such as the Low
         Countries (Holland), Germany, Italy, and France, during his
         Grand Tour. His reasons for attempting his journey were very
         similar to those extolled in Philostratus's maxim, "If a young
         man is ambitious to raise a reputation in the world, or to
         improve in knowledge and wisdom, he should travel into foreign
         countries." For as Style makes clear in his introductory
         section, "Travel in Generall," travel was considered by his
         contemporaries to be the best method of education for a young
         man. Style uses this introduction to provide his reader with
         his own philosophy of travel and its benefits, discussing the
         various attitudes of the ancients to travel, the advantages to
         a young man, and the necessary skills and improvements
         required for a traveller, such as painting, music, riding,
         dancing, fencing, and languages (pages 3-18).</p>
      <p>He is careful to give the details of his itinerary,
         describing each town or area that he visited, what he saw or
         did at each place, as well as any antiquities or notable
         structures visible to the traveller. He also wrote of each
         area's government, employment, types of people, customs,
         religion, accomodations, and prices of both food and
         merchandise.</p>
      <p>A partial list of notable passages describing cities,
         events and other related information and the pages of the
         journal on which they occur include the following:</p>
      <p><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Low Countries (pp. 23-52)</title><lb/><lb/>The journey began on July 4, 1669, from Harwich,
         England, where Styles, accompanied by a Mr. Coxe, boarded a
         packet boat after spending the night at Colchester "much
         ruined by our late wars." They sailed for Holland on July 6th,
         encountering a storm, but arriving safely at La Brill (p. 24),
         continuing on to Rotterdam (p. 26), Delft (p. 26), and seeing
         storks (p. 27), The Hague (pp. 28-30), Ambassador Sir William
         Temple (p. 28), Leiden University with a description of its
         displays, rarities, and curiosities (p. 30), Amsterdam (pp.
         32-38) and supplying a detailed description of Amsterdam's
         magazine of the Admiralty and fire-fighting control system (p.
         33), the West India House (p. 34), and the Townhouse (p. 34).
         He also described Breda (pp. 40-42), Utrecht (pp. 44-45),
         tobacco plantations (p. 45), the seven United Provinces and
         their government (pp. 48-50), religion (pp. 50-51), and taxes
         (p. 51).</p>
      <p><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Germany, with a Map (pp.
         56-119)</title><lb/><lb/>He began this section with a grim picture of the German
         Woods and their dangerous reputation among travellers,
         especially due to the various people attracted by the
         Frankfort Fair (pp. 57 &amp; 70), a description of the
         possessions of the Elector of Brandenburg (pp. 58-59),
         reference to "one suspected a Jew," (p.59), various government
         headquarters in [Cologne ?] and its churches (pp. 60-64), and
         noted that Jews could note enter the city without the payment
         of an impost (p. 63).</p>
      <p>His group continued on to Bonn (pp. 64-66), Wiesbadan
         Forest, where they came across the remnants of two men broken
         on the wheel and met up with an armed man, illustrating the
         types of danger that a group travelling in a foreign country
         might encounter (pp. 69-72), Wiesbadan town with other stories
         concerning the danger of the woods (p. 73), Mainz (pp. 73-74),
         with a description of hunting hare (p. 74), the Frankfort Fair
         (pp. 74-75), Heidelburg (pp. 76-82), Worms (pp. 83-84), and
         Spire (pp. 84-85).</p>
      <p>He also described Strasburg (pp. 85-87), a silver mine at
         Fridenstadt worked by prisoners of war and condemned criminals
         (pp. 87-89), Stuttgart (pp. 89-91), Augsburg (pp. 93-94),
         Munich (pp. 94-99), the Jesuit's College (pp. 94-95),
         including an anachronistic reference to the Gunpowder Plot (p.
         94), Ratisbon (pp. 99-102), and Vienna and the Emperor's
         Palace (pp. 103-119). Vienna's description included a zoo of
         wild beasts (p. 105), the Treasury (p. 105), saints' relics
         and other treasures (p. 106), a rare day when the Emperor

         (p. 107), the influence of the Jesuits (p. 110), history of
         the election of the Emperors (pp. 112-119), and the eight
         Electors, the Archbishops of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne, the
         King of Bohemia, the Duke of Bavaria, the Duke of Saxony, the
         Marqrave of Brandenburg, and the Count Palatine of the Rhine
         (p. 115).</p>
      <p><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Hungary, with a map (pp.
         124-157)</title><lb/><lb/>While still in Vienna, the party heard of the fall of
         Candia, Crete, to the Turks. Style reports that the people
         feared a Turkish attack upon the Continent, but they decided
         to continue their trip to Hungary, staying in a band to
         discourage an attack by the Hussars (p. 125).</p>
      <p>Style writes concerning Altemburgh (p. 126), Latin
         appearing as an universal European language (p. 127), Raab (p.

         privilege of trial by combat for nobles (p. 137), history of
         the area (pp. 138-141), and a description of the lesser
         nobility called Hussars (p. 141).</p>
      <p><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Esclavonia, with a map (pp.
         143-157)</title><lb/><lb/>This region was known in ancient times as Illyria. Style
         described Stiria (pp. 147-148), a monastery which fell prey to

      <p><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Italy, with a map (pp. 163-258)</title><lb/><lb/>The group crossed the adriatic Sea to Venice, and began
         their Italian tour at Padua (pp. 163-167), where Style
         commented on the scholarly dissension at the University of
         Padua (pp. 164-165), Vicenza (pp. 167-168), Verona and its
         amphitheater (pp. 168-169), Brescia (p. 170), Milan (pp.

         St. John Laterans (p. 205).</p>
      <p>They undertook a voyage from Rome to Naples, which was very

         Genoa and its villas (pp. 242-247), and Style gave a summary
