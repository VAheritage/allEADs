            <p>describes the difference between "standing still
                  to be shot at and not shoot, and rushing up in the
                  fight." He writes: "When the Yankees fired at us, and
                  Latham fired at them, it was as much as the captains
                  could do to keep the men from firing at the Yankee
                  skirmishers. There were 10,000 Yankees in front of us
                  and we kept them back without firing a musket except
                  the cannon which killed 200 if not more."</p>
