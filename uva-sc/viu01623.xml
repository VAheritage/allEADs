      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>These four documents, 1778-1881, presumably trace the
         ownership of land tracts near Cedar Creek in Frederick County,
         Virginia.</p>
      <p>The first item is a parchment land grant from Thomas Lord
         Fairfax (1693-1781) as proprietor of the Northern Neck of
         Virginia, October 14, 1778. It conveys to Colonel Isaac Zane
         of Frederick County 182 acres of "waste and ungranted land on
         Cedar Creek" provided that Zane, his heirs or attorneys pay to
         Fairfax, his heirs or attorneys one shilling sterling annually
         on "the feast day of St. Michael and the Archangel [September
         29] per every fifty acres. On the reverse is a notation: "This
         is to be convay'd to Jacob Fry."</p>
      <p>The second item is a January 19, 1819 will of Frederick
         County resident William Tyler (?--1822). Among its provisions
         are bequests of various lands and possession to members of his
         family as well as instructions freeing specific slaves and of
         the emancipation of others upon their reaching the age of
         twenty-five; Tyler also stipulates that "should the laws of
         Virginia be unfavourable to the emancipation of slaves, I
         enforce it on my executor, in order to insure the freedom of
         my negroes, as aforesaid, that he remove them to some other
         state more favourable to liberty and there set them free."
         According to the 1820 Virginia Census Tyler owned
         approximately ten slaves; seven free blacks were listed as
         residing with his family. Additional entries on this document
         indicate that Tyler was deceased by September 1, 1822.</p>
      <p>The last two documents pertain to Simon Fauber of
         Shenandoah County. In a March 26, 1873 land deed between
         Fauber and James and Rachel Fry of Shenandoah and Elizabeth
         Fry of Jefferson County, West Virginia, he purchases two
         parcels of land encompassing both counties near Cedar Creek
         for the sum of five hundred dollars. The other deed of land,
         March 3, 1881, indicates that Fauber purchased land tracts in
         Shenandoah and Frederick counties (in the periphery of Cedar
         Creek) from M. A. Richards and his wife Julia for the sum of
         $1,275.</p>
      <p>Also present with the collection is a page of handwritten
         notes regarding Colonel Isaac Hite and Colonel Isaac Zane
         regarding Zane's purchase of the Marlboro Iron Works of
         Pennsylvania in 1767, and mention that Philadelphia Quakers
         exiled to Winchester, Virginia, during the American Revolution
         were placed under his custody for the duration of the war.</p>
