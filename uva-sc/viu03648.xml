        <p>The Louis Arthur Johnson Papers were a gift from the
            estate of Louis Johnson through Mr. I. Martin Leavitt of
            Steptoe and Johnson, Washington, D. C., and Mr. Oscar J.
            Andre, Steptoe and Johnson, Clarksburg, West Virginia, on 9
            January 1966. Some of the files were picked up by staff
            members in sealed and labeled transfer cases from Johnson's
            office at 1250 Connecticut Avenue, Washington, D. C., and
            some were picked up in similar cases from a storeroom in
            Clarksburg. Mrs. Ruth B. Nutter, Colonel Johnson's
            secretary for many years, undertook the assembling and
            organization of the papers before they were boxed and
            sealed.</p>

      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Louis Arthur Johnson was born on January 10, 1891, in
         Roanoke, Virginia, the son of Marcellus A. and Katherine
         Leftwich Johnson. After graduating from Jefferson High School,
         Roanoke, in 1908, he entered the University of Virginia and
         graduated in 1912 with the degree of Bachelor of Law. Johnson
         was president of the law class of 1912, a winner of public
         speaking awards, heavy-weight boxing and wrestling champion of
         the University, and a member of Delta Chi, Delta Sigma Rho,
         and the Raven Society.</p>
      <p>Moving to Clarksburg, West Virginia, in September, 1912,
         Johnson associated with John S. Rixey and Philip P. Steptos
         under the name of Steptoe, Rixey, and Johnson. After one year,
         the firm became Steptoe and Johnson and grew to be one of the
         most important in the state, with offices in Clarksburg and
         Charleston, West Virginia, and in Washington, D. C.</p>
      <p>In 1916, Johnson represented Harrison County in the House
         of Delegates and served as Chairman of the judiciary
         committee. Soon after the legislature adjourned, Johnson
         became an officer candidate in the Second Officers Training
         School at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana. He was commissioned
         Captain, Infantry Section, Officers' Reserve Corps on November
         27, 1917, and served with the 42nd Company, 11th Training
         Battalion and the 18th Company, 5th Training Battalion, 155th
         Depot Brigade until March 13, 1918 when he was transferred to
         the 305th Ammunition Train.</p>
      <p>Johnson travelled overseas in May and was appointed
         Adjutant of the Train. He participated in the Meuse-Argonne
         offensive and was honorably discharged on June 5, 1919, at
         Camp Dix, New Jersey. He was decorated with the rank of
         Commandeur Ordre National de la Legion D'Honneur by the
         Republic of France. Johnson continued his interest in military
         affairs by accepting a commission in the Officers' Reserve
         Corps.</p>
      <p>Colonel Johnson participated in the national organization
         of the American Legion in 1919 and served in various
         capacities until he was elected National Commander in 1932. He
         was later elected a life member of the National Executive
         Committees and headed the Legion's Commission on Post-War
         American in 1943.</p>
      <p>From 1933 to 1937, Johnson served as Civilian Aids to the
         Secretary of War for the state of West Virginia. He was also a
         member of the Federal Advisory Council of the United States
         Employment Services for several years. Johnson was a delegate
         to the Democratic National Convention in 1924 and served as
         chairman of the Veterans Advisory Committee of the Democratic
         National Committee from 1936 to 1937. In 1948, he served as
         chairman of the Finance Committee of the Democratic National
         Committee and was chief fund raiser for President Truman's
         campaign.</p>
      <p>From June 1937 through July 1940, Johnson served as
         Assistant Secretary of War where he voiced enthusiastic and
         effective support for the cause of national defense at a time
         when isolationism was a major topic of legislative discussion.
         In this post, he fought for an expanded air force and for an
         active program of industrial mobilization. Johnson disagreed
         with Secretary of War Harry Woodring over the transfer of arms
         to countries then fighting Germany. As a result, both men were
         replaced by President Roosevelt in 1940.</p>
      <p>From 1942 to 1947, Johnson served under the Alien Property
         Custodian, and on the Boards of General Aniline &amp; Film
         Corporation and of General Dyestuff Corporation in New
         York.</p>
      <p>From March through December, 1942, Johnson was the
         President's personal representative to India. As chairman of
         the American Advisory Mission, it was Johnson's objective to
         demtermine by means of a technical survey how the United
         States could most effectively aid in the expansion of India's
         war production.</p>
      <p>Appointed Secretary of Defense in March, 1949, Johnson
         conducted a vigorous program to cut defense expenditures and
         to unify the armed forces while maintaining a maximum of
         military strength. As the result of a long disagreement with
         Secretary of State Dean Acheson regarding the relative
         significance of Europe and Asia in American political
         thinking, Johnson resigned on September 19, 1950, and resumed
         his law practice. He spent his remaining years mainly in
         Washington, D. C.</p>
      <p>Johnson was a Mason, an Elk, a Rotarian, a member of the
         Sons of the American Revolution, and a member of the American,
         West Virginia, and New York City bar associations. His clubs
         included Clarksburg Country; Bohemian of San Francisco;
         University, Drug and Chemical, and City Midday of New York;
         and Metropolitan, National Press, Army and Navy, Burning Tree,
         and Chevy Chase of Washington.</p>
      <p>He married Ruth Frances Maxwell of Clarksburg in 1920. They
         had two daughters, Lillian Maxwell and Mrs. A. C. C. Hill, Jr.
         He died on April 24, 1966 at the age of seventy-five.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Louis Arthur Johnson Papers, ca. 1930-1964, consist of
         ca. 56 linear feet of correspondence, memoranda, appointment
         schedules, speeches, press releases, photographs, phonograph
         records, films, scrapbboks, and printed material, resulting
         from Johnson's career as Assistant Secretary of War, 1937 to
         1940, as President Roosevelt's personal representative to
         India, 1942, and as Secretary of Defense, 1949 to 1950. His
         lifelong interest in the American Legion is also represented
         in the correspondence. Only a small amount of material from th
         eyears preceding his tenure in the War Department, from the
         years following his resignation as Assistant Secretary of War,
         and from the years following his term as Secretary of Defense
         is contained in this collection.</p>
      <p>The major portion of the collection consists of
         correspondence between Johnson and his friends, supporters,
         American Legion acquaintances, and various business leaders
         and political figures associated with the concerns of national
         defense. Johnson's letters are usually very short and "to the
         point." His overriding concern for adequate national defense,
         his support for an expanded air force, and for an active
         program of industrial mobilization are well-documented in the
         Assistant Secretary of War material.</p>
      <p>The India papers document Johnson's activities while
         visiting India and contain a number of letters from Prime
         Minister Jawaharlaw Nehru.</p>
      <p>The Secretary of Defense papers contain a great deal of
         general correspondence between Johnson and his friends and
         supporters. Commentary on Johnson's efforts to reduce defense
         expenditures and on the unification of the armed forces
         abounds throught this material. Many of the letters are from
         people who voice approval of various aspects of his policies.
         There is little documentation of Johnson's dispute with
         Secretary of State Acheson concerning Far Eastern policy.</p>
      <p>An excellent photograph collection and a comprehensive
         newspaper clippings file provide thorough documentation for
         Johnson's long and active public career. Eleven scrapbooks,
         from 1949 to 1950, provide excellent coverage of Johnson's
         tenure as Secretary of Defense.</p>
      <p>The papers only concern Johnson's political career, and
         only for the years of public service. Personal papers, papers
         from his legal practice, from his business connections, and
         from state political activies are, with few exceptions, not
         included in this collection.</p>

      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>The collection arrived at the University having been
         reviewed and organized previously by Mrs. Nutter, Colonel
         Johnson's secretary. It was decided to retain Mrs. Nutter's
         basic arrangement of the material into three groups: Papers of
         the Assistant Secretary of War, India Papers, and Papers of
         the Secretary of Defense. Loose papers and material not
         included in the three major groups were sorted into three
         minor groups: papers preceding Johnson's tenure as Assistant
         Secretary of War, papers between his service as Assistant
         Secretary of War and Secretary of Defense, and papers
         following his term as Secretary of Defense. A group of
         photographs and a group of newspaper and magazine clippings
         were arranged at the end of the collection. A list of
         scrapbooks, film, phonograph records and oversize items
         following the container listing.</p>
      <p>Series I: Papers of Louis A. Johnson, ca. 1930-1935 
         <lb/><lb/>This material consists of speeches and notes for
         speeches, chronologically arranged, together with a few
         miscellaneous items, also arranged chronologically.</p>
      <p>Series II: Papers of the Assistant Secretary of War,
         1936(1937-1940) 1941 
         <lb/><lb/>This material was originally grouped into seven
         catagories and was condensed into six groups as follows: 
         <lb/><lb/>Subseries A: General Correspondence, 1937-1940; and
         Correspondence with Specific Individuals, ca. 1936-ca. 1941. 
         <lb/><lb/>General political correspondence including material of
         the following nature: speaking engagements and speeches;
         industrial mobilization and preparedness; American Legion
         Conventions and meetings; dinner and banquet invitations;
         Veterans' appeals; job requests; official memoranda; and
         reserve commission requests. The container listing which
         follows this section provides a list of the folders filed by
         individual names. The general letter file includes either
         personal or general correspondence with the following people:
         Colonel J. H. Burns, Ordnance Department Executive; Homer
         Cummings; John W. Davis; Hardy C. Dillard; Ben Dorris of the
         American Legion; William O. Douglas; John Ewing, the

         President Roosevelt; C. R. Smith, President of American
         Airlines; Henry L. Stimson; and Sumner Welles, Under Secretary
         of State.</p>
      <p>The individually labeled folders were placed before each
         general correspondence folder of the same letter of the
         alphabet. Correspondence was pulled from the general file if
         the individual concerned already had a separate folder. This
         was done because the material in both files is similar.</p>

         categories as follows: 
         <lb/><lb/>Subseries A. General Correspondence, 1949-1950 
         <lb/><lb/>This material arrived at the library sorted into coded
         groups, possibly arranged by Johnson's secretary, Mrs. Nutter.
         These groups were maintained in the event that a key to the
         code was discovered, and because the groups had a certain
         integrity. One exception to the preservation of the original
         order was the interfiling of coded groups J40, J119, J120,
         J191, and J122. This was done for two reasons: the amount of
         material in each group was small and the material in the
         groups was very similar. A description of the coded groups
         follows:
