        <p>The first portion of the Denny papers was received by
            the Library in 1947 as a gift from Collins Denny, Jr., and
            several additions were made by Mr. Denny before his death.
            The largest and most important group (#2672-c) included
            some 6,000 items received in 1951. In 1969, Mr. Denny's
            sons, Collins Denny III and Clifford M. Denny, presented
            all the remaining files of their grandfather which could be
            located in the storage areas of the family farm near
            Richmond.</p>

        <p>Although the collection comprised five groups of papers
            received at different times, for the convenience of the
            researcher, and because all the groups were originally part
            of one archive, the groups have been interfiled.</p>

               Ritenour and Margaret Ann (Collins) Denny.
               Collins' grandparents were William and Margaret
               (Hotsenpeller) Denny, descendants of David and
               Margaret (?) Denny, who emigrated from
               Londonderry, Ireland about 1720 and settled in
               Frederick County, Va. William R. Denny, his father
               was a manufacturer, President of the Winchester

          <event>After a preparatory education at Shenandoah
               Valley Academy in Winchester, Va., Collins Denny
               attended the College of New Jersey (later,

               debating and captain of the 1875 football team.
               His major interests appear to have been courses in
               history, philosophy, ethics, and English
               literature (see notes: also Physics and
               Mathematics). He also participated in

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection, filling about eighty-eight Hollinger
         storage boxes comprises the papers of Collins Denny, prominent
         Southern Methodist Bishop, teacher, author, and lawyer. The
         collection contains a very complete file of Denny's incoming
         correspondence, together with some carbons of the outgoing
         correspondence, (there are gaps in this file), both personal
         and official, as well as newspaper clippings about his career,
         drafts of his books, speeches, sermons, and articles,
         memorablilia, and materials and correspondence of the Collins
         and Denny families.</p>
      <p>The collection is rich in letters from Bishop Warren A.
         Candler; from Bishop James Canon, Jr., the "Dry Messiah"; and
         from Noah K. Davis, about whose writings Denny wrote his most
         prestigious work, an analysis of Davis' 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Elements of Deductive Logic</title>and
         his 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Elements of Psychology</title>. The
         collection will also provide an excellent basis for studies of
         any of the following topics: the organization and governance
         of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South; the protracted
         struggle over the unification of the Methodist Episcopal
         Chruch, and the Methodist Episcopal Church, South; the bitter
         court and church struggle over the trusteeship of Vanderbuilt
         University; and the Congressional controversy over the conduct
         of the Book Agents of the Publishing House of the Methodist
         Episcopal Church, South. As indicated by these suggested
         topics, the collection seems to hold the most for the
         historian particularly interested in the first quarter of this
         century.</p>

    <arrangement>
      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>The general arrangement of the Collins Denny, and Denny and
         Collins Family Papers, is in ten major series, as follows: 
         <lb/>Series I: Collins Denny Correspondence: Boxes 1-60.
         Denny's own filing system has been preserved intact for the
         most part. Incoming and outgoing letters are segregated and
         filed alphabetically, within a chronological framework. This
         last consists of five sub-series as follows: 
         <lb/><lb/>Sub-Series One: 1872-1899, Boxes 1-17 
         <lb/>Sub-Series Two: 1900-1910, Boxes 8-19 
         <lb/>Sub-Series Three: 1911-1922, Boxes 20-43 
         <lb/>Sub-Series Four: 1923-1943, Boxes 44-52 
         <lb/>Sub-Series Five: By states, Boxes 53-60.</p>
      <p>Within Denny's own correspondence, subseries Five is an
         exception. Letters here are filed according to states. The
         correspondence is designated "official" because Denny was
         acting as Secretary of the College of Bishops.</p>
      <p>Within each of the chronological series there are isolated
         correspondents. These major correspondents are filed within
         the alphabeticall order but prior to the alphabetical folder
         itself. The general arrangement of each chronological series
         is: (for ex.) A. W. Wilson, Woodrow Wilson, Wi's (incoming),
         Wi's (outgoing).</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">All the letters of each of the isolated
         correspondents</emph>are placed in one folder or a group of
         folder 
         <emph render="bold">in only one place in the papers</emph>.
         Thus there is only one folder of Woodrow Wilson's incoming
         correspondence. Similarly, all of Bishop W. A. Chandler's
         correspondence to Denny is in Series One (Boxes 1 &amp; 2)
         despite the fact that seven of the eight such folders lie
         outside the series chronologically. 
         <emph render="bold">The place of any group of letters has been
         determined, chronologically, by the first letter in the
         collection</emph>. Denny's outgoing letters to each individual
         must be sought in the alphabetically arranged outgoing files
         in series.</p>
      <p>Series II: Family correspondence, Boxes 61-65.</p>
      <p>Series III: Collins Denny: Speeches, articles, and other
         writings, Boxes 66-70, chronologically arranged.</p>
      <p>Series IV: Collins Denny: Sermons and Sermon notes, Box
         71.</p>
