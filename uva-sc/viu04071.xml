      <head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Thomas Taylor Hammond, history professor emeritus at the University of Virginia, was
                a specialist in Russian and Slavic studies, an astute observer and researcher of
                communist revolutions and Post World War II Soviet expansion initiatives, a prolific
                author and lecturer, a skilled photographer and an active civil rights advocate. He
                was born on September 15, 1920 in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Percy Waters (a
                journalist) and Elizabeth (Denman) Hammond. He was educated at the University of
                Mississippi (B. A. 1941) and took graduate studies in economics at the University of
                North Carolina (M. A. 1943). After serving in the Navy in the Pacific in World War
                II, he taught history at Emory University, and served as assistant professor of
                history at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Hammond then continued
                graduate work in Russian History Studies at Columbia University's Russian Institute
                (M. A. 1948, Ph. D., 1954).</p>
      <p>It was then that he was recruited by the University of Virginia's Dumas Malone for
                the position of assistant professor in the department of History at UVA. He taught
                courses on Soviet history and Soviet foreign policy for the next forty two years,
                rising to full professor in 1963. He was recognized as the University of Virginia's
                first Russian specialist. His concerted efforts at expanding research and faculty
                involvement in his area of study led to his founding and directing a Center for
                Russian and Slavic Studies at the University in the mid-1960's. At that time, he
                also served as president of the Southern Conference of Slavic Studies
                (1964-1965) and, in later years, president of the Conference on Slavic and
                East European History (1982-1983). He held many fellowships, including the
                Fulbright, Guggenheim, Carnegie, Ford, and Rockefeller. He was a featured speaker at
                numerous scholarly conferences and he lectured at the Military Academy at West
                Point, the Naval War College, the State Department's Foreign Service Institute and
                at many local and state-wide civic and educational organizations. He did
                comprehensive research in his field of study on his many visits outside of the
                United States. He traveled extensively throughout the USSR and Eastern Europe during
                the period of the Cold war doing research at Moscow University and interviewing
                people in all walks of life. As a skillful photographer, he compiled a massive
                collection of photo slides, many of which he used to illustrate his lectures and
                some of which he incorporated in his articles written for the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">National Geographic Magazine</title> in September, 1959, ("A First Look at the
                Soviet Union") and in March, 1966, ("An American in Moscow.") His publications
                appeared in journals, such as <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Foreign Affairs, Slavic Review,
                    American History Review, Orbis, and Political Science Quarterly</title>, and in
                numerous other journals in which he published over 100 book reviews. In 1976, he won
                a Phi Beta Kappa Prize for the best scholarly work by a faculty member at the
                University of Virginia for "The Anatomy of Communist Takeovers," which he edited.
                His other books include: "Yugoslavia Between East and West," "Lenin on Trade Unions
                and Revolution," and "Red Flag Over Afghanistan: The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan
                and its Consequences." He was also editor of "Soviet Foreign Relations and World
                Communism, A Selected, Annotated Bibliography of 7,000 Books in 30 Languages," and
                "Witness to the Origins of the Cold War."</p>
      <p>In addition to his scholarly work, Hammond was an active participant in university
                and department activities. He served on a multitude of committees including:
                Scholarship, Athletics, Non-Western Studies, Undergraduates, Foreign Students,
                Fulbright Fellowships, and Truman Scholarships. He served on the University
                President's Special Search Committees, was Secretary of the Academic Faculty for six
                years, and was a member of all of the Department of History Committees at one time
                or another.</p>
      <p>During the critical civil rights period in the 1950's and 1960's, Hammond was a force
                in bringing about racial integration. With Paul Gaston, he helped found the Martin
                Luther King Chapter of the Council on Human Relations to recruit black students and
                faculty. This effort was also carried over into the local community where Hammond
                served as president of the Charlottesville Chapter of the Council on Human
                Relations. He was also a member of the Executive Committee of the local branch of
                the NAACP, promoting social justice in local schools, parks, and other
                facilities.</p>
      <p>On February 11, 1993, Hammond died from a stroke in Charlottesville, Virginia. He was
                survived by his wife, Nancy, his son, Thomas Kent, and his stepchildren, Andrea
                Fritch Parle, and Vernon Craig Fritch.</p>
