      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>Gertrude Stein (b. Feb. 3, 1874, Allegheny, Pa., U.S.--d. July 27, 1946, Paris), was an avant-garde American writer, eccentric, and self-styled genius, whose Paris home was a salon for the leading artists and writers of the period between World Wars I and II.
</p>
      <p>Stein spent her infancy in Vienna and Paris and her girlhood in Oakland, Calif. At Radcliffe College she studied psychology with the philosopher William James. After further study at Johns Hopkins medical school she went to Paris, where she was able to live by private means. From 1903 to 1912 she lived with her brother Leo, who became an accomplished art critic; thereafter she lived with her lifelong companion Alice B. Toklas (1877-1967).</p>
      <p>Stein and her brother were among the first collectors of works by the Cubists and other experimental painters of the period, such as Pablo Picasso (who painted her portrait), Henri Matisse, and Georges Braque, several of whom became her friends. At her salon they mingled with expatriate American writers, such as Sherwood Anderson and Ernest Hemingway, and other visitors drawn by her literary reputation. Her literary and artistic judgments were revered, and her chance remarks could make or destroy reputations. In her own work, she attempted to parallel the theories of Cubism, specifically in her concentration on the illumination of the present moment and her use of slightly varied repetitions and extreme simplification and fragmentation. The best explanation of her theory of writing is found in the essay <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Composition and Explanation,</title> which is based on lectures that she gave at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and was issued as a book in 1926. Among her work that was most thoroughly influenced by Cubism is <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Tender Buttons</title> (1914), which carries fragmentation and abstraction beyond the borders of intelligibility.</p>
      <p>Her first published book, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Three Lives</title> (1909), the stories of three working-class women, has been called a minor masterpiece. <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Making of Americans,</title> a long composition written in 1906-1908 but not published until 1925, was too convoluted and obscure for general readers, for whom she remained essentially the author of such lines as "A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose." Her only book to reach a wide public was <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</title> (1933), actually Stein's own autobiography. The performance in the United States of her <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Four Saints in Three Acts</title> (1934), which the composer Virgil Thomson had made into an opera, led to a triumphal American lecture tour in 1934-1935. Thomson also wrote the music for her second opera, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Mother of Us All</title> (published 1947), based on the life of feminist Susan B. Anthony.</p>
      <p>Stein became a legend in Paris, especially after surviving the German occupation of France and befriending the many young American servicemen who visited her. She wrote about these soldiers in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Brewsie and Willie</title> (1946). </p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Series I, literary manuscripts, consists exclusively of manuscripts about Gertrude Stein by others, most notably Alice B. Toklas and Sherwood Anderson.  Sherwood Anderson's "The work of Gertrude Stein" appeared as the introduction to Stein's <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Geography and Plays</title> published in 1922.
</p>
      <p>Correspondence, the second series, is an eclectic mix of letters that displays many facets of Gertrude Stein's character.  Ranging from demanding prompt and timely payments from publishers to the fostering of artistic talents, Stein displays her unique and distinctive writing style.  Correspondents include M. A. Agelasto, Edmund R. Brown, Lt. Jean Deurel, Pierre de Massot, Sir Francis Rose, William Seabrook, and Virgil Thomson.  Also included in correspondence are letters by Alice B. Toklas.  Acting as Gertrude Stein's secretary and amanuensis, many of her letters simply relay Stein's ideas or concerns. In 1955 Toklas was asked to contribute an article about Henri Matisse to the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Yale Literary Magazine</title> and her correspondence concerning this article is included.</p>
      <p>The third series, Miscellaneous Documents, includes the official book contracts for Stein's <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Geography and Plays,</title> initially published by The Four Seas Company in 1922 but later transferred to Bruce Humphries, Inc. in 1930.  Also included is a scrapbook compiled by Edna Kenton, which includes various photographs and articles about Gertrude Stein along with published stories by Sherwood Anderson.</p>
      <p>Photographs of Gertrude Stein constitute the fourth and final series. Many of the photographs are of her visit to the University of Virginia in 1935.  Included with Stein are such figures as Alice B. Toklas, A.G.A. Balz, Scott Buchanan, Carl Van Vechten, Anna Barringer, Emily Clark Balch, James Southall Wilson, and John Cook Wyllie.</p>

              <p>Stein is flattered that Brown read her manuscript for <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Geography and Plays</title> and also flattered that he is interested in her method of writing.  She writes:  "My style has been a gradual development from <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Three Lives</title> written in 1905 through a series of studies and experiments for the freer and more profound feeling for words, studies which really take us back to the Elizabethans who also had the joy of discovering pleasure in words."  Stein then provides ideas for the "manufacturing and marketing" of the book.

              <p>Stein enjoyed spending time with Rose, and each time they get to "know each other a little more."  Tells Rose that there is a good view from St. Remy that would make a good landscape, "which is the nearest thing to a chinese landscape in miniature that xsits [sic] in Europe."  Basket is feeling better.
