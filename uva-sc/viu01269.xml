         <p>Marcus Morton Hawes, son of William and Maria (daughter of
         Governor Marcus Morton) Hawes, was born in New Bedford,
         Massachusetts, but moved to Boston in 1844, attending the
         Boston Latin School and a school run by Epes S. Dixwell, and
         graduating from Harvard in 1858. He was in the commission
         business until the war, and became a first lieutenant on May

         On the 31st of March, 1862, he was acting brigade-commissary,
         and was appointed assistant-quartermaster, with the rank of
         captain on July 17, 1862. He remained with General George
         Henry Gordon until November 1862, when he was assigned to duty

         General Nathaniel Prentiss Banks, in command of the Gulf in
         the Red River Campaign of 1863.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection consists of twenty-one Civil War letters of
         Lt. Morton Hawes (1836-?), Quartermaster, 2nd Regiment,
         [Infantry], Massachusetts Volunteers, from various camps in
         Virginia and Maryland, to his mother, Maria Morton Hawes, and
         each letter has a typed transcript. The 2nd Regiment was
         organized at Camp Andrew, West Roxbury, Massachusetts, and
         mustered in May 25, 1861. The letters tell about battles, camp
         life, speculation about the outcome of the War, comments on
         both the Union and the Confederate soldiers' fighting ability
         and strengths. Accompanying the letters are two photographs,
         including an original albumen photograph of Hawes and a
         photograph of an oil painting of his grandmother, Mary Hawes
         (1769-1859).</p>

               a long march and reached a small place called Bunker
               Hill, scattering a company of cavalry in town, and
               stayed until Wednesday, when they marched 35,000 men

               Harpers Ferry and occupy the town and open
               communications; the regiment is now located on the
               grounds occupied formerly by the Superintendent of the

               silence since the battle and retreat [Battle of
               Winchester?], has sent the deed signed in Baltimore to
               them, Colonel Gordon has finally got his promotion to
               general and appointed him to his staff, hopefully as
               captain and assistant quartermaster, believes General
               George McClellan will be defeated at Richmond, P.G.T.
               Beauregard is there with a large force from Corinth,
               Mississippi, the Union will have to resort to
               conscription to have enough men, and describes the
               retreat through the streets of Winchester, Virginia,
               "Women firing from the windows and it was pretty hard,
               it was a dire necessity but a true one to shoot them in
               their windows as they killed our wearied and defeated
               men dragging their bodies and equipments through heat
               and dust. Still on our return the imbecile doubly
               careful (?) politician Banks allowed no just retribution
               to be taken. The City still stands a monument of
               Southern cruelty &amp; Northern weakness a refuge for
               other bloody deeds which may happen any day."</p>

               government, points out that the South is fighting for
               their homes and families, while many Northerners are
