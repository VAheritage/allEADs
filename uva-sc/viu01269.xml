      <p>Marcus Morton Hawes, son of William and Maria (daughter of
         Governor Marcus Morton) Hawes, was born in New Bedford,
         Massachusetts, but moved to Boston in 1844, attending the
         Boston Latin School and a school run by Epes S. Dixwell, and
         graduating from Harvard in 1858. He was in the commission
         business until the war, and became a first lieutenant on May
         24, 1861. On August 12, 1861, he was appointed acting-
         quartermaster, and became actual quartermaster on November 27.
         On the 31st of March, 1862, he was acting brigade-commissary,
         and was appointed assistant-quartermaster, with the rank of
         captain on July 17, 1862. He remained with General George
         Henry Gordon until November 1862, when he was assigned to duty
         with General Andrews, about to go south in the expedition of
         General Nathaniel Prentiss Banks, in command of the Gulf in
         the Red River Campaign of 1863.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of twenty-one Civil War letters of
         Lt. Morton Hawes (1836-?), Quartermaster, 2nd Regiment,
         [Infantry], Massachusetts Volunteers, from various camps in
         Virginia and Maryland, to his mother, Maria Morton Hawes, and
         each letter has a typed transcript. The 2nd Regiment was
         organized at Camp Andrew, West Roxbury, Massachusetts, and
         mustered in May 25, 1861. The letters tell about battles, camp
         life, speculation about the outcome of the War, comments on
         both the Union and the Confederate soldiers' fighting ability
         and strengths. Accompanying the letters are two photographs,
         including an original albumen photograph of Hawes and a
         photograph of an oil painting of his grandmother, Mary Hawes
         (1769-1859).</p>

               hard and cold march, no time to forward a letter by

          <p>Morton, Front Royal, Virginia, apologizes for his
               silence since the battle and retreat [Battle of
               Winchester?], has sent the deed signed in Baltimore to
               them, Colonel Gordon has finally got his promotion to
               general and appointed him to his staff, hopefully as
               captain and assistant quartermaster, believes General
               George McClellan will be defeated at Richmond, P.G.T.
               Beauregard is there with a large force from Corinth,
               Mississippi, the Union will have to resort to
               conscription to have enough men, and describes the
               retreat through the streets of Winchester, Virginia,
               "Women firing from the windows and it was pretty hard,
               it was a dire necessity but a true one to shoot them in
               their windows as they killed our wearied and defeated
               men dragging their bodies and equipments through heat
               and dust. Still on our return the imbecile doubly
               careful (?) politician Banks allowed no just retribution
               to be taken. The City still stands a monument of
               Southern cruelty &amp; Northern weakness a refuge for
               other bloody deeds which may happen any day."</p>

          <p>Morton, Warrenton, Virginia, have been to Washington
               on business and now cut off from his regiment by swollen
               streams, waiting in a little dirty hotel to join them,
               criticizes the North for its sleepy inactivity in the
               face of a foe, with more men more skillfully managed,
               better attitude, and fighting at home, wishes the army
               would impose "a military dictator &amp; put down this
               rebellion through one head &amp; one mind I would
               enforce this upon Lincoln Stanton &amp; Co. by the
               bayonets" and believes the South has adopted a more
               enlightened plan of leadership.</p>

               "we are now under the great Pope &amp; we have already
               made up our minds he is more than half humbug," leave
               canceled for the present, drafting for the North has

               Governor of Massachusetts, does not believe in "people
               rule," Captain Underwood has gotten a position as Lt.
               Colonel in one of the new regiments, the 33rd, which is
               led by Colonel Albert C. Maggi, who kept a gymnasium in
               N.B. and was involved in a scandal with Mrs. Charles
               Howland.</p>

          <p>Morton, Bull Run, writes, "I wrote you just after our
               terrific slaughter at Cedar Mountain Now the whole
               Richmond Army is on us &amp; we have retreated, the
               wagons are here and the troops about 20 miles beyond. We
               have abandoned per force, nearly all our acquirements of
               the past year. Here I am right near the old battlefield.
               McClellan is with us, but the enemy can get through the
               valley, destroy the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and go
               into Maryland."</p>

          <p>Morton, near Washington, describes the events of the
               last few weeks, at the Battle of Second Bull Run
               "Everything has been so confused and so disastrous that
               we have had neither mail or in many cases food. The
               people do not know it but we have had a series of
               unparalleled defeats without the least ray of the
               sunshine of victory." He severely criticizes President
               Lincoln, General John Pope, and the United States
               government, points out that the South is fighting for
               their homes and families, while many Northerners are
               fighting for abstractions, such as the flag, believes
               the Rebels can take Washington and Maryland, and
               mentions his regiment has been driven out of Virginia
               three times.</p>
