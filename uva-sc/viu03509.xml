            Chicago, Illinois, and accessioned under the number 1532.
            The papers were subsequently purchased by the Library from

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers of the Walker Family of Rockbridge County,
         Virginia, contain ca. 1200 items (2 Hollinger boxes, ca. 1
         linear foot) 1753-1873. This collection consists of
         correspondence, business and legal papers, autographs,
         military documents, poems, bound ledgers and memoirs, and
         miscellaneous papers.</p>
      <p>These papers pertain to Alexander Walker, his siblings, and
         five generations of their descendants. The Walker business and
         legal documents, which include receipts, promissory notes,
         slave information, indentures, insurance contracts, articles
         of agreement, and Alexander Walker's will, reveal that
         Alexander Walker was a merchant, mill owner, money lender, and
         captain in the local militia.</p>
      <p>Several business and legal documents (Box 1) mention the
         sale of slaves. Among these are: a slave boy named Moses
         bequeathed to Mary Walker (1802 June 23); the sale of a five
         year old Negro boy named Kennaday (1803 July 18); the transfer
         of a slave girl named Maria ( 1816 July 13); the sale of a
         mulatto boy named Bill (1840 August 31); the conditions for
         hiring a Negro girl named Maria (1840 September 1); the hire
         of Negro woman named Malinda (1857 January 21); and conditions
         for a slave sale (1813 February 11).</p>
      <p>Other items of interest in the business and legal documents
         include: an executor's questions regarding John Walker's will,
         which mentions his slaves by name (1806 October); the
         withdrawal of insurance because of a fire (1821 December 6); a
         stock certificate for Snicker's Gap Turnpike Co. (1824
         December 9); Margaret Walker's will (1827); a bill from James
         River &amp; Kanawha Company for unpaid installments of their
         stocks (1837 April 14); Alexander Walker's will (1841); a bill
         of lading for a steamboat named "Reliamoe" (1859 April 22);
         information on the tax exempt law for principal and interest
         (1864 May 13); a "tax in kind" form (1865 January 18); a
         receipt of Donovan &amp; O'Toole Grocer's and Shippers (1868
         March 31); a receipt of Baker Brothers, Wholesale and Retail
         Grocers, and Dealers in Flour, Grain and Country Produce (1867
         October 22); and a description of a patent assignment for an
         improved adjustable brace gate (1876 July 1).</p>
      <p>Letters in the collection indicate that Walker family
         members migrated to both Tennessee and Missouri. A majority of
         the correspondence is from John Walker, a brother of
         Alexander, who resided in Missouri. Within these letters there
         is information pertaining to the general level of trade, the
         prices of various goods, political events, the existence of
         droughts, and the presence of diseases such as smallpox,
         scarlet fever, cholera, and yellow fever.</p>
      <p>Some items of interest in the correspondence files (Box 2)
         include: a mention of John Walker leaving Colonel Tucker's to
         teach school with Mrs. Flint (1817 March 6); John Walker's
         employment at the Sheriff's Office (1819 February 14); a
         statement about a steamboat traveling between St. Louis and
         Ohio, as well as New Orleans (1817 August 8); a letter stating
         the major concerns of the Missouri Assembly then in session
         (1818 December 19); the population of Gasconade in 1818 (1818
         December 24); an opinion of slavery and information about
         Illinois being a haven for runaway Negroes and renegades (1820
         April 16); complaints concerning epidemics of typhus fever and
         dysentery (1822 July 15); John Walker's campaign for election
         as Sheriff (1822 August 9); Major Sibley's commission to build
         a road to Sante Fe (1825 September 14); the presence of
         smallpox (1831 September 13); the effects of scarlet fever
         (1832 January 7); the election of J. Stuart to Congress, son
         of Robert Stuart (1838 August 26); the Fiscal Corporation Bill
         up for possible veto by the President (1841 September 12);
         mention of the Whig candidate for the districts of Shenandoah,
         Rockingham, Hardy, Pendleton, Augusta, and Rockbridge,
         Alexander Stuart of Staunton, Virginia and the opposing
         candidate, William Taylor of Lexington (1843 May 7);
         excitement concerning the Pacific Railroad, the Great National
         Railway and accounts of the success of the California gold
         mines (1850 February 13).</p>
      <p>One member of the Walker family, Sam A. Walker, served in
         Company H, 14th Virginia Cavalry, under Captain J.A. Gibson,
         during the Civil War and his letters mention the scarcity of
         feed for the horses and disagreeable officers (1862 May 4
         &amp; 16, and June 13; and 1863 Sep 27).</p>
      <p>Also included in Box 2 are land grants with the autographs
         of the following Virginia Governors: Barbour, James Nelson,
         William Brooke, Robert Nicholas, Wilson Cary Cabell, William
         Page, John Fauquier, Francis Pleasants, James Giles, William
         Randolph, Thomas Mann Guaranty, John Smith, George Lee, Henry
