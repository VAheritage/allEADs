         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>There are ca. thirty-five letters, July 1918 through
         September 1919, from Cecil E. Cather of the 314th Engineering,
         89th Division, American Expeditionary Forces, to Ella May
         Erdman. Letters written during July 1918 to April 1919 were
         chiefly from places in Germany following the Armistice. Prior
         to the Armistice, a letter of July 11th discusses France and
         the French people; and, a letter of October 15th mentions
         Germany getting trounced, Bulgaria requesting an Armistice for
         peace, John Sousa and violin music, and Billie Burke.
         Following the Armistice, Cather writes from Rhineland and
         other places in Germany. On December 8th, Cather comments on
         the reception of the Americans by the Germans; the Allies
         rules and regulations; the French, Belgian, and German
         peoples; conditions in Germany, including the scarcity of
         essentials and high prices. A letter of January 24th concerns
         the bad conditions in Germany and assistance provided by the
         Red Cross, Salvation Army and the Knights of Columbus. Cather
         also gives his opinion on suffragists. A letter of January
         26th describes an old castle in Kyllburg and discusses
         activities such as seeing moving pictures and vaudeville.
         Letters of March 10th and 18th discuss the beauty of the
         Rheine and the Rhine River and some of the local legends; the
         respect for the hard work of the women of the Red Cross;
         trading certain items with German prisoners; and, A. E. F.
         activities and entertainment. On April 29th, Cather writes
         that General [John Joseph] Pershing reviewed the division and
         conferred honors.</p>
         <p>In June 1919, Cather writes several letters from War Camp
         Community Service, Camp Devens, Massachusetts, concerning
         discharging troops, the deserted camp, R. O. T. C. Infantry
         Camp being there for the summer, canoeing, community
         activities, and discusses a local scandal about an interracial
         couple and the intolerance of people. Letters of July 1919,
         from the War Department Committee on Education and Special
         Training, Boston, mention the old "Blue Laws," taking Spanish,
         the enthusiastic greeting for a group of "casual soldiers,"
         and carnival oddities. A letter of August 26th, from Camp
         Humphreys, Virginia, mentions the war workers from the
         different government buildings and hopes of being discharged
         since the ratification of the peace treaty. Letters of
         September 7th and 15th, from War Camp Community Service in
         Washington, D.C., discuss the city being a residential town
         with plenty of amusement, the parade of the 1st Division next
         Wednesday, and the great welcome received by General
         Pershing.</p>
