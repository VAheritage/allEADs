      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This addition to the papers of the 
         <famname>Meade family</famname>of 
         <geogname>Amelia County, Virginia</geogname>, contains ca. one
         hundred items (1 Hollinger box; .5 linear feet), 1770-1872,
         and chiefly consists of correspondence, business, and legal
         papers.</p>
      <p>The largest group of correspondence is that of 
         <persname>Hodijah Baylies</persname>(1755-?) and his son, 
         <persname>Edmund Baylies</persname>, to his namesake, 
         <persname>Hodijah Meade</persname>(d. 1842 ?) and his son, 
         <persname>William E. Meade</persname>. These letters show a
         continuation of friendship and affection that had begun
         between 
         <persname>Hodijah Baylies</persname>and 
         <persname>Everard Meade</persname>(1746-1802), father of
         Hodijah, when they were both aides-de-camp to Major General 
         <persname>[Benjamin ?] Lincoln</persname>during the
         Revolutionary War.</p>
      <p>One letter, December 20, 1832, discusses the rank of 
         <persname>Everard Meade</persname>in the Continental Army and
         the possibility of erecting a tombstone to his memory. Another
         letter, September 13, 1835, from the northerner, 
         <persname>Edmund Baylies</persname>, expresses sympathy for
         anti-abolitionist sentiments.</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>Everard Meade</persname>include correspondence from 
         <persname>R[ichard] K[idder] Meade</persname>, July 3, 1777,
         concerning the actions of a party of militia who captured a
         ship of produce on the New Jersey shore; 
         <persname>D[avid] M. Randolph</persname>(son of Richard
         Randolph, Jr. of Curle) and 
         <persname>David Meade</persname>.</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>Hodijah Meade</persname>include the following
         correspondents: 
         <persname>T.H. Drew</persname>, 
         <persname>T.B. Massie</persname>, 
         <persname>John R. Meade</persname>, 
         <persname>William E. Meade</persname>, 
         <persname>J. Parker</persname>, 
         <persname>L.J. Preston</persname>and 
         <persname>William E. Preston</persname>. One letter, April 3,
         1837, mentions a poisoning attempt by a servant girl and
         failures in the Panic of 1837.</p>
      <p>Correspondence to 
         <persname>William E. Meade</persname>contains chiefly news of
         friends and family and includes the following writers: 
         <persname>Edward Coles</persname>, 
         <persname>John P. DuVal</persname>, 
         <persname>R. Gwathmey</persname>, 
         <persname>J.V. Ligon</persname>, 
         <persname>Hodijah Meade</persname>, 
         <persname>J.R. Meade</persname>, 
         <persname>Francis H. Smith</persname>, and 
         <persname>Edmund Randolph</persname>.</p>
      <p>Known correspondents in the miscellaneous group of letters
         include: 
         <persname>Peter Hagner</persname>, 
         <persname>Hodijah Baylies Meade</persname>, 
         <persname>Peyton Meade</persname>, 
         <persname>R.H. Meade</persname>, 
         <persname>William E. Meade</persname>, and 
         <persname>W[illiam] B. Tabb</persname>. Topics of interest
         include: the movement of some Confederate forces under General
         <persname>Henry S. Wise</persname>, February 6, 1863; the
         critical condition and eventual death of 
         <persname>Jane Meade</persname>(daughter of William E. and
         Mary (Steger) Meade, February 21, and March 21, 1864; and 
         <persname>Hodijah Baylies Meade</persname>urging his brother
         [William ?] to sell his farm at the Hermitage and to buy a
         small farm in the "valley," presumably the 
         <geogname>Shenandoah Valley</geogname>, and warning him not to
         consider 
         <geogname>Danville, Virginia</geogname>, as suitable farming
         country as it was overworked by tobacco, January 30,1868.</p>
      <p>Letters of 
         <persname>Thomas Rutherfoord, Sr.</persname>(father-in-law of 
         <persname>Hodijah Meade</persname>) to members of the 
         <famname>Meade family</famname>mainly concern the family flour
         mill business, family news, and grandfatherly advice. This
         group of letters also contains a few letters by 
         <persname>Thomas Rutherfoord, Jr.</persname>and 
         <persname>Samuel Rutherfoord</persname>, brothers of 
         <persname>Hodijah Meade</persname>'s wife, Jane (d. 1839
         ?).</p>
      <p>Other items in this collection include: an almanac, an
         arithmetic book, wills, receipts, a survey, deeds and
         indentures and accounts. Of special interest are: a survey for
         <persname>Everard Meade</persname>in 
         <geogname>Amelia County</geogname>(October 5, 1770); the will
         of 
         <persname>Everard Meade</persname>(January 13, 1801); the will
         of 
         <persname>Hodijah Meade</persname>(May 30, 1840); and a bounty
         land claim based on 
         <persname>Hodijah Meade</persname>'s service in the War of
         1812 (May 1859).</p>
      <p>The correspondence is arranged chronologically by the
         correspondent or recipient of the letter. The business and
         legal papers are also in chronological order.</p>
