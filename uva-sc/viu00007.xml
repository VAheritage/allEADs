                     collections, the University of Virginia Library has given much attention to the

      <p> The online edition of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Calendar of The Jefferson Papers of the
               University of Virginia</title> combines into one chronological sequence the original
            1950 calendar compiled by Constance Thurlow and Francis Berkeley and the 1973 supplement
            compiled by Anne Freudenberg and John Casteen. All Jefferson items in the possession of
            the University of Virginia Library are now included; new entries are added as additional
            Jefferson items are acquired by the Library. </p>
      <p> The <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Calendar</title> contains entries for all letters and
            documents in our collections written by or to Jefferson; letters docketed by Jefferson;
            19th century copies of Jefferson letters transcribed by family members; photomechanical
            reproductions of some privately-held Jefferson letters, and of some Jefferson letters in
            other institutions (most notably the correspondence with Tadeusz Kosciuszko in the
            National Museum of Krakow, Poland), which are inaccessible to most researchers; and the
            Peter Jefferson documents held by the Library. </p>
      <p> In updating the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Calendar</title> we retained the basic format of
            the earlier printed versions. A typical entry consists of the name of the writer, the
            place from which he writes, the name of the recipient, and the place to which the letter
            is directed, followed by the date of manuscript. This is followed by a brief physical
            description of the manuscript (e.g. ALS; typescript; 19th century copy, number of pages)
            and, for entries made between 1950 and 1973, information about the location of other
            copies and citations to printed versions. We have made no attempt to supplement entries
            for materials acquired since 1970 with notes on the location of other copies or
            additional citations of printed versions. The name of the University of Virginia Library
            collection of which the manuscript is a part and the collection's accession number are
            also included. The entry concludes with a summary of the text of the manuscript. Entries
            from the 1950 and 1973 editions are followed by a bracketed number that was assigned for
            purposes of indexing. </p>
      <p> We have made several significant changes to the entries. The word "slave" replaces the
            word "servant" in all cases where the editors were sure the individual indicated was a
            slave. All photomechanical reproductions are given the generic label "photostat."
            Changes in ownership are noted when known. Each of Jefferson's architectural drawings is
            listed individually with the corresponding "Nichols number" taken from <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Thomas Jefferson's architectural drawings</title> / compiled and with
            commentary and a check list by Frederick Doveton Nichols. -- 4th ed. - (Charlottesville
            : Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, 1988, c1995.) </p>

      </p>
      <p>In preparing this calendar of the University's Jefferson manuscripts, Mrs. Thurlow and I
            have freely made use of many people's work. Daily reference has been made to our
            Jefferson Checklist, a chronological card-file of some sixty thousand of Jefferson's
            manuscripts, and letters to and from him, now known to be extant in public and private
            libraries, in manuscript and in print. This Checklist was begun by John Cook Wyllie more
            than fifteen years ago, and has been expanded by many hands, particularly by a former
            staff member, Mrs. Helen D. Bullock. The Checklist is now being duplicated, expanded,
            and improved by Julian P. Boyd and the editors associated with him in the Princeton
            University publication project. Copies of the Checklist in its final form may later be
            made available at the Library of Congress as well as at the University of Virginia, and
            I venture to express here the hope that it may be printed for the use of students
            elsewhere. For it will contain much of value which must doubtless be omitted from
            publication in the Papers.</p>
      <p>The typescript calendar of our Jefferson Papers, prepared by Mrs. Bullock in 1941, has
            been very useful here and at the Library of Congress, and particularly helpful in
            preparing the present calendar for publication. Printing costs and other factors have
            made necessary a more condensed form of entry in the present calendar. Since the
            preparation of Mrs. Bullock's calendar, which included photostats in our collections,
            our holdings of original manuscripts have nearly doubled. Photographic copies (more than
            10,000 now being available in our reading room) have here been excluded except in a few
            instances of manuscripts in private hands and county court houses, which in a number of
            cases are the only known texts.</p>
      <p>Researchers are warned that the length of an entry does not necessarily indicate our
            judgment of the importance of the item. We have attempted to include all names of
            persons and places. As a result, entries for certain legal documents are
            disproportionately long. We have tried to mention all major subjects discussed in each
            letter, but the reader who wants full details will be obliged to consult the original
            manuscript or order a photographic copy.</p>
      <p>Each entry contains two paragraphs, the second of which is a condensed summary of the
            text of the manuscript, followed by a bracketed number for purposes of indexing. The
            first paragraph contains all "bibliographical data" about the manuscript and all other
            texts of it which are known to us from the data recorded and filed in our Jefferson
            Checklist. Following the date in a typical entry is the name of the writer, the place
            from which he writes, the name of the recipient, and the place to which the letter is
            directed. Then follows a symbol (see list below) which tells whether the manuscript is
            signed and whether or not it is written in the hand of the signer, with a statement of
            the number of pages in the manuscript. If another text of the manuscript is known to us,
            this information is then given as explicitly as possible. In some cases we can only say
            "another manuscript in DLC" (Library of Congress; see list of abbreviations below);
            often, however, we are able to state that the other manuscript is the recipient's copy,
            a polygraph copy, a letterpress copy, a file draft, or an extract or copy by another
            hand, either contemporary or later.</p>
      <p>The final statement in each heading concerns known printed versions of the manuscript as
            recorded in our Jefferson Checklist. Many of the published texts are inaccurate or
            incomplete, as we indicate when known. All frequently cited publications are referred to
            by symbols (as listed in the table below) and punctuation is simplified for convenience
            in printing.</p>
      <p>Special attention is invited to the case of "printing" which we indicate by the
            following oft-recurring expression: "Printed: B of R VI 372 (MS. in DLC)". This means
            that an abstract of another text of our manuscript (the other text usually being
            Jefferson's file copy) is to be found in the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Calendar of
               Letters from Jefferson,</title>in the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Bulletin of the Bureau
               of Rolls and Library of the Department of State,</title>No. 6, Washington, 1894-1896
            page 372, and that the manuscript so calendared is now in the Library of Congress.
            Virtually none of the Jefferson manuscripts in the Bureau of Rolls (all of which are now
            in the Library of Congress) were printed in full in the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Calendar</title>which appeared in volumes 6 (letters from Jefferson) and 8 (letters
            to Jefferson) of the Bulletin. It is hoped that no student will be misled by this
            type-saving method of entry. All other printings indicated are assumed to be complete
            unless otherwise stated.</p>
      <p>Docketing, and other brief endorsements on letters are indicated simply by the word
            "endorsed" unless they appear to require special comment. "Endorsed by T. J." indicates
            that such an endorsement is in Jefferson's autograph. Spelling has normally been
            corrected outside of direct quotations, and we have never hesitated to expand "Mr.
            Randolph" to "Thomas Mann Randolph" when the identity is certain. Square brackets have,
            therefore, been rather sparingly used to supply missing names, facts, and dates in the
            headings which could be supplied with reasonable certainty. In summarizing the texts of
            letters and other items, the main object has been brevity rather than any attempt to
            reproduce the original language. Parentheses have been freely used in the summaries for
            the provision of explanatory comment.</p>
      <p>All manuscripts not otherwise designated are in our general collection of Jefferson
            Papers. Others are listed in the heading of the entry as being in the McGregor Library
            (which is the most important of the special libraries constituting the Division of Rare
            Books and Manuscripts) or in any of our various collections of manuscripts which happen
            to contain papers of Jefferson, such as the following: the Berkeley Manuscripts, the
            Cabell Papers, the Carr-Cary Papers, the Cocke Papers, the Edgehill-Randolph Papers, and
            the Page-Walker Papers. Some of these special collections are not owned by the
            University, but are on deposit for safekeeping and historical reference. Other privately
            owned individual manuscripts on deposit are listed with the owner's name. Photographic
            copies can be provided in most cases, but a few are subject to restrictions stipulated
            by the owner.</p>
      <p>It will be noted that we have included certain manuscripts of Jefferson's father which
            have some relevancy to the career of the son. In addition to a few special photostats
            already mentioned, a number of older transcripts of Jefferson's papers have also been
            included. The most important of these are the copies and extracts made by Martha
            Jefferson Randolph and her daughters and by Nicholas P. Trist during the decade
            following Jefferson's death. These and other copies have been identified in the
            headings. In a considerable number of cases, however, chiefly of copies which appear to
            have been made by or for members of the family, we have had to fall back on the
            expression, "19th century copy".</p>
      <p>Omitted from this calendar are a number of papers in this library which were once in
            Jefferson's possession, or closely associated with him, but which were not composed,
            drafted, or endorsed by him. Such, for example, are the groups of legal papers,
            1740-1759, which Robert Carter Nicholas turned over to him as attorney in 1771; a
            correspondence of the Associates of the late Doctor Bray, 1757-1773, concerning the
            Negro school at Williamsburg, sponsored by the Society for the Propagation of the
            Gospel; correspondence of Robley Dunglison with Jefferson's biographer, Henry S.
            Randall; and great numbers of letters by Jefferson's executor and by members of his
            immediate family which are to be found in the University archives and such of our
            collections as the Carr-Cary Papers, the Edgehill-Randolph Papers, and the Francis
            Walker Gilmer Manuscripts. Typical of other materials omitted are an eighteen-page
            manuscript pedigree of the Jefferson family, compiled by Paul Berghaus, and kept with
            our Jefferson Papers for the convenience of researchers; memorial addresses following
            Jefferson's death in 1826; and letters of condolence to his family. A revealing item of
            Jeffersoniana, omitted here, but shortly-to be published by the library as a separate
            volume, is the manuscript of the recollections of Isaac Jefferson, a household slave at
            Monticello, as dictated in old age to the historian, Charles Campbell.</p>
      <p>One conspicuous omission which we hope will not be attributed to ingratitude has been
            that of the names of donors. From 1825 to 1949 we have received from Jefferson himself,
            from every generation of his descendants, and from a host of admirers of Jefferson and
            friends of the University, gifts of Jeffersoniana or funds for their acquisition. The
            addition of donors' names to already elaborate calendar headings, particularly in the
            group entries covering numerous separate gifts, might, we feel, confuse the student. In
            our published annual reports we attempt at least to record from year to year the names
            of the benefactors on whom we rely so heavily for the growth of the collections.</p>
      <p>To the Research Council of the Richmond Area University Center we are indebted for the
            grant-in-aid which has made possible this publication. The courtesy and patience of the
            Administrator and of the members of the Council in connection with our unavoidable
            delays in printing are particularly appreciated.</p>
      <p>If this work had a dedication, it would be to Harry Clemons, who brought the Manuscript
            Division into being, whose faith has a way of moving mountains, and to whom all of the
            daily tasks of our staff are truly dedicated by our admiration and affection.</p>

            <p>A committee of five, consisting of Jefferson, Thomas Ludwell Lee, George Mason,
                     Edmund Pendleton, and George Wythe, were appointed by the Virginia Convention
                     of 1776 to draft a revision of the Virginia laws--the genesis of Jefferson's
                     epochal work for religious and intellectual freedom. Lee died, Mason resigned,
                     and the work was divided among the other three. Jefferson prepared the sections
                     on common law and statutes to 4 James I; Wythe prepared the British statutes
                     from that date to 1776; Pendleton worked on laws passed in Virginia. The index
                     is in Jefferson's hand, the ordinances in several other hands, probably of
                     clerks of the committee. Jefferson indexes 126 bills, 66 of which are included
                     in this draft. The bills were printed by Dixon and Holt, Richmond, 1784.

            <p>T. J. refers to Bland's recent letter to former Governor [Patrick] Henry
                     forwarding an unspecified request from British General [William] Phillips,
                     currently imprisoned with the British troops at the Barracks in Albemarle
                     County, Va. He discusses the barbarities of Indian attacks upon settlers at the
                     instigation of British General [Henry] Hamilton into whose conduct the Council
                     [of State] will soon be inquiring, noting that there should be a respect for
                     Hamilton's "honorable bravery" in opposition to the "cruel &amp; cowardly
                     warfare of the savage, whose object in war is to extinguish human nature." He
                     informs Bland that the militia under his command should be discharged, repeats
                     Colonel [William] Finnie's instructions on applying for clothes for Bland's
                     regiment of guards and horse, and authorizes him to put the guards and horse
                     under his command together on the same payroll as both are part of the
                     Continental Army. </p>

            <p>Nine codes are included. Most of these are simple substitution ciphers,
                     numerals being substituted for words or syllables. Two are more complicated;
                     one is developed from a column arrangement of the Lord's Prayer; another is a
                     dictionary cipher involving the use of a French-English pocket dictionary. One
                     of the number codes in Jefferson's hand has a note, "frequently throw in
                     numbers higher than 1545, which meaning nothing will serve to perplex." Some
                     codes are endorsed with names of users, Robert R. Livingston, J. M. [James
                     Madison?], Thomas Jefferson, Edmund Randolph, Edmund Pendleton.

                     of the needle for all different meridians whatever," to be applied during a
                     voyage between America and Europe; expresses difficulties that would occur;
                     discusses the need to address questions raised by the French Academy of
                     Science; and ending with, "I shall be happy that our country may have the
                     honour of furnishing the old world what it has so long sought in vain."
                     Jefferson may be referring for the work Churchman eventually published in
                     Philadelphia in 1790: <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">An explanation of the magnetic

            <p>Copy used by Jefferson, containing his manuscript additions, revisions, maps,
                     and plates. Bound into this book are eleven letters of Edward D. Ingraham of

                     publication of the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Notes</title> from this copy, then

                     appeared between 1847 and 1853, it can be assumed that Smith's work was either
                     not published or was published by J. W. Randolph in 1853 without mention of

            <p>Cites reasons why Washington should continue as President: a public debt so
                     large that it strains the impost; draining of specie abroad by payments on the

                     the legislature, and menaces the republican form of government. Only hope of
                     safety lies in numerous representation. Possibility of a split North and South
                     if the paper money, monarchical interest remains dominant. Negotiations with
                     England and Spain are at a delicate point. <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">[343]</bibref></p>

            <p>T. J. asks Rutledge for 20 bushels of cowpeas, gives instructions on shipping
                     to Charles Johnston &amp; Co., Richmond and payment through John Barnes of
                     Philadelphia, and discusses improvements he has made on the Lieth machine for
                     threshing wheat in Virginia and rice in South Carolina. T. J. continues with a
                     discussion of how much unmerited abuse and praise he has suffered in public
                     service, his wish for retirement, the outcome of the election of 1796 which he
                     knows Adams will win adding "I know well that no man will ever bring out of
                     that office the reputation which carries him into it. the honeymoon would be as
                     short in that case as in any other, &amp; it's moment of extasy would be
                     ransomed by years of torment &amp; hatred." He predicts he will live in
                     peace while Adams will be shipwrecked in the gathering storm, but nevertheless
                     urges Rutledge to continue in national public office for "there is no bankrupt
                     law in heaven by which you may get off with shillings in the pound, with
                     rendering to a single state what you owed to the whole confederacy."

            <p>These notes are from ca. 1800, as the remodeling of Monticello is mentioned in
                     the notes. These drawings, however, are not for Monticello, but for a house in
                     town, probably Philadelphia. These drawings were evidently modified and
                     submitted to James Barbour for Barboursville in 1817 as stated by Kimball.

            <p>Met Henry at Nathaniel West Dandridge's home in Hanover while traveling to
                     William and Mary College. Henry's legal training inadequate. Peyton Randolph,
                     John Randolph, and Robert C. Nicholas reluctantly signed license; George Wythe
                     would not sign. Henry, Burgess for Hanover, stopped John Robinson's loan office
                     scheme. Henry's support for George Johnston's resolution against English
                     Parliament's stamp tax crushed power of Peyton Randolph, Richard Bland, Edmund
                     Pendleton, Robert C. Nicholas, George Wythe, Peter Randolph, etc. T. J. Burgess
                     for Albemarle when Lord Botetourt Governor of Virginia. Henry and T. J. agreed
                     on principles while serving in House of Delegates. Henry and Richard Henry Lee
                     poor performers at first Continental Congress. Edmund Pendleton and Benjamin
                     Harrison reported that William Livingston, Governor of New Jersey, John Jay.
                     and John Dickinson surpassed Henry and Lee. Address to King and people of Great
                     Britain. When Lord Dunmore called Peyton Randolph to Virginia Assembly
                     concerning Lord North's proposals, T. J. replaced Randolph in Continental
                     Congress. Mentions George Washington and Declaration of Independence. Henry
                     appointed Colonel of Virginia Convention's 1st regiment. Lived at Roundabout in
                     Louisa. Hunted deer in Fluvanna. Bought land of Mr. Lomax on Smith River. Yazoo
                     speculations brought condemnation from Virginia Legislature. Case of Jones and
                     Walker. British debts. Henry opposed U.S. Constitution and hated George
                     Washington. Hamilton's funding system. Henry declined mission to Spain, hoped
                     to be Secretary of State. Deserted Republicanism for Federalism.

                     expedition. Gift of tobacco seed to Von Humboldt. <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">[1261]</bibref></p>

              here is also a "Free" frank stamp, a partially legible postmark, and the remnants of a wax seal.

            <p>T. J. writes to Patrick Gibson regarding the sale of tobacco which T. J. has recently learned "sells high and readily"; he asks Gibson to sell his 
              tobacco "as soon as you think advisable." As for the sale of his flour, T. J. suggests it is "best to give time for the European vessels which would 
              not adventure to sail until they learnt there our ratification of the treaty, to arrive and produce here a full competition of demand" which he thinks will 
              happen in May. T. J. asks Gibson to sell the flour "for whatever price shall then be going" unless Gibson receives a comparable price before then. T. J. 
              states that he will "in the course of the present week or next" send Gibson $2000 of Treasury notes. T. J. closes with expressions of esteem and 
              respect. <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">[1345]</bibref></p>

            <p>T. J. thanks Holmes for a copy of his pamphlet <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Mr.
                        Holmes' letter to the people of Maine</title> in which Holmes argued that
                     any restriction on the admission of Missouri would be unconstitutional. T. J.
                     responds that the issue of the extension of slavery to the territories which
                     was temporarily solved by the Missouri Compromise has "like a fire-bell in the
                     night, awakened and filled me with terror. I considered it at once as the knell
                     of the Union." He writes of the difficulty of a practical solution to the issue
                     of slavery and emancipation for "we have the wolf by the ear, and we can
                     neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and
                     self-preservation in the other." T. J. believes that a diffusion of slavery
                     over a broader territory would make emancipation easier and cautions against
                     Congress interfering in state issues. He concludes that he will now die
                     believing "that the useless sacrifice of themselves by the generation of 1776
                     ... is to be thrown away by the unwise and unworthy passions of their sons, and
                     that my only consolation is to be, that I live not to weep over it."

            <p>TJ requests information about John Sanderson who proposed to publish a
                     multi-volume biograhy of the Signers. TJ explains that he has already sent
                     information on George Wythe to Sanderson and received the first volume in
                     return and found it "superiorly written; exhibiting mind, information &amp;
                     polisth, a little too florid perhaps for the sober style of history ...."
                     Believing that Sanderson might apply to him again for information on other
                     signers TJ asks Du Ponceau about Sanderson and his purpose: "What is his
                     character moral and political, does he write for money or fame, etc?
                     Information as to these particulars must govern my confidences ...." TJ
                     promises to burn Du Ponceau's reply as soon as he has received it.</p>

              T. J. says that due to his age and "the crippled state of both my hands, writing is become too difficult and slow for me to undertake any correspondence."

                     about the return of his "fine Borda's Circle of Reflection" and his best
                     telescope, since he has given them to the University of Virginia.
                     Böÿe was in Philadelphia "attending the engraver of his map"
                     of Virginia for which Jefferson had lent the instruments.</p>

                     ballad, The King of France, this copy is a fragment of an old English ballad,
                     Valentine and Ursine or Valentine and Orson, which is printed in Bishop Thomas
                     Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry as number 12 in his 3rd series, book
                     3. In his catalogue of 1783, Jefferson lists Percy's work as one of the volumes
                     he intended to purchase. <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">[2334]</bibref></p>

                     First and second floor plans for a square residence with north and south
                     porticoes, wings connected to the main building by arcades; ink drawings.
                     Students of Jeffersonian architecture have identified these drawings as (1)
                     tentative studies for the President's House and (2) tentative studies for the
                     Governor's House at Richmond. (See Fiske Kimball's article cited above). It may
                     be noted that the one parlor shown occupies less than one ninth of the first
                     floor, which is largely occupied by bedrooms, a nursery, etc.--a much simpler
                     plan than that of the Governor's House at Williamsburg--suggesting that this
                     plan may be for an unidentified country residence. <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">[2336, N-281,
