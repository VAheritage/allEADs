            project of the University of Virginia; on March 25, 1998,

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of twenty-seven items, chiefly
         letters written to Henry A. Bitner of Shippensburg, Franklin
         County, Pennsylvania, May 17, 1861 to May 25, 1863. Civilian
         and Union soldier friends of Bitner (who was apparently a
         school teacher) wrote the twenty-two letters from Maryland,
         Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia. The major
         correspondents are: Dave [David] R. P. Shoemaker (Company E,
         11th Regiment Ohio Volunteers; eight letters); Alex "Little
         Ellic" Cressler (a Chambersburg, Pennsylvania civilian (who died 1861 October 14); five
         letters); Thad Donnelly (Company D, 130th Pennsylvania
         Volunteer Infantry; four letters); William H. Kindig (Company
         B, 107th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, two letters); Henry
         T. Daihl (Company A, 77th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, one
         letter).</p>
      <p>They discuss several Civil War battles, personal and public
         incidents, and personalties. The correspondents describe the
         battles [followed by the date of the letter which discuss
         them] of Rich Mountain, Virginia (July 15, 1861), First
         Manassas, or First Bull Run (July 30, 1861), Cedar Mountain
         (August 13, 1862), and South Mountain (October 18, 1862).
         Prominent Union generals and civilians mentioned include:
         Nathaniel Banks (1816-1894) Jacob D. Cox (1828-1900); George
         Crook (1828-1890); Andrew G. Curtin (1817-1894); Abram Duryee
         (1815-1890); Elmer Ephraim Ellsworth (1837-1861); John Charles
         Fremont (1813-1890); George B. McClellan (1826-1885); Irvin
         McDowell (1818-1885); Robert Patterson (1792-1881); John Pope
         (1822-1892); William S. Rosencrans (1819-1898); and George D.
         Wise (?-?). Several minor Union officers are also mentioned by
         name. Prominent Confederate officers discussed or mentioned by
         Bitner's correspondents include: Braxton Bragg (1817-1876);
         Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson (1824-1863); Joseph E. Johnston
         (1807-1891); John Hunt Morgan (1825- 1864).</p>
      <p>Several letters or their envelopes contain colored
         patriotic images as well as camp news, battle and march
         rumors, and family news. Information of special interest
         includes a detailed description of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania
         (June 18, 1861); soldiers badly missing the company of women
         (January 18, 1862 and February 22, 1863); the high cost of
         apples (January 5, 1862); an envelope poem "The Bravest Home"
         (August 13, 1862); a visit to Baltimore and Washington, D.C.
         (August 20, 1862); life as a Confederate prisoner of war
         (October 18 and November 26, 1862;); a sexually suggestive
         poem ("What") post February 3, 1863; a discussion of marriage
         and the merits and drawbacks of bachelorhood, and a soldier's
         naming of his new rifle (March 21, 1863); and criticism of the
         Army of the Potomac (Union) by a member of the Army of the
         Cumberland (Union) (May 9, 1863). Also present are three
         envelopes addressed to Bitner; their contents are missing.</p>

                  hearing a report that General George B. McClellan
                  "has defeated the Secessionists" [battle of Rich
                  Mountain, Virginia, July 11, 1861]; mentions a
                  petition on Bitner's behalf; in a postscript he
                  mentions that an uncle quotes Major General Robert
                  Patterson as assuring him "that if Johnson did not
                  attack him that he (Patterson) would attack Johnson

                  passing reference to Union General George D. Wise [a

                  destination unknown; sends respects to HAB's wife
                  Katie; misses the nightly company of the opposite sex
                  ("How I wish that instead of lying down to-night with
                  my cold and bony masculine bed-fellows, and being
                  bothered by those parasites which even poor soldiers

                  address future letters to Cincinnati, Ohio; first
                  postscript says the regiment's destination is
                  Cumberland Ford, Kentucky; second postscript (in

                  attack expected from Confederate General Braxton
                  Bragg; mentions captures and attacks against Union
                  soldiers; expresses his appreciation of a new rifle:
                  "Our regiment was today furnished with bran new
                  Norfolk Rifles [Springfield pattern] I am quite proud
                  of mine, which I call 'Katie Darling' and I am
