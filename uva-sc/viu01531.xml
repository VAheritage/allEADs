      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>These five letters, 1862-1865, were written by various
         Union soldiers stationed in Virginia and Alabama during the
         Civil War. They describe camp life and the aftermath of
         battles.</p>
      <p>Four were written in Virginia at Alexandria, Harrison's
         Landing, Stevensburg and Vienna. The first, 2 May 1862, is
         from James Batcheler, 26th New York Volunteers, Camp Lyons,
         Alexandria, to his brother. Batcheler, who says "I like
         soldiering first rate," discusses in passing family matters,
         friends, and identifies his camp as being near the south side
         of the Potomac River. His regiment has served half of its
         enlistment, and he promises to send two-thirds of his pay
         home.</p>
      <p>Second Lieutenant Andrew S. Eagleson, 8th Pennsylvania
         Reserves, 
         <emph render="super">1</emph>complains to his aunt about his
         lack of mail, camp sickness and mosquitoes on 6 August 1862.
         Writing from Harrison's Landing, he also describes a
         Confederate attack against the camp [July 31] and shelling by
         rebel gunboats. Eagleson notes the arrival of 200 contrabands 
         <emph render="super">2</emph>[August 4] who were put to work
         building breastworks and praises Generals Joseph Hooker
         [1814-1879], Philip Kearny [1814-1862], and Darius Couch
         [1822-1897] as "fighting generals."</p>
      <p>Edwin A. Lane, writing from Vienna to an aunt on 9 April
         1863, describes the town and the hardships suffered by a local
         Unionist tavern keeper at the hands of rebels. He discusses a
         march in a snowstorm [April 7], the capture of three
         Confederates, one of whom is a mail carrier who will probably
         be hanged, the capture of at least 80 of John Singleton
         Mosby's [1833-1916] guerrillas, and complains that he and his
         fellow soldiers have not been paid for three months and are
         actually owed five months' pay. Lane describes a contraband
         village and contrabands as "a very fine looking lot of
         fellows," illiterate but hard workers, especially as clothes
         washers. Two North Carolina contrabands are hailed as skilled
         banjo and tambourine players. Lane concludes with praise of
         General Hooker.</p>
      <p>P. Paul, writing from Stevensburg on 3 March 1864 to a
         friend named Harrison, is upset about the lack of news from
         home but says his regiment's health is good. He reviews
         General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick's raid [the Kilpatrick-Dahlgren
         raid on Richmond, 28 February--4 March 1864] and hopes he will
         soon liberate Union prisoners of war in Richmond. Paul
         mentions visit by a Mr. Sprouls(?), secretary of the Union
         League 
         <emph render="super">3</emph>in West Finley [Pennsylvania] and
         a review of the II Corps [Army of the Potomac] by General
         George G. Meade [1815-1872] and Vice-President Hannibal Hamlin
         [1809- 1891], "a most Splendid looking man as I ever saw."
         Paul disapproves of an army dance (held on 22 February) as
         being useless in putting down the rebellion.</p>
      <p>The final letter (with envelope) in the collection is from
         Joseph C. Arnold, 96th Battalion, Ohio Volunteer Infantry,
         Mobile, Alabama, to his sister, Mrs. Rebecca Bery, Scottstown,
         Marion County, Ohio. In bivouac on 24 June 1865, Arnold
         informs her that the regiment has two months duty remaining
         and is ordered to Texas. 
         <emph render="super">4</emph>The men are healthy thanks to an

         July 1865.</p>
