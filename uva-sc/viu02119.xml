      <p>According to James I. Robertson's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">18th Virginia Infantry</title>, Elam
         was an Appomattox County merchant who was mustered into
         Confederate service on May 7, 1861, with the rank of corporal.
         He was promoted to First Sergeant in May, 1862, was wounded at
         the Battle of Frayser's Farm on June 30, 1862, and was wounded
         and captured at the Battle of Gettysburg on July 3, 1863. He
         was exchanged and eventually promoted to First Lieutenant on
         May 27, 1864, but was again captured, this time at Sayler's
         Creek on April 6, 1865, and imprisioned at Johnson's Island
         Military Prison from April 19 to June 15, 1865, when he was
         released on parole.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of twenty-five items, 1861-1865,
         mostly letters from Lieutenant William Robert Elam of Company
         H, "Appomattox Grays," Eighteenth Virginia Infantry, to Sallie
         E. Andrews of Columbia, Tennessee (usually addressed as
         "Sallie," "Friend," or "Cousin").</p>
      <p>Elam's letters describe his life as a soldier and discuss
         his wounds and promotions, camp life, marching, and other
         activities; he writes from various localities in Virginia
         including Centreville, Winchester, Richmond, and Bermuda
         Hundred; and Appomattox, Berkeley, and Hanover counties, as
         well as Kinston, North Carolina, and Johnson's Island in
         Sandusky Bay, Ohio. He mentions the participation of his
         regiment in the following battles: South Mountain, Antietam,
         Frayser's Farm (where he and his brother, John J. Elam, were
         wounded on September 25, 1862); Williamsburg, Seven Pines,
         Gaines' Mill, Second Manassas, Frederick, Maryland (September
         30, 1862); Gettysburg (October 12, 1863); Cold Harbor (June 1,
         1864); and Sayler's Creek. He also mentions other battles and
         events such as a fire in Charleston, South Carolina (December
         14, 1861); the Battle of Dranesville, Virginia (December 24,
         1861); Fort Henry (February 4, 1862); and the execution of two
         soldiers for threatening to kill their officers (December 14,
         1861).</p>
      <p>In letters from Johnson's Island, he reflects on the war
         and its outcome (June 15, 1865), his hopes for release, and
         mentions he is only allowed to write twenty-eight lines per
         letter according to prison regulations (April 20, 1865).
         Prominent men mentioned in the correspondence include: Pierre
         G. T. Beauregard, Ambrose Burnside, John B. Hood, Eppa Hunton,
         Robert E. Lee, Abraham Lincoln, and William T. Sherman.</p>
      <p>Also present is a July 24, 1864, pass for Sarah ("Sallie")
         Andrews signed by Colonel John T. Wilder (1830-1917) of the
         Seventeenth Indiana Infantry; on its reverse is a handwritten
         note by Andrews (?) stating that she is confining herself to
         home and will not take the "oath" until obligated to do so.
         There is also an undated note from Helen A. Thomson of
         Florence, Alabama in which she forwards a letter from Andrews
         to Elam and volunteers to act as a go-between for the
         forwarding of their letters to each other. Three numbered
         envelopes addressed to Andrews from Elam are also present.</p>
