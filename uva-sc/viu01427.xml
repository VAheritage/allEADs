         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection consists of the fifteen letters of Ruth
         Anderson to Naomi Wallace, 1945-1955, written from stations in
         post-war Europe where Anderson had been assigned by the State
         Department. She worked for the U.S. Political Advisor on
         Austrian Affairs, Mediterranean Theater of Operations, U.S.
         Army. A photograph of Anderson is included. In several
         "reports" to her friends back home, Anderson describes her
         voyage in June 1945, on the 
         <title render="italic">Motorship Gripsholm</title>from New
         York to Naples, the drive on to Caserta; and the journey north
         from Caserta, Italy to Vienna.</p>
         <p>According to information in the letters, Anderson left New
         York City on May 31, 1945, and docked at Naples and was taken
         to Caserta, Italy, on June 13. She reported to work in Caserta
         on June 14, and remained there until June 22, when she left on
         her journey to Vienna, Austria.</p>
         <p>While on board the 
         <title render="italic">Gripsholm</title>, Anderson describes
         in a letter to (her sister?) "Es," written on June 9, 1945,
         with an addendum on June 16, her stateroom and cabin mate,
         Caroline Wadsworth ("Wendy"); the advantage of being the only
         person aboard who can speak Swedish with the crew, who made
         the whole ship available for her to explore; other passengers,
         including the oil men going to Saudi Arabia, missionaries en
         route to India, and State Department and Foreign Service
         people (ca. 1945 June 12).</p>
         <p>She writes a four page summary, ca. June 19, 1945, of the
         voyage over on the 
         <title render="italic">Gripsholm</title>, sailing from New
         York City on May 31, 1945, and reaching Naples on June 13th.
         The ship carried about 900 Italian and Greek deportees, all of
         whom had served at least a year in jail. Anderson jokingly
         says that somehow they managed to arrive at Naples with only
         two non-fatal stabbings to their credit. After disembarking at
         Naples, Anderson was whisked away to Caserta, Italy. She
         includes a detailed description of her living quarters, social
         interactions, a visit to the villa of the American Ambassador
         Alexander C. Kirk on June 16, attending the Palace Opera House
         on June 17, and the wonderful cuisine that she enjoyed during
         her meals, especially in Naples at the Villa Galotti on the
         18th.</p>
         <p>A second four page summary letter describes her adventures
         leaving Caserta on Friday, June 22, 1945, with several other
         government employees, in two Studebaker Commander "Skyway"
         sedans, traveling on the shore road from Caserta to Rome, and
         the events on her drive to Rome. She remarks on the efficient
         draining of the Pontine Marshes by Benito Mussolini, the Anzio
         beachhead, the bombed-out villages and other evidences of the
         recent conflict along the road, and the tourist sights in
         Rome.</p>
         <p>They stayed in Rome overnight, leaving early the next day
         (Saturday) in order to reach Leghorn by lunchtime. They
         enjoyed dinner in Florence and continued their drive over the
         mountains, where they could plainly see the results of the
         enemy's opposition to the arrival of the men of the Tenth
         Mountain and the 88th Division (Blue Devils). Stopping briefly
         in Bologna at the Army Information Center to refuel, they did
         not arrive at the Colombo d' Oro in Verona until 2:30 Sunday
         morning, on June 24th. Later on that Sunday, they attended a
         party at General Mark Clark's villa on Lake Garda, which
         Anderson describes in detail, including a glimpse of General
         Clark surfboarding (attached to letter dated June 30, 1945).
         At Verona, Anderson worked at the 15th Army Group
         Headquarters.</p>
         <p>Her next letter, August 7, 1945, written at Verona, Italy,
         discusses her weekend vacation at Lake Como and her pleasure
         about Naomi's marriage to Wayne Wallace.</p>
         <p>A letter written from Vienna, ca. 1945 December-1946
         January, discusses her work at the U.S. Consulate in great
         detail, where she is helping with the registration of American
         citizens, by keeping the appointments for registration and
         oaths, and reviewing the applications for correctness and
         completeness. She also answers questions for Austrian
         employees and visitors to the Consulate and is the custodian
         of the Red Cross food parcels distributed monthly to American
         citizens. Some of the parcels had been stolen or sliced open
         to take out the cigarettes for sale on the black market in
         Vienna. Her other duties which she includes under the term
         "welfare work" involved helping Displaced Persons, refugees
         from Central Europe, each with a story of suffering and
         hardship. Anderson also describes her twelve-day leave to
         Paris taken after Christmas with Nancy Jenks.</p>
         <p>A letter from [1947?] discusses the rumors about Soviet
         attempts to have Austria partitioned, the desperate food
         situation in Austria despite the fact that the United States
         is pouring food into the country, and problems resulting from
         drought. In another letter, September 19, 1947, she
         congratulates Naomi on the arrival of a son, Douglas. Another
         letter written about 1947, describes her work with
         repatriating American citizens and the procedures she follows,
         and gives her impressions of the people of Denmark, Sweden,
         and Germany, which was formed during her vacation trip last
         September.</p>
         <p>By 1951, Ruth Anderson was posted to London, Great Britain,
         in the Notarial, Consular Invoice, and Shipping Section, where
         she complains that she does not have the opportunity to use
         her languages or learn any new ones. She goes on to describe
         her flat and housekeeper in great detail (1951 Sep 8).</p>
         <p>Other topics in the letters include low morale as a result
         of changes in the Foreign Service [1952 Dec], a trip home to
         the United States (1954 Oct 8), and a letter from a later post
         in Hong Kong (1955 Jan 2) where she mentions Christmas
         celebrations, the view from her hotel room, and Hong Kong
         itself, especially the contrast between the rich and poor.</p>
