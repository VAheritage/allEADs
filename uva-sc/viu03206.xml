        <p>This collection was purchased by the Library from Arthur
            Wood of Charlottesville, Virginia, on November 24, 1941,
            and is unrestricted.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists primarily of ca. 125 business and
         family letters, 1877-1899, and 1917, to and from members of
         the George L. (d. 1883) and Mary C. Sively family of Mountain
         Grove, Bath County, Virginia, and miscellaneous papers.
         Included are letters from Sallie (Sively) Erwin written while
         a student at Hollins Institute and after her marriage to Dr.
         James E. Erwin, describing her migrations from Barboursville,
         West Virginia, to Hazleton, Kansas, and to Coal Creek,
         Tennessee</p>
      <p>There is also considerable correspondence between Mary C.
         Sively and her sister, Elizabeth B. Skeen of Franklin County,
         Virginia, and her family concerning their common interest in
         the rental or sale of the "old homeplace" and farm, which was
         apparently willed to them following their father's death in
         1873. The sisters had trouble with delinquent renters,
         trespassers and timber cutters who wanted to cut off the
         timber from their land without recompense (1888 Jul 9).</p>
      <p>Other items of note include: a description of the town of
         Alderson, West Virginia, where one son attended the school of
         H.B. Laird (1878 Sep 25); the mention of the hanging of two
         blacks for arson (1890 Aug 23); mention of the anticipation
         and excitement of the opening of the Cherokee Strip just six
         miles south of Sallie Erwin's home and a description of
         members of her family staking out their claims (1893 Mar 17
         &amp; Oct 10); the lynching of a black at Warm Springs (1893
         Mar 17); a severe drought in the Cherokee Strip area and the
         general discouragement of the people with prospects in Kansas
         (1894 Aug 31); financial losses of Elizabeth Skeen due to the
         failure of the Rocky Mount Bank (1895 May 22); and letters
         from family members attending Berea College, Berea, Kentucky
         (1917).</p>
      <p>The miscellaneous papers consists of business accounts,
         school reports, a rental agreement, and advertisements.</p>
