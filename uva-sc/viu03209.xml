      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection includes business and personal
         correspondence; financial papers, such as accounts, receipts,
         notes, and bound financial volumes; legal papers, primarily
         land deeds, wills, and indentures; miscellaneous writings,
         such as poems, essays, and diaries; newspaper clippings,
         boardsides; photographs; and memorabilia. The early
         nineteenth-century material focuses primarily on a mercantile
         company in Fredericksburg, Virginia, that had both foreign and
         domestic trade, and the later material on family matters of
         the Bryans, Tuckers, and Grinnans. Topics mentioned include
         the Civil war; business matters, such as the purchase and sale
         of lands; and family slaves. Although letters of several
         politically prominent figures are included in the collection,
         most are of a personal nature and do not mention political
         affairs.</p>
      <p>The correspondence spans the years 1740 to 1935 and
         includes both business and personal letters. The business
         correspondence falls primarily between the years 1790 and 1827
         and centers around the firms of Grinnan and Mundell, and
         Murray, Grinnan and Mundell, flour merchants in
         Fredericksburg, and direct successors of pre-and
         post-Revolutionary enterprises operated under the names of
         Mitchell, Gray, Coates, and Mundell. Most of the letters are
         orders for merchandise, particularly flour, and are from
         merchants in Richmond, Norfolk, and Alexandria, Virginia; New
         York; Kingston, Jamaica; and Liverpool and Glasgow in Great
         Britain.</p>
      <p>Business letters to Daniel Grinnan, Jr., of Grinnan and
         Mundell date from 1798 to 1827, and include letters from
         William Fleming of Glasgow, Scotland; Brown Rives and Company
         of Richmond; Reuben Crump of New York; Walter Colquhoun of
         Glasgow, Scotland; George Brown and Company of Glasgow,
         Scotland, and James Brown of Richmond.</p>
      <p>Daniel Grinnan, Jr., was born in Culpeper County, Virginia,
         on April 19, 1771. He moved to Fredericksburg in 1792 and
         became a clerk for a merchant, James Somerville. At
         Somerville's death around 1798, Grinnan was appointed his
         executor and succeeded to the business. In 1800, the firm of
         Murray, Grinnan, and Mundell was founded and counting houses
         and warehouses were established in both Fredericksburg and
         Norfolk. Much of the firm's trade was foreign and they were
         agents for the Argentine Confederation in their way with
         Spain.</p>
      <p>Business correspondence of Murray, Grinnan, and Mundell
         dates from 1802 to 1815, the principal correspondent being
         George Murray and Co. of Norfolk, Virginia (1801-1813). A
         third group of business letters to John Mundell from 1790 to
         1823 is also present, which regard Mundell's personal
         business. Several of these letters pertain to the will of
         Thomas Miller, for whose estate Mundell was executor.</p>
      <p>The personal correspondence dates from 1790 to 1935 and is
         mainly between members of the Bryan, Tucker, and Grinnan
         families. The three families were related through marriage,
         and approximately five generations are represented in this
         collection. The letters usually concern family matters but
         sometimes include mention of contemporary political
         events.</p>
      <p>Major correspondents include St. George Tucker, John
         Coalter, Frances Bland Coalter, John Randolph of Roanoke,
         Elizabeth Tucker Coalter Bryan, John Randolph Bryan, Robert
         Alexander Grinnan, Andrew Glassell Grinnan, Cornelia Grinnan,
         St. George Tucker Bryan, Corbin Braxton Bryan, Daniel Grinnan,
         Nina Stuart Grinnan, Randolph Bryan Grinnan, and Georgia
         Screven Bryan.</p>
      <p>Several of the correspondents listed above held political
         office or were instrumental in the formation of political
         ideas of their time. For example, St. George Tucker
         (1752-1827), a contemporary of Thomas Jefferson, held many
         legal and political offices during his lifetime. (Consult the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">DAB</title>) He was married in 1778 to
         Frances Bland Randolph, the mother of John Randolph of Roanoke
         by a previous marriage. Frances and St. George had several
         children before and died in 1788, among them Frances "Fanny"
         Bland (b. 1779).</p>
      <p>All of the correspondence of St. George Tucker, with the
         exception of one letter, is with John Coalter (Tucker's
         son-in-law), Frances Bland s Coalter (Tucker's daughter), and
         Elizabeth Tucker Coalter (Tucker's granddaughter). Most of the
         letters contain news of family and friends, but those from
         1814 to 1815 include discussions of the War of 1812 and
         Tucker's plans for escape from Williamsburg before the enemy's
         arrival. Tucker's letter to Joseph C. Cabell dated December
         30, 1814, discusses in depth the economic state of Virginia
         during the war, specifically as it pertained to the Bank of
         Virginia.</p>
      <p>John Coalter, St. George Tucker's son-in-law, was a
         prominent attorney in Virginia. Born on August 20, 1771, he
         was a tutor in the family of St. George Tucker and studied law
         at William and Mary College. He settled near Staunton to
         practice law, and later was appointed attorney for the
         commonwealth. In 1809, he was appointed a judge of the general
         court, and two years later was promoted to the court of
         appeals. Shortly after 1821, he purchased "Chatham," in
         Stafford County, and resided there until his death on February
         2, 1838. Coalter was married three times, to Maria Rind of
         Williamsburg, to Margaret Davenport of Williamsburg, and
         finally to Frances Bland Tucker, daughter of St. George
         Tucker.</p>
      <p>Most of Coalter's correspondence is with St. George Tucker
         and Fanny Bland Coalter. The letters usually pertain to family
         and friends, with the exception of the letters from St. George
         Tucker during 1814 and 1815 mentioned previously. Of interest
         are three letters written by Joseph C. Cabell to John Coalter
         (1819, 1824) concerning legal and financial matters, and four
         letters from William Wirt (1816, 1819, n.d.), one of which
         discusses the ratification of the treaty between the United
         States and Spain for the cession of Florida.</p>
      <p>The correspondence of John Randolph of Roanoke in this
         collection consists of fifteen letters, dated 1813 to 1831,
         primarily to or from John Randolph Bryan, his godson and
         namesake, and Elizabeth Tucker (Coalter) Bryan, Bryan's wife
         and Randolph's niece. One letter, April 10, 1826, written by
         John Randolph to Dr. Brockenbrough, proctor of the University
         of Virginia, discusses a closed Senate session and includes an
         anecdote about fellow Senate member William Henry Harrison.
         Another letter, dated December 13, 1813, from Randolph to
         "Tudor," describes Randolph's, strained relationship with his
         step-father and his fondness for his brothers.</p>
      <p>The correspondence of John Randolph Bryan spans the years
         1819 to 1887 and includes letters to or from various members
         of his family. Bryan was married to Elizabeth Tucker Coalter,
         daughter of John Coalter and Frances Bland (Tucker) Coalter.
         They resided at "Eagle Point," on the Severn River in Virginia
         from 1830 until 1862, when the estate was broken up by the
         war. In addition to his family, correspondents of Bryan's
         include John Randolph of Roanoke and John Tyler. The
         correspondence with Randolph is primarily of a personal nature
         and the letter from John Tyler concerns a visit he was to make
         to Bryan's home.</p>
      <p>Andrew Glassell Grinnan was born in Fredericksburg on
         August 14, 1827, the son of Daniel Grinnan, Jr., and his
         second wife Helen Buchan Glassell. He graduated from the
         University of Pennsylvania in medicine in 1848 and practiced
         at Madison Court House, Virginia, until 1859, when he married
         and moved to his estate, "Brampton," near Rapidan Station,
         Madison County, Virginia. After his marriage to Georgia
         Screven Bryan on June 2, 1859, at "Eagle's Point," Gloucester
         County, Virginia, he gave up medicine for business
         interests.</p>
      <p>The correspondence of Andrew Grinnan consists of about 650
         letters, mostly with members of his family. Of particular
         interest are the letters written during the Civil War, which
         pertain primarily to family matters, but illustrate everyday
         life during the war. Little mention is made of particular
         battles, but copies of letters from J.E.B. Stuart to Ella
         Grinnan (Andrew's sister) and Georgia Grinnan refer to his
         camp at "Brampton" during the Civil War.</p>
      <p>Many of Grinnan's letters between 1848 and 1859 deal with
         the practice of medicine. Later, after Grinnan retired from
         medicine, much of his correspondence details his purchases of
         land, particularly in Iowa, and his investments in copper and
         coal mining in southwest Virginia. Other personal business
         correspondence involves the hiring or sale of slaves which he
         or member of his family owned. Notable correspondents of
         Andrew Grinnan include Jedediah Hotchkiss, Jeremiah Morton,
         James L. Kempler, J.J. Halsey, and Matthew Fontaine Maury.
         Andrew Grinnan died on May 9, 1902.</p>
      <p>Another major correspondent in the Grinnan collection,
         Corbin Braxton Bryan, was born at "Eagle's Point" on April 17,
         1852. He entered the department of engineering at the
         University of Virginia in 1871 and four years later entered
         the Theological Seminary of the Protestant Episcopal Church
         near Alexandria, Virginia. He was ordained deacon in June
         1878, and afterwards served various Episcopal churches in
         Virginia. His correspondence dates from 1870 to 1898 and is
         primarily with his sister Georgia and her children. The
         letters regard family matters and the development of his own
         career. Bryan died in 1922 at the age of 70.</p>
      <p>Another group of interesting letters includes those written
         by Randolph Bryan Grinnan, son of Andrew and Georgia Grinnan,
         to his family while he was a Presbyterian missionary in Japan
         between 1886 and 1898. He describes Japanese customs and
         attitudes toward Christianity.</p>
      <p>Also included in the collection is a transcript of a letter
         dated January 31, 1800, from Thomas Jefferson to Bishop James
         Madison.</p>
      <p>The names of minor correspondents, along with the dates
         ranges of their correspondence, are listed in Appendix B.
         Dates of the letters of the major correspondents are listed in
         Appendix A. For a detailed listing of all of the
         correspondence in the collection, refer to the Grinnan family
         card index. A partial family tree of members of the families
         represented in this collection can also be found attached to
         this guide.</p>
      <p>The legal papers, 1786 to 1881, include wills, land deeds,
         contracts, leases, and statements regarding legal trials. Most
         of the legal material from before 1850 concerns the mercantile
         company Murray, Grinnan, and Mundell or consists of the
         personal legal papers of George Murray, Daniel Grinnan, or
         John Mundell. Later legal material is primarily that of Andrew
         Grinnan. Many of his legal papers are land deeds to property
         he purchased in Iowa, Kansas, Virginia, West Virginia, and
         Minnesota after the Civil War. Also included are documents
         regarding the sale of exchange of slaves by members of his
         family. A pardon issued to Andrew G. Grinnan by Andrew Johnson
         in 1865 for his participation in the Civil War in present, as
         well as a transcript of James Madison's last will and
         testament, April 15, 1835.</p>
      <p>In addition, there is a group of land grants, deeds,
         contracts, bonds, and wills of members of the Cruncleton,
         Seashols, Scholl, and Shull families, forbears of Elizabeth
         Grinnan Jackson. The documents originated in Lancaster County,
         Bucks County, and Franklin County, Pennsylvania. A detailed
         listing of these items is located in control folder
         #1716-a.</p>
      <p>The financial papers consist of the records of the
         mercantile company Murray, Grinnan, and Mundell which include
         personal records, primarily receipts and accounts, of George
         Murray, Daniel Grinnan, and John Mundell; receipts and
         accounts of members of the Grinnan family; and papers relating
         to the estates of several individuals, including John
         Taliaferro Lewis, Alexander Nairne, Charles Pitt Howard,
         Walter Colquhoun, and Frances Burnley, The executor of these
         estates in most instances was either John Mundell, George
         Murray, or Daniel Grinnan. In addition, several bound
         financial volumes, primarily cashbooks of individuals or
         journals of Murray, Grinnan, and Mundell are located in this
         section.</p>
      <p>Also included in the financial papers in a group of papers
         relating to a suit of Daniel Grinnan, Walter Colquhoun, and
         James Somerville, executors of James Somerville, deceased, who

         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Eighteenth Century Index</title>of
         papers in the University of Virginia Manuscripts
         Department.)</p>
      <p>The next series includes various types of manuscripts. The
         first section is comprised of diaries. The earliest dated
         1716, is a nineteenth-century transcript of a now-published
         diary kept by John Fontaine, a member of the 1716 "Knights of
         the Golden Horseshoe" expedition led by Governor Alexander
         Spotswood up the James River into the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
      <p>Another item of particular interest is a diary dated 1825,
         of Major James McMillan Glassell, in which he described a
         visit to England and France. Glassell was born in 1790 in
         Madison County, Virginia, the son of Andrew Glassell and
         Elizabeth Taylor. He was appointed ensign in the United States
         Army in 1812 and served on the Great Lakes during the War of
         1812. The trip referred to in his diary began on August 16,
         1825, when he left New York for Liverpool on the steamboat 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Nautillus</title>. He traveled from
         Liverpool to Doncaster in the West Riding of Yorkshire and
         attended the Doncaster Races, of which he gives a vivid
         description. Several months later, he and his companions
         visited Lafayette at La Grange for two days, a description of
         which is included in this diary. Also in this section is a
         separate register of military letters written by James M.
         Glassell which is undated, but may have possibly been written
         during the 1820's or 1830's.</p>
      <p>Included in the miscellaneous writings are an 1846
         inventory of household articles at "Carysbrook"; "Whaling in
         Yosa, Japan," an essay by Randolph Bryan Grinnan; an essay by
         Bessie Grinnan on the capture by Indians of Francis Madison
         Hite, an ancestor of James Madison; and an essay concerning
         Masonry. Also present are notes regarding genealogy, probably
         kept by Cornelia Grinnan; and mathematics and French
         textbooks. Poems and religious memoranda left by Helen Grinnan
         are also present. The plats and surveys are mostly of lands in
         Iowa, in which Andrew Grinnan was interested.</p>
      <p>Broadsides, circular letters, newspaper clippings, and
         miscellaneous printed material comprise the printed material
         section. Among the broadsides are an 1849 advertisement for
         slave life insurance and an 1895 announcement of the Brampton
         Home School for young ladies, run by Mrs. Andrew g. Grinnan
         and daughters. The newspaper clippings are primarily
         obituaries of members of the Grinnan family.</p>
      <p>The last series consists of photographs and memorabilia.
         There are three 1908 views of Judge John Coalter's home, "Bush
         Hill," near Richmond, Virginia, and an 1898 photograph of Sam
         Pryor, a former slave who had originally resided in Albemarle
         County but later moved to Alabama.</p>
      <p>An engraving of Chapman Johnson, signed on the verso by G.
         N. Johnson is also included. The memorabilia includes various
         items, among which are a lithograph of John Randolph of
         Roanoke's dying words, calling cards, a Japanese wedding
         invitation, and a Japanese broadside banning Christianity in
         Japan.</p>
