      <p>Charles Wright was born in Pickwick Dam, Hardin County,
         Tennessee on August 25, 1935, to Charles Penzel and Mary
         Castleman (Winter) Wright, and was educated at Davidson
         College (B.A., 1957), the University of Iowa Writer's Workshop
         (M.F.A., 1963) and the University of Rome (1963-1964). He
         served in the United States Army Intelligence Corps,
         1957-1961, where he studied at the Army Language School,
         Monterey, California, the first year. He spent the remaining
         three years of service in and around Verona, Italy, returning
         there to study on a Fulbright grant in 1963-1964.</p>
      <p>Since 1966, Wright has been an English professor, first at
         the University of California, Irvine (1966-1983), and then at
         the University of Virginia (1983 until the present). He
         married Holly McIntire in 1969, and published his first book
         of poems, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Grave of the Right Hand</title>, in
         1970. Other titles of poetry include:

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of the papers of American poet and
         University of Virginia English professor, Charles Penzel
         Wright (1935 - ), ca. 5,000 items (38 Hollinger boxes, ca. 16
         linear shelf feet), ca. 1890- 1999, including manuscripts,
         poetry and translation notebooks kept by Charles Wright,
         professional and personal correspondence, photographs, printed
         material, news clippings, artwork, interviews, book reviews,
         and tape recordings.</p>
      <p>The correspondence files with other poets and literary
         persons and family, have been arranged by the last name of the
         correspondent (Boxes 1-17). The more frequent correspondents
         and correspondence with some of the other Pulitzer Prize
         winners in poetry have been placed in separate folders with
         the total number of letters noted in the guide.</p>
      <p>Correspondence with persons who have been awarded the
         Pulitzer Prize for Poetry include: John Ashbery (1 item),
         Louise Gluck (6 items), Jorie Graham (13 items), Anthony Hecht
         (1 item), Richard Howard (4 items), Donald Justice (142
         items), Galway Kinnell (3 items), Yusef Komunyakaa (1 item),
         Maxine Kumin (1 item), Philip Levine (207 items), William
         Meredith (3 items), W.S. Merwin (11 items), Lisel Mueller (1
         item), Charles Simic (31 items), James Tate (27 items), Robert
         Penn Warren (2 items), and Richard Wilbur (2 items).</p>
      <p>Other types of correspondence are arranged chronologically
         in a separate subseries B (Boxes 17-21). This includes
         correspondence about awards, conferences, workshops, poetry
         readings and other professional engagements, poems submitted
         to or accepted by poetry magazines and anthologies, and
         requests for Wright to judge poetry contests, write
         recommendations or evaluate candidates for academic positions;
         greeting cards; post cards; and invitations and
         announcements.</p>
      <p>Of special interest in series two containing manuscripts by
         Charles Wright are the twelve volumes of hand-written poetry
         kept by Wright in bound notebooks, from 1968 until the
         present. These contain his autograph poems in chronological
         order as they were written. When the poems were used in his
         published books, Wright would mark through them in pencil. The
         manuscript series also has an autograph volume for Wright's
         translation work and one called "Halflife ( A Commonplace
         Notebook)," where he has recorded quotes or his own thoughts
         about poetry and related subjects.</p>
      <p>Also present in a second subseries and arranged according
         to the title of the book, are typescripts, setting copies,
         page proofs, and galleys, for many of his published works,
         although some typescripts of early manuscripts had already
         been sold to private collectors in the early eighties prior to
         the acquisition of these papers by the Library.</p>
      <p>A third subseries contains copies of miscellaneous
         manuscripts by Charles Wright, including: a copy of his
         Masters Thesis submitted at the University of Iowa,
         typescripts and galleys of individual poems published in
         magazines such as 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The New Yorker</title>, and
         miscellaneous other manuscripts by Wright.</p>
      <p>A third series contains manuscripts by other authors sent
         to Wright for his comment or enjoyment and are arranged by the
         last name of the author. Most are not complete manuscripts of
         books by other authors, but when they are and the title of the
         book is known, it is included in the guide. Some are
         accompanied by letters from the authors, often discussing
         their work.</p>
      <p>Series four contains miscellaneous papers including:
         interviews and essays about Charles Wright, artwork by other
         people, biographical entries about Wright, contracts and
         publication agreements, a dissertation chapter about Wright,
         news clippings and printed, photographs, programs, reviews of
         books by Wright, royalties and honorariums, student papers
         about Wright, translations of Wright's poetry into Italian and
         German, interviews and poetry readings by Wright on audio
         tape, and oversize photographs, artwork, news clippings, dust
         jackets, and a Winter family genealogical chart.</p>
