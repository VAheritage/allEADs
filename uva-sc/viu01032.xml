      <p>These four collection consists of a total of 31 items
         (including ten letters) of 
         <persname>George Williams</persname>, a Civil War soldier from
         <geogname>Monroeville, Huron County, Ohio</geogname>, to his
         sister, 1863 &amp; 1865. Williams was a musician in 
         <corpname>Company B of the 123rd Ohio Regiment</corpname>and
         served in 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Maryland</geogname>. These letters and their
         typescripts (including multiple photocopies of photographs of
         Williams in uniform) have been interfiled chronologically with
         previous #11003 accessions. All letters, with the exception of
         January 1, 1865, are accompanied either by an envelope, a
         photocopy of a Williams photograph, or both.</p>
      <p>The majority of these Williams letters were written during
         1863 and addressed to his sister, Lill ( 
         <persname>Lillias Williams</persname>) while stationed in 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>( 
         <geogname>Martinsburg</geogname>, 
         <geogname>New Market Heights</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Petersburg</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Winchester</geogname>) and 
         <geogname>Sharpsburg</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Annapolis, Maryland</geogname>. Williams discusses
         personal, family, and war news. Members of his and other
         regiments such as the 
         <corpname>55th New Jersey Infantry</corpname>, the 
         <corpname>18th Connecticut</corpname>, and the 
         <corpname>34th Massachusetts Infantry</corpname>as well as
         various generals and prominent civilians, are mentioned by
         name: 
         <persname>Benjamin F. Butler</persname>[1818-1893]; 
         <persname>Ulysses S. Grant</persname>[1822-1885]; 
         <persname>Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson</persname>[1824-1863];
         <persname>Abraham Lincoln</persname>[1809-1865]; 
         <persname>William Starke Rosecrans</persname>[1819-1898]; 
         <persname>Philip H. Sheridan</persname>[1831-1888]; and 
         <persname>Edwin M. Stanton</persname>[1814-1869].</p>
      <p>On 3 June 1863, Williams writes to his sister from 
         <geogname>Winchester, Virginia</geogname>, with camp news
         including fact that 
         <persname>George Frith</persname>was not promoted (see letter
         of 26 July 1863) but 
         <persname>Edward L. Husted</persname>was promoted to rank of
         second lieutenant and quartermaster. Williams describes the
         accidental death by a gunshot wound to the head of Private
         Green [Crary Green, 31 May 1863] of Company C, due to
         discharge of a rifle being cleaned by a member of Company E:
         "It was a sad affair. The boy that shot him feels very bad
         about it."</p>
      <p>Two days later, 5 June 1863, he informs "Dear Friends" of
         return of members ("paroled boys") of the regiment captured at
         the battle of 
         <geogname>Winchester</geogname>and tells of an incompetent
         doctor who is petitioned by the men to resign or else: "I
         guess he will skedaddle if he dont he will get what he dont
         want." Williams mentions General 
         <persname>Ulysses S. Grant</persname>and the impending success
         of his army [the 
         <geogname>Vicksburg</geogname>siege] and the daily arrival of
         rebel deserters tired of the war and discouraged by the death
         of Confederate General 
         <persname>Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson</persname>.</p>
      <p>On 26 July 1863, while at 
         <geogname>Sharpsburg, Maryland</geogname>, Williams speaks
         well of the memory of a recently-deceased "General Frith"
         (First Sergeant 
         <persname>George J. Frith</persname>died as the result of
         wounds received at the battle of 
         <geogname>Winchester</geogname>on June 20, 1863) and describes
         events and aftermath of the battle of 
         <geogname>Winchester</geogname>(Second 
         <geogname>Winchester</geogname>, June 13-15, 1863) including
         the demoralization of the men and lack of discipline (most of
         the regiment was surrendered to the Confederates). However,
         nineteen rebel deserters were captured, took oaths of
         allegiance and were sent to 
         <geogname>Baltimore</geogname>. The stationery bears a color
         figure of a woman holding an American flag captioned "One Flag
         For The Whole County."</p>
      <p>On 14 August 1863, while at 
         <geogname>Martinsburg, Virginia</geogname>[now West Virginia]
         he characterizes its residents as destitute but Union troops
         "are living on the top shelf" and sampling an abundance of
         foods. Williams also notes that "it will soon be a year that I
         have been working for Uncle Samuel and the happyest year I
         ever spent take all things in consideration"; the troops have
         plenty of reading materials, including 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Harper's Weekly</title></bibref>, 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Frank Leslie's</title></bibref>, daily newspapers from 
         <geogname>Baltimore</geogname>, and dime novels--fifty are
         read in camp every day.</p>
      <p>Williams comments on distant yet relevant events on 29
         September 1863--the XI and XII Army Corps (and the 
         <corpname>55th New Jersey Infantry</corpname>) have passed
         through 
         <geogname>Martinsburg</geogname>by train to reinforce General 
         <persname>William Starke Rosecrans</persname>[who had
         retreated to Chattanooga, Tennessee, after his defeat at the
         battle of Chickamauga]. Most of the 
         <corpname>123rd Ohio</corpname>, including all of Company B
         except Williams and Joe [ 
         <persname>Joseph Sallabank</persname>], are guarding a bridge
         forty miles from 
         <geogname>Martinsburg</geogname>, but he and Joe "have got two
         drums and fifes so we make considerable noise."</p>
      <p>Williams continued to enjoy himself in 
         <geogname>Martinsburg</geogname>as evidenced by his letter to
         his sister of 12 November 1863. He attends church services
         with a "Virginia lady" named Florella, has lodgings with a
         local family, and claims 
         <geogname>Martinsburg</geogname>residents think the world of
         the Union soldiers and are "the finest people" he has ever
         met. In fact, life is so good in the town that it does not
         seem like he is in the army, and the food is so plentiful that
         if she were to see him eat "it would make your eyes water."
         The troops are well-dressed with paper collars and sutler
         shirts and musicians wear stripes on their pants; he claims
         that the 
         <corpname>18th Connecticut Infantry</corpname>is known as "the
         Mackerels."</p>
      <p>At the beginning of 1865 (1 January) he sends New Year's
         greetings to his sister from 
         <geogname>Petersburg, Virginia</geogname>. His regiment is
         assigned to the Army of the James [1st Brigade, 1st Division,
         Army of West Virginia attached to XXIV Army Corps] and has
         been building winter quarters; there is some discussion of
         family news but he complains: "It is so cold I cant hardly
         write." By 11 January he is at 
         <geogname>New Market Heights</geogname>and sends a description
         of the construction of camp quarters. There was "great
         excitement" due orders which offered thirty-day furloughs for
         one man in ten but this news was replaced with gloom following
         another order revoking it. General 
         <persname>Benjamin F. Butler</persname>has been removed from
         command and it is rumored that he will be replaced as
         commander of the Army of the James by General 
         <persname>Philip H. Sheridan</persname>. Meanwhile, Williams
         complains about delays in arrival of the company's band
         instruments and praises the band of the 
         <corpname>34th Massachusetts Infantry</corpname>.</p>
      <p>His letter of 19 March 1865, written at 
         <geogname>Camp Holly, Virginia</geogname>, reports that the
         regiment is assigned to the XXIV Army Corps, 1st Independent
         Division, (Army of the James) and its corps badge is a white
         heart. The corps was reviewed [17 March] by General Grant
         ("not a very good looking man as some others but that noble
         countenance denoted a man of good Princable and a perfect
         gentleman"), Secretary of War 
         <persname>Edwin M. Stanton</persname>("a Glasseyed old fellow
         not very prepossing") and various unnamed generals and ladies
         ("or they called them so"). Williams continues with news of
         camp activities, dress parades, an unaccustomed food shortage
         and hunger which is relieved by the issuing of potatoes and
         onions, and a lecture by a member of the 
         <corpname>U. S. Christian Commission</corpname>.</p>
      <p>From 
         <geogname>Annapolis, Maryland</geogname>, on 17 April 1865,
         William describes his capture on 6 April at the battle of 
         <geogname>High Bridge, Virginia</geogname>[near Farmville and
         the Appomattox River], the wounding of Captain 
         <persname>[John F.] Randolph</persname>, and the regiment's
         subsequent release and return to Union lines on the 9th after
         Lee's surrender at 
         <geogname>Appomattox</geogname>(during his captivity the
         rebels took all of Williams' private property and his fife).
         He mourns the assassination of President 
         <persname>Abraham Lincoln</persname>[1809-1865] and adds that
         the regiment is to report to 
         <geogname>Camp Chase, Ohio</geogname>, where he expects it
         will be mustered out.</p>
