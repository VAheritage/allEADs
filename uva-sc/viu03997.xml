              <p>Observes that the English are so enamored of Longfellow and his work that he (Hawthorne) has benefited from revealing their friendship and is sorry the poet is not coming soon to visit his devotees. Outlines his own plans to continue consular duties another year and then to spend a year or two on the Continent, made possible by supplementing his earnings in England with those from his writing. Then considers the later phases of a literary career, "Don't you think that the autumn may be the golden age both of the intellect and imagination?"  As Longfellow's work grew steadily "richer and deeper," he hopes his own will. Also finds beneficial for Americans a residence in England, exposed to more "simple and natural people" and to ale and mutton, which may all perhaps be discernable in his next novel. #6249-a.

              <p>Responding to Bennoch's intervening note, explaining that he and Mrs. Hawthorne were planning a three-months sojourn at Southport and that establishing the family there would preclude his accepting an invitation to Hereford, instead giving Bennoch instructions for visiting Southport. During that residence, Mrs. Hawthorne wishes to "try Miss Browne as governess," who, should she prove suitable, would be retained for service when they depart England, a prospect not yet to be discussed elsewhere. #6249-a.
