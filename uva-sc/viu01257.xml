      <p>The collection consists of letters to William Cabell Rives
         (1792-1868) from constituents, friends, and family members,
         ca. 1824-1842, and undated, ca. 190 items (1 Hollinger box),
         often discussing political matters on the local, state, and
         national level. William Cabell Rives was a Representative and
         Senator from Virginia, born at "Oak Ridge," Nelson County,
         Virginia. He attended Hampden-Sidney College and the College
         of William and Mary, graduating in 1809. Rives began to
         practice law in Charlottesville, about 1814, and served in the
         Virginia House of Delegates, 1817-1820, 1822-1823. Rives
         served in the U.S. Senate during 1823-1829, 1832-1834,
         1836-1845, and most of the correspondence in the collection
         was written to him while a Senator in Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>The papers also contain political essays, poetry, several
         news clippings and legal &amp; financial documents of the
         Rives family. The subjects of the political essays and papers
         include: "Opinion on the project of law of indirect taxes
         presented to the Chamber of Deputies on the 5th October 1830,"
         a petition to Congress concerning the Bankrupt Law, a table
         comparing the reduction of import duties on French wine with
         the volume of American cotton exported to France, amendments
         to Henry Clay's resolutions, "Outlines of a Plan for a fiscal
         agent of the Government," and "Notes on the subject of a Bank,
         a Fiscal Agent, of the United States."</p>
