</head>
      <p>Robert T. Canevari served as the Dean of Students at the University of Virginia from
                1970 to 1999. He also served as acting interim Vice President of Student Affairs
                (1993-1994.) Dean Canevari began his work at the University as a student in
                1955. He played football for the Cavaliers for two of his four years. He also served
                in the Army ROTC after graduating from the Education School in 1960. He became
                Assistant Dean of Students in 1965 under Dean B. F. D. Runk. Described as
                enthusiastic and caring, Dean Canevari had a gift of making students feel
                comfortable. Associate Dean of Students V. Shamim Sisson said of Canevari, "his most
                important contribution he has given over the years has been himself." He helped
                students during the Vietnam War protests and also through the continuing cultural
                changes in student life during an era of dramatic growth and diversification at the
                University. In 1984 the University showed their appreciation by giving him one of
                their highest honors, the Algernon Sydney Sullivan award which was given annually to
                a member of the University Community for their "high qualities of heart and mind" in
                serving the University. The citation read "As a loyal and trustworthy individual Mr.
                Canevari may always be relied upon for an honest opinion exhibiting a remarkable
                degree of empathy." He was also given an award by the Seven Society and had a
                scholarship established by former students and friends in his name to honor his
                contributions to the University. Canevari loved working with the students so much
                that he couldn't believe he was paid to do it.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection consists of correspondence of University of Virginia Dean of Students
                Robert T. Canevari, newspaper clippings about Canevari and his appearance on "A
                Closer Look" with Jane Pauley, and Office of the Dean of Students reports. Of
                interest is a letter from Amy Garrou, Assistant Dean of Admissions to the Society of
                Purple Shadows criticizing the use of their robes and hoods. There is a response
                from the Society defending their position to Dean Canevari. There are also notes
                from students, a card from the Society, and a paperback book titled, "The Shadow
                Laughs"</p>
      <p>There are also trophies and gifts from students and the University including an
                American Flag that was flown at the Capitol for Canevari in appreciation for his
                allowing the use of Newcomb Hall for the Virginia Congressional Delegation Academy
                Day on March 20, 1993. Other awards include the Algernon Sydney Sullivan plague, a
                resolution commending Canevari for his twenty nine years of service to the students
                of the University of Virginia and several trophies for his dedication to the
                University of Virginia. The collection is 167 items, one and half Hollinger boxes
                and one cubic and 2 linear feet.</p>

                            present (maybe the bow and arrow and quiver) from Santiago.</p>
