      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 1,000 items, ca. 1905-1994,
         pertaining to the life and career of Hugh Scott, and including
         biographical and personal information on Scott and his wife
         Marian Huntington Chase Scott. Included are correspondence,
         notes and other papers, magazine and newspaper clippings,
         printed documents and other material, and photographs.</p>
      <p>Correspondence, 1915-1926, includes letters between Hugh
         Scott, his brother Norman C. Scott and sister Alice Mitchell
         Scott, and their father, Hugh Doggett Scott, and his wife whom
         they address as "mother." The family letters are heartfelt and
         loving and usually concern news of the family and personal
         matters; the father's letters to his son are full of praise
         and show great pride. A letter, January 29, 1922, from Hugh
         Scott, 24 East Lawn, University of Virginia, comments on
         various topics: Hugh Black, the evangelist, speaking to the
         students; Melissa Bradford's graduating from Randolph Macon
         Women's College and visiting him at the university; and,
         twenty-five inches of snow in Charlottesville. Other topics
         mentioned include: a visit from Lloyd George and his family
         (November 5, 1923); the movie filmed in Fredericksburg, the
         "Steadfast Heart" (November 10, 1923); the upcoming marriage
         of Hugh Scott and Marian Huntington Chase (February 18, 1924);
         Hugh Scott's mother, Scott's intentions to marry Marian
         Huntington Chase, and movie actors at the Kiwanis Club (May
         23, 192[ ]); and, mid-winters at the University of Virginia
         (Wednesday).</p>
      <p>Correspondence, 1935-1986, includes letters between Hugh
         Scott, his brother Norman C. Scott and his wife Elizabeth Ann
         Scott, and the Scott brothers' parents. These letters contain
         discussion of Scott's career and travel activities. A letter,
         September 9, 1935, discusses a sensational investigation of
         the magistrates of the city of Philadelphia by the district
         attorney's office. A letter, May 21, 1939, on letterhead
         "Cunard White Star 'Georgic,'" details the travel plans of
         Hugh and Marian Scott and their daughter "Marnie" in and
         around Europe, and mentions stays in various cities of
         England, Scotland, Spain, Italy, Greece, and Yugoslavia. There
         are three letters, July-August 1941, from Scott onboard the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">U. S. S. New Mexico</title>, mentioning
         various activities on the ship, a ride in a seaplane, and the
         probability of being transferred to the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Mississippi</title>. Two letters in
         1945 from Scott discuss activities in the Pacific. The letter
         of July 5, 1945 discusses an impending operation in which
         Scott will have several vessels under his charge as press
         boats and his philosophical thoughts on the war. The letter of
         November 9, 1945, "en route Yokohama to Oahu," discusses his
         future plans including a brief stay in Pearl, [Hawaii] and
         doing a job in Washington at the request of the admiral;
         mentions his thoughts on the tour and the ship 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Calvert</title>; and mentions a trip
         into unoccupied Japan and thoughts on the Japanese people and
         their attempts to re-build. There is a brief letter, November
         24, 1955, from Hugh and Marian Scott, written on a
         "Thanksgiving Day Menu/Military Sea Transportation
         Service/Pacific Area," mentioning their crossing the
         International Date Line and staying in Japan, Bangkok,
         Hongkong, and Hawaii. A January 19, 1961 letter encloses a
         copy of a letter from Admiral Clifton and an article
         concerning a downed U. S. Navy transport plane in Shikoku,
         Japan. In a November 26, 1964 letter, Scott writes from
         Honolulu, Hawaii, relating his and Marian's travel plans for
         New Zealand and Fiji and mentioning a dinner with
         governor-elect of Washington state, Dan Evans, and his wife.
         Letters of February 3, May 31, and August 10, 1967 mention
         various subjects: meeting Priscilla Holcombe Hall, wife of the
         Consul General at Jerusalem, at the American Club in Tokyo;
         the offer of a Fellowship at Balliol [College at Oxford
         University, England]; plans to attend a dance at the Nelson
         Rockefellers on June 9th; and, writing books. There is a
         letter, n.d. [early 1970s?] from Alice Mitchell Scott Hill on
         letterhead "Crosley Broadcasting of Atlanta, Inc.," discussing
         some of her activities in children's television and mentioning
         her husband T. Gardner Hill and son Richard being loved by the
         family. A letter of December 8, 1975 from Scott to his brother
         and wife, Norman and Beth, encloses the congressional record
         and a statement concerning Scott's retirement at the end of
         the term. A letter, "Tuesday," from Alice Mitchell Scott Hill,
         discusses politics and the 'Hugh Scott Republicans.'</p>
      <p>There are photographs of Hugh Scott at various stages of
         his life, including childhood pictures and with his wife
         Marian. He is also pictured with political figures including
         Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Barry
         Goldwater, and others. There is an autographed photograph of
         Dwight D. Eisenhower and a copy of an autographed photograph
         of Hugh Scott and George Bush, 1993, inscribed "To my
         respected friend Sen. Hugh Scott with lasting pride in you.
         Your friend, George Bush." One of the oversize group
         photographs also includes Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Marian Scott,
         and the Nixon children.</p>
      <p>The political papers, 1939-1990, contain printed materials
         on the legal and political career of Scott, and includes
         newsletters, congressional records, and campaign material.
         Attached to a June 21, 1972 letter are Scott's reports on the
         China trip and a "Statement of Senator Mike Mansfield (D.,
         Montana)/Journey to the New China." There is a typed draft of
         a statement, August 1974, by Scott concerning Watergate and
         the resignation of President Richard Nixon. Two leather bound
         copies of "Tributes to the Honorable Hugh Scott of
         Pennsylvania in the United States Senate/Upon the Occasion of
         his Retirement from the Senate," September 22, 1976, are
         contained.</p>
      <p>The travel notes contain detailed writings and letters on
         naval, political, and personal trips from 1941-1972. There are
         "diary notes" of Scott during incognito service, onboard the
         U. S. S. New Mexico, July- August 1941; these detail chiefly
         social and naval activities en route to and in Iceland and the
         Arctic Circle. There is a printed Navy Day Pictorial, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Octopuss</title>, October 27, 1945.
         Notes on a trip to England and Normandy during service,
         June-July 1944, chronicle daily activities. There are a group
         of letters, October 17, October 21, and November 4, 1945, from
         Scott in Japan to his wife while awaiting orders near the end
         of the second world war; these letters discuss social and
         naval activities, Douglas Southall Freeman being in Tokyo, and
         being ordered to Pearl, Hawaii, and describe in detail a
         harrowing trip to Southern Honshu. There are letters and
         notes, November-December 1959, concerning travel to Australia;
         Bangkok, Thailand; Bombay and Calcutta, India; Tokyo, Japan;
         Hong Kong and Taiwan, Asia; Saigon, Vietnam; Cairo,
         Egypt;Jerusalem, Israel; Kenya, Africa; Salisbury, Rhodesia;
         and, Capetown, South Africa. Letters and writings while on a
         fellowship at Balliol College at Oxford University, England in
         October-November 1967 are quite descriptive and entertaining.
         There are copies of letters, April 1972, concerning the trip
         to China.</p>
