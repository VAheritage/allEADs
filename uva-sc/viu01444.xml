      <p>This item is a manuscript document of a Civil War
         African-American unit, "Muster Roll of Captain [Alfred] W.
         Pinney's, Company H, of the Twenty-Seventh Regiment of U. S.
         Colored Troop Infantry, United State Army, Colonel [Albert] M.
         Blackman, from the day of Enlistment, 1864, when last
         mustered, to the Thirtieth day of June 1864"/Payroll of the
         Company, from the Date of Enrollment, when last paid, to the
         Thirtieth day of June, 1864." Measuring 54 x 79 centimeters,
         it was prepared at Camp Casey, Virginia, June 30, 1864, by
         Captain [Alfred] W. Pinney. Its lists eighty-five officers,
         noncommissioned officers and privates (individually numbered).
         A modified listing of the officers and enlisted men of Company
         H are appended to this guide. (For the muster and payroll of
         Company G of this regiment, see accession number 11402.)</p>
      <p>Company H was formally organized on June 4, 1864; its
         members enlisted between February and May 1864 at Camp
         Delaware and Columbus, Ohio. This document contains ca.
         twenty-seven column headings including names, dates and places
         of enlistment, and pay dates; the "Remarks" column shows the
         soldiers were paid based on their dates of enlistment and some
         received traveling pay. The payroll columns show the privates'
         pay as averaging $13.16 for two months; they either signed
         their names or made their marks ("x") beside them. Payments
         (issued August 21, 1864 and totaling $1,745.52 for the entire
         company), were witnessed by Second Lieutenant James W.
         Shuffleton or First Lieutenant Archibald J. Sampson (later a
         brevet captain, March 13, 1865).</p>
      <p>According to this muster roll Captain Pinney (who died on
         August 8, 1864 of wounds received at Petersburg, Virginia) and
         Lieutenants Sampson and Shuffleton were mustered into military
         service (commissioned) April 1, 1864, Columbus, Ohio, "by
         President Abraham Lincoln." Civilian and military officials
         enrolled several of the privates as substitutes or draftees;
         under columns "Where [enrolled]" and "By Whom [mustered into
         service] these are indicated with ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd,
         11th, etc.) accompanied by the abbreviation "D. O." These
         entries represent congressional districts in Ohio;
         conscription in the Northern states, as administered by the
         provost marshal general's bureau, was organized by
         congressional districts. [Eugene C. Murdock,

         the North</title>(Madison, State Historical Society of
         Wisconsin, 1971), 97-98, 200, 203.]</p>
      <p>The bottom verso notes the results of a report by
         Inspection and Mustering Officer James K. Casey concerning the
         company ("Discipline, Instruction, Military, Appearance, Arms,
         Accoutrements, and Clothing" are rated as being in "Good
         Condition"). Two personal servants (African-Americans)
         employed by officers are identified as William Christian
         (Lieutenant Sampson) and Charly Bray (Lieutenant Shuffleton).
         Also of interest is "A List of Rolls, Returns, and Reports
         From Company Commanders of Volunteer Forces" which identifies
         the types of forms required of military units and when and to
         whom they should be submitted, recapitulations of absent and
         present members, and the number of military tactics manuals
         possessed by the regiment.</p>
      <p>The 27th USCT was organized as a three-year regiment at
         Camp Delaware, Ohio, January 16, 1864, and ordered to
         Annapolis, Maryland. It was attached to the 1st Brigade, 4th
         Division, 9th Corps, Army of the Potomac, to September 1864,
         the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, 9th Corps, and the 1st Brigade,
         1st Division, 25th Corps (the Union army's only all-black
         corps), December 1864. The regiment was attached to the 1st
         Brigade, 3rd Division, 25th Corps, to January 1865, the 3rd
         Brigade, 3rd Division, 25th Corps, to March 1865, the 3rd
         Brigade, 3rd Division, 10th Corps, Department of North
         Carolina, to July 1865, and the Department of North Carolina
         to September 1865.</p>
      <p>The regiment participated in several campaigns in Virginia
         and North Carolina: from the Rapidan to the James River,
         Virginia, May-June 1864; guarding wagon trains of the Army of
         the Potomac during the Wilderness campaign; the Petersburg
         campaign (including the battle of the Crater, July 30, 1864),
         June-December 1864. It fought at Weldon Railroad (August
         1864), Poplar Grove Church (September and October 1864), and
         Bodyton Plank Road, Hatcher's Run (October 1864). It fought at
         Bermuda Hundred (Virginia) front until December 1864; from
         there it participated in the Fort Fisher (North Carolina)
         campaign (December 1864- January 1865), and subsequent actions
         (Sugar Loaf Hill, Federal Point, Fort Anderson, the capture of
         Wilmington, and Northeast Ferry), January-February 1865.</p>
      <p>It participated in the Carolinas campaign (March-April
         1865) including Kinston and Goldsboro and Cox's Bridge (March
         1865) and was among the Union regiments that captured and
         occupied Raleigh, North Carolina (April 1865). Present at the
         surrender of Army of the Tennessee (Confederate) at Bennett's
         House, North Carolina, on April 26, 1865, the regiment
         remained on duty in the Department of North Carolina until
         mustered out on September 21, 1865. For select published
         sources on this regiment, see U. S. Adjutant-General's Office,
