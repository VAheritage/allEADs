      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This addition to the Rives Family Papers contains 55
         letters, 1860-1882, written to William Cabell Rives, Jr., by
         J. D. Osborne, John Coles (1825-1866) and Ann Seddon
         Rutherfoord, John Rutherfoord (1792- 1866), Charles Morris,
         and Francis Robert Rives (1792-1891).</p>
      <p>Rives, Osborne, and Rutherfoord enjoyed a "triangular
         friendly correspondence," exchanging thoughts and observations
         on events of the world, as well as current writtings.</p>
      <p>J. D. Osborne wrote from Paris and nearby cities,
         commenting of Paris churches (1860), living in Paris and Tours
         (December 1863), life during the siege of Paris and Commune
         (August 1871), and the death of Princess de la Moskowa and its
         consequences (February 1881). Osborne also gives his thoughts
         on the Civil War (January and December 1863) and reminisces
         about places in Virginia, including "Castle Hill," the Rivanna
         River, Silver Spring, and Gordonsville (January 1881), and
         past friends, such as Roscoe B. Heath, E. Pendleton Gaines
         (February 1881), and Rives' mother, Judith Pager Walker Rives
         (February 1882).</p>
      <p>John Coles Rutherfoord wrote news of the Rives family and
         Albemarle County during the Civil War, as well as his opinions
         concerning the war and the possible consequences of the Battle
         of Manassas (August 1861). After the war, he wrote about the
         behavior of blacks and the effects of the "new labor system"
         on farming (January 1866). After Rutherfoord's illness and
         subsequent death, his wife Ann continued the
         correspondence.</p>
      <p>Charles Morris wrote seeking educational assistance from
         the Peabody fund for General Reuben Lindsay Walker's son, and
         commented on the efforts to unite blacks and whites, the
         effects of the abolition of slavery, and the upcoming
         constitutional convention (October 1867). He also expressed
         his thoughts on the free blacks and their education, and
         mentioned the successful school established by the Freedom's
         Commssion (December 1867).</p>
      <p>Francis Robert Rives' correspondence is concerned with the
         1882 controversy regarding the Grace Episcopal Church rectory,
         and relates to various aspects thereof, such as the need for a
         copy of the deed and plot, trustees' obligations, funds,
         Virginia laws, individual rights, and the resolutions.</p>
