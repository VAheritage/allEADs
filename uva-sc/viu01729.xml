         in Dallas, Texas, and from September 12, 1917 to December 31,
         1919, and 1920-1923, he was at the College of Industrial Arts
         in Denton, Texas. Topics covered in these letters include
         personal news and news of family and friends, finances,

         Gathering and the Triplett family. Subjects referred to in
         letters of 1917 include: a newsclipping re the arrest of S.

         Mrs. Whitmore's letters sent to Denton, Texas early 1920
         discuss farm transactions and the future sale of the farm and
         often seek advice concerning the farm. A telegram of April 4,
         1923 announces the death of Mrs. Susan Gregory Whitmore
         earlier that afternoon.</p>
      <p>During July and August 1915, Harry Gregory Whitmore was
         traveling to California by way of the Panama Canal and
         returning through the Canadian Rockies. Letters to his mother
         from the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">S. S. Kroonland,</title>Panama Pacific
         Line, give his initial impression of the ship and its
         occupants, including Louisa (Morgan) [Mrs. Herbert Livingston]
         Satterlee, daughter of J. Pierpont Morgan and a Miss Elizabeth
         A. Kittredge. Whitmore includes dates, times, coordinates, and
         names of places approached; he mentions Sandy Hook, Gulf
         Stream, St. Augustine, Key West, San Salvador, Cuba, Haiti,
         Caribbean Sea, Panama Canal, Col&amp;#977696;Gold Hill, Pedro
         Miguel Locks, Miraflores, Panama (City), Balboa, and Costa
         Rica. In his letter of July 24, he gives a description of the
         Gatun Locks. On August 21, he writes about their return route,
         mentioning Edmonton, Alberta, Mt. Robson, Yellowhead Pass,
         British Columbia, and the Grand Trunk Railway. There are also
         several postcards from various places.</p>
      <p>Letters, October 1914 to August 1915, from Samuel L.
         Whitmore to Harry Gregory Whitmore, concern his chiropractic
         career, medical school, and divorce. Initially, Whitmore is
         with Elvin Wheeler, Doctor of Chiropractic, in Atlanta,
         Georgia, while attending lectures at the Georgia College of
         Medicine and Surgery. In October 1914, he relates the effects
         of the cotton crisis on all business, referring to reduced
         work forces and cut wages, resulting in doctors not being paid
         for services. He also mentions taking orders for Aluminum
         Cooking Utensils to supplement wages and Asa G. Candler's
         financial involvement in the medical college. On November 20,
         1914, he discusses the situation with the medical school and
         courses, his financial status, marriage problems and divorce,
         and possible sales representative work with the Reo Automobile
         Company; and comments on hearing Congressman Champ Clark
         (1850-1921). In December 1914, he relates news of his divorce,
         medical situation, financial status, appeal of the sanitarium
         as a place to practice medicine, and the current doctor
         situation, mentioning a few of the prominent doctors and their
         financial situations, stating that "the most that you get out
         of doctoring is reputation." He also mentions the situation
         with the Reo Automobile Company, and the fact that it is the
         largest financial concern in the auto business. In January
         1915, he discusses his sensational divorce, plans for filing
         divorce, and the claims filed in Claire Whitmore's divorce
         petition; a newspaper clipping on the divorce is included. He
         also discusses the situation at the Georgia College of
         Medicine and Surgery following standards being raised by the
         Carnegie Foundation and the American Medical Association. He
         relates that he has been attending medical course lectures,
         and his plans to complete his medical education and then take
         the Florida State Board examinations. In February and March,
         he needs money for tuition and other fees involved in
         dissection, graduation, the state board exam, and registration
         of license. In April, Whitmore refers to the rigid examination
         of the Florida State Board of Medical Examiners, listing
         subject examinations, giving progress on his examinations. He
         details his medical studies and career plans, mentions a gift
         from the class to president D. H. Griffith and his
         presentation. During May, his case is before the Trustees
         concerning the legalities of bestowing a medical diploma on
         him. He is also considering a sales position at the Reo Motor
         Car Company in order to make some money as doctors are having
         a hard time collecting debts for services. On June 15,
         Whitmore writes that the Trustees 'passed' upon the Seniors
         and that he is having to meet with each one; mentions meetings
         with board members D. F. Johnson and John Green and their
         comments; and writes that the opinion is that they can
         graduate him legally but are not sure if it is the right thing
         to do. He also relates the direction of plans with Reo Motor
         Car Company. A letter of July 14 comments on Harry Gregory
         Whitmore's extensive trip to California and its educational
         value and the picture show, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Marse Covington,</title>set in Essex
         County, Virginia. There is a letter, 1920, to Whitmore from M.
         B. Whitmore concerning his father's farm. There are also
         obituaries for Samuel L. Whitmore from July 1941.</p>
