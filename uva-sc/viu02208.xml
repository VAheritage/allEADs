        <p>This collection was given to the Library by Mrs.

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of two disparate items, 1944 and
         1992. The first is a letter written by Deverton Carpenter, a
         member of General George S. Patton's staff in France, and is
         addressed to Howard Dutcher, a former colleague of Carpenter's
         on the Richmond 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">News Leader</title>. It was given to
         Mrs. Norfleet, also a journalist on the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">News Leader</title>during the 1930s, as
         a momento of her colleagues by Howard Dutcher's widow. The
         letter is dated September 5, l944, but Carpenter was killed in
         France before the end of the war.</p>
      <p>Carpenter presents an articulate view of the post-Normandy
         campaign in France, what he calls "a fast-moving shooting
         war." The war action appears disorganized and haphazard:
         Carpenter says the first two weeks in France were like
         "hanging onto the tail of the skyrocket." Solitary enemy tanks
         appear behind Allied lines; drunken Germans beg to be
         captured; and lone snipers create risks in towns presumed to
         have been liberated.</p>
      <p>The letter is valuable for its essentially "civilian"
         description of war. He offers vignettes of liberated French
         towns, breakfasts being interrupted by Luftwaffe strafing
         runs, and champagne being served as a beverage in the
         officer's mess. He comments on the elegance of the French
         women (even those in tattered clothing), and the captured
         German soldiers' fears of being murdered by Frenchmen seeking
         revenge. His letter expresses admiration and respect for
         General Patton, and his pleasure "in having done a bit towards
         winning the war."</p>
      <p>The second item is a twenty-eight page memoir of Amanda
         Stewart Bryan Kane written by Elizabeth Norfleet in 1992. The
         memoir begins by rehearsing the family background of Mrs.
         Kane, who grew up in early twentieth-century Richmond as the
         daughter of the wealthy and respected Stewart and Bryan
         families. The Bryans in particular represented the New South,
         having converted their wealth to transportation and
         communication opportunities after the Civil War. Mrs. Kane
         attended private schools in Richmond and then enrolled at
         Smith College, choosing a northern school in order to broaden
         her horizons. She received a B.A. in English from Smith in
         1927 and returned home to Richmond. In 1929 she married Keith
         Kane, a New York City attorney and businessman, and
         established a home in New York City where they lived for over
         forty years.</p>
      <p>In New York Mrs. Kane engaged in volunteer and charity work
         while raising their four daughters. The Kanes moved in
         distinguished social circles of the business, academic, and
         political worlds of New York from the 1930s to the 1960s. Both
         were deeply committed to various religious, academic, and
         philanthropic works. Both were also involved in the direction
         of their respective alma maters, with Mrs. Kane serving as
         alumnae President, alumnae Trustee, and finally as Chairman of
         the Board of Trustees for Smith. During the 1950s she
         singlehandedly engineered the donation and construction of a
         chapel for Smith, for which effort she was invested with a
         Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1955 when the chapel was
         dedicated.</p>
      <p>After her husband's retirement, the couple moved to
         Charlottesville to be near two of their daughters and their
         families. Soon they found themselves not only continuing their
         earlier associations but pursuing new ones. Mrs. Kane, in
         particular, had moved from an early posture as a "traditional
         conservative" to an "independent liberal" position. She worked
         quietly for decades to promote racial harmony and intellectual
         tolerance. After her husband's death in 1974, Mrs. Kane
         continued to live an active life based in, but not limited to,
         Charlottesville. Increasing blindness imposed limits on her
         mobility as she approached her eighties, and, the church took
         on even more importance in her life. Surrounded by family and
         friends, Mrs. Kane died in 1990. Her legacy to the world was,
         as the author claims, her "intelligent kindness" and a model
         of service to the greater community.</p>
      <p>The memoir is an interesting commentary on a life of
         privilege and service, as well as an addition to Richmond
         local history.</p>
