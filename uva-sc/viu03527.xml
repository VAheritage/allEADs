      <p>This collection of Ambler and Barbour family materials
         includes accession numbers 1921, -a, -b, 1964, 1997, and 1998.
         There are two other collections of related material (#38-77
         and #1140) which will be of interest to anyone researching the
         Ambler family. The first member of the Ambler family to arrive
         in Virginia was Richard Ambler from York, England in 1716. He
         married Elizabeth Jacquelin (daughter of Edward and Martha
         Cary Jacquelin) in 1729. Richard's son Edward gained title to
         the family house in Jamestown and married Mary Cary. Edward
         died in 1768, and Mary Cary Ambler moved her family and
         possessions to Hanover County. Colonel John Ambler (1762-1836)
         was the son of Edward and Mary Cary Ambler. He married three
         times, and his third wife was Catherine Bush Norton. They had
         eight children, the first of whom was John Jacquelin Ambler
         (1801-1854). John Jacquelin Ambler married Elizabeth Barbour,
         and they had three children, the eldest of whom was John
         Jacquelin Ambler, Jr. (1828--1901).</p>
      <p>The Ambler family material in the collection is comprised
         chiefly of the personal and business papers of John, John
         Jacquelin, and John Jacquelin Ambler, Jr. They owned the
         estates of Glenambler and Jacquelin Hall in Amherst and Orange
         Counties. Early correspondence includes letters to Edward,
         Richard, and Mary Ambler. A 1748 April 28 letter from Martha
         Jacquelin to Edward Ambler mentions moving to Jamestown
         because of smallpox. Business letters to Edward Ambler include
         those from Thomas Ludwell Lee, John Shaw, Robert C. Nicholas,
         William Dabney, George Shaw, and Samuel Athawes.</p>
      <p>A few letters from Richard Ambler (1748-1752) to his sons
         Edward and John (1734-1766) provide fatherly advice on the
         proper education for them and on making the most of their time
         at Wakefield Academy in England. Letters during the 1820's to
         Colonel John Ambler pertain mostly to agriculture. Dabney T.
         Phillips writes to Colonel Ambler (1824 December 5) with
         advice on whipping slaves for their discipline and clearing
         land for tobacco crops.</p>
      <p>Letters to John Jacquelin Ambler include a few from his
         parents while he was in England for his education in the early
         1820's. Catherine Ambler wrote from Richmond to her son (1823
         Oct 27) mentioning Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Gilmer. An 1825
         February 5 letter from James Ambrose mentions the presidential
         election; Ambrose predicts Jackson will win. In an 1842
         January 26 letter, Richard Cary Ambler announces the death of
         their brother Norbonne and his lack of a will. Another letter
         from John Jacquelin, Jr. to his father tells of his attendance
         at a temperance lecture and joining a "tetotal" society (1842
         February 7).</p>
      <p>Political matters are discussed in an 1842 Feb 24 letter
         from B.M. Yancey (secretary of the Tippecanoe Club) in which
         he mentions the purchase of a flag for the Richmond [Whig]
         Convention one year ago. There are also letters about
         extending the Louisa Railroad beyond Gordonsville (3 June 1847
         and 12 September 1847). Agricultural discussions abound in
         these letters, and in an 1854 August 23 letter from John
         Jacquelin, Jr. to his father, he asks whether he should sell
         their wheat at the current market price ($1.55 per bushel) or
         store part of it.</p>
      <p>Letters to John Jacquelin Ambler, Jr. include several
         letters with parental advice while he was attending the
         University of Virginia. An 1848 March 20 letter mentions the
         loss of a servant girl to consumption. John Jacquelin
         congratulates his son on being at the University of Virginia
         rather than William &amp; Mary (27 October 1848). The railroad
         question surfaces again in a letter dated 1852 December
         11.</p>
      <p>Barbour family material includes letters to E.P. Barbour,
         Frances F. Barbour, and Philip P. Barbour. Most of these are
         family letters, except for a number of letters to Philip P.
         Barbour regarding legal cases he was involved in as a lawyer
         and several on political matters. There is an 1830 [Sep ?] 28
         letter signed by Martin Van Buren offering Philip Barbour the
         position of District Judge of Virginia. William R. Robinson
         writes to Barbour about the Virginia General Assembly
         election, his brother's candidacy, and party politics in an
         1830 May 9 letter. An 1835 October 4 letter to Philip Barbour
         requests that he be the "umpire" in a contested election in
         Albemarle County. Thomas W. Gilmer wrote to Barbour about
         running for the Vice Presidency on the Jackson ticket on 4
         November 1831. Also of interest is a notice dated 1832
         November 14 sent to Philip Barbour about a runaway slave named
         Moses.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous correspondence includes a memorandum dated
         August 1821 ("Amherst Memorandum") regarding the hiring of an
         overseer. The writer gives very specific instructions about
         the most desirable candidate and how the estate should be run.
         Also included in this file is a 16 September [18]33 letter of
         advice from Philip P. Barbour to "My young friend". Other
         correspondents include James Maury (1823 Aug 18); Edmund
         Randolph to Robert Carter Nicholas concerning the
         Revolutionary War (1777 Jul 24); Governor James Barbour to
         John J. Ambler (1838 Jun 15 &amp; Nov 26) About one-third of
         this folder is business correspondence, and about two-thirds
         is family correspondence.</p>
      <p>Several letters, one from James Monroe to John
         Brockenbrough (1823 Jun 25, Monroe Papers) regarding John
         Ambler, Henry Clay to Philip N. Nicholas (1823 Feb 26, Clay
         Papers), Martin Van Buren to Philip P. Barbour (1830 [Sep?]
         28, Autograph File) and another from Washington Irving (1823
         Nov 5, Autograph File) have been copied and the originals
         placed in the vault.</p>
      <p>Legal materials in this collection include the 
          wills of: 
         <lb/><lb/>Matthew Miller July 10, 1753 
         <lb/>John Hopkins (copy) August 1765 
         <lb/>David Rodes February 1794 
         <lb/>Michael Carpenter (copy)(oversize) November 26, 1805 
         <lb/>Thomas Payne March 15, 1809 
         <lb/>William C. Wibby March 2, 1814 
         <lb/>Philip P. Barbour December 20, 1840</p>
      <p>All of these wills (foldered separately from the other
         legal material) mention slaves and arrange for their
         disposition to the various heirs. The folder of 
          legal papers contains land grants
         for King William County, a law suit in Orange County, oaths of
         office for the judgeship of the district court of the United
         States, and a record of the sale of a mulatto boy to Philip
         Barbour (20 January 1841). There are also petitions to Philip
         Barbour from the freeholders of Madison and Louisa Counties.
         Also notable is a legal action against Benjamin Cottrill by
         Benjamin Moseley for the loss of a slave boy named Will. The
         slave died while trying to take Cottrill's horses across the
         Slate River in Tillotson Parish, Rockingham County.</p>
      <p>The 
          financial papers include a detailed
         two page doctor's bill from Dr. Samuel McAffee to Mr. Francis
         Hague, memoranda concerning crops and lists of property for
         Colonel Ambler's upper plantation, including slaves and their
         ages. Most of the financial papers are from the Barbour
         family, including accounts and tobacco sales. There is an
         undated list of "People upon the Lower Places in Amherst"
         which is broken down by sex for Westham, Lakeland, Mill Farm,
         and Cottage. There is also an undated list of "Negroes at
         Colonel Ambler's quarters in Amherst," divided into upper and
         lower quarters, listing their occupations. Single women and
         children are also included in this list.</p>
      <p>The small 
          bound volumes in this collection
         include a coverless notebook (1821) with notes for "Cottage",
         "Mill Farm", and "Lakeland". It lists clothing of slaves,
         livestock, tools, and tobacco crops. In the back of this
         volume there are pencil sketches of figures and partially
         obscured notes in pencil. An 1831 coverless volume contains
         the travel notes of John Jacquelin Ambler on a trip to
         Richmond and Baltimore. He describes in some detail an illness
         he is seeking treatment for, and the treatments he has tried.
         There is also present a pocket calendar (1848) with a few
         notes.</p>
      <p>The hand-written 
          addresses by Philip P. Barbour
         include one entitled "To the Congressional District composed
         of . . . Spotsylvania, Louisa, Orange, and Madison," and the
         other is "An Answer to Gilmer". The 
          oversize material (see OS P-4 and
         temporary location Processing Hall Shelf 30) includes a
         broadside, the "Catalogue of the Law Library of the Late Judge
         Barbour" dated August 2, 1841. Also notable is a broadside
         notice for the sale of "15 Likely Servants" December 8, 1841
         by Frances Todd Barbour. There is a document appointing Philip
         Barbour associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, signed by
         Andrew Jackson.</p>
      <p>There are 
          genealogical notes , probably by
         Beverly Gish at the end of the collection, and an incomplete
         genealogical chart for the Ambler family in the oversize
         material.</p>
