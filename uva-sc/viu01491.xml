      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of two bound photograph albums
         containing 96 sepia-tone albumen prints (19 x 24 cm), ca.
         1890, of scenes in Wise County, Virginia, primarily in the
         immediate vicinity of Big Stone Gap and Stonega. (The dating
         was partly established by the absence of automobiles or other
         motor vehicles.) The photographs may have been taken by a
         photographer or construction engineer for the Southern
         Railroad (then called the South Atlantic &amp; Ohio), which
         was completed through Big Stone Gap in 1890. Many of the
         scenes are of railroads, yards and maintenance facilities,
         bridges and tunnels, as well as cuts and related geological
         features. More likely, given the fact that the captions were
         typed and the photographs professionally mounted and bound,
         and include the natural beauty, people and industries of the
         region in general, they may have been prepared as a
         "promotional video" to attract business and industry. Aside
         from the captions, which are given verbatim below, there is no
         identification of the subject matter or the photographer.</p>
      <p>Included are a number of photographs of people, both
         individuals and groups, and including African-Americans. Given
         the premise above, the people depicted include both officials,
         workers, and their families, as well as various local business
         or social groups and organizations. A number of the
         photographs of people were taken in front of their homes,
         which affords the opportunity to also study the local
         architecture and the condition of the housing, as well as
         personal details such as dress.</p>

      <head>Adjunct Descriptive Data</head>
      <p>Copy negatives have been made of all of the photographs in
         the albums, and are filed in negative collection Pnts-162.
         Photographic copies may be made from the negatives by citing
         the negative collection and the item number, ie: "Pnts-162
         item 7."
