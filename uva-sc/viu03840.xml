emigrate, noting that William Morrison and his family, plus others, will move to Tennessee. A number of illnesses and deaths are mentioned, plus a few marriages.

            <unittitle>Burwell notes the emigration from Virginia, and reiterates his desire and that of his brother, John, to relocate to the South. (According to what Thomas' brother, Walter, had told him earlier in the
day, even his father is moving to Tennessee). The letter includes news that William Morrison has purchased land in Tennessee, as well as family and business news. The commentary on government and politics reveals
that Burwell favors Andrew Jackson.

            <unittitle>Burwell reports that he, his brother John, and Mr. Deathuage plan to leave Virginia "next fall." He includes the news that Thomas' father and family has "set out for the western district in Tennessee"
in company with William Berkly and his family. In frankly discussing his desire to move to a healthier economic climate, Burwell states, "There is no country that I would prefer to Virginia for health and society,
but the current of the times seems to be against her...." He also laments that he remains a bachelor.

continued emigration, and notes that the "property at Gaines Crossroads has been sold by Ficklin &amp; Warren to William Fletcher..." He and Mr. Deathuage wish to purchase the property, but understand the title is
clouded by the case of "John Morrison's Creditors vs. The United States" (now in the Supreme Court). Burwell comments on politics and the amendment of the [Virginia] constitution.
