         <geogname>Essex County, Virginia</geogname>. Included are

         graduation from schools at the

      <p>Although little seems to be known or published about the
         Latane family, valuable information may be found in

      <p>The early eighteenth century correspondence contains many
         letters from 
         <persname>Henry Latane</persname>and his wife, 
         <persname>Anne Latane</persname>, London, England, to his
         brother, 
         <persname>Lewis Latane</persname>(1672-1732) and his third
         wife, 
         <persname>Mary (Deane) Latane</persname>(1685-1765), South
         Farnham Parish, Essex County. Some of the letters are written
         in French but the majority of them are in English. During the
         1720s, Henry frequently advised Lewis to grow another crop
         besides tobacco, saying that Europe could not consume all that
         comes from America. In a letter of January 13, 1730, Henry is
         "impatient to know what the fate of Europe whether warr or
         Peace everything seems to tend to a Crisis ...," possibly
         referring to the trade conflict between England and Spain.</p>
      <p>After her husband's death in 1732, Mary (Deane) Latane
         managed the property that came to her and her children, with
         the help of her cousin, 
         <persname>William Beverley</persname>(1698-1756). There are
         several letters, 1733-1750, from Beverley discussing the
         settlement of her husband's estate and the sale of her
         tobacco. In addition, there are business correspondence, bills
         of lading, invoices, and other papers concerning the sale of
         tobacco.</p>
      <p>Letters of interest include correspondence of 
         <persname>Spencer Roane</persname>(1762-1822), King and Queen
         County, and 
         <persname>William Latane</persname>(1750-1811), Essex County,
         July 1791-August 1792, concerning the deed and survey for the
         "Mount Clement Trail of Land," and another on July 25, 1804 re
         the suit of Braxton vs Roane; letters on April 19, 1825, June
         13, 1826, and November 18, 1826, from 
         <persname>James Montague</persname>, 
         <geogname>Harden County, Kentucky</geogname>, to friends in
         Essex County, concerning various aspects of life in Kentucky
         such as the conflict between anti-relief and relief parties,
         tobacco sales, and prices of corn, flour, cotton, whiskey, et
         al.; one on June 9, 1854, from Rev. 
         <persname>Henry W. L. Temple</persname>, Wayland, to 
         <persname>James Allen Latane</persname>, University of
         Virginia, discussing Bishop 
         <persname>William Meade</persname>'s visit; and, several
         letters, October 25, 1864, December 4, 1871, February 2 and
         June 15, 1883, and June 13, 1885, from 
         <persname>Thomas S. Watson</persname>, Bracketts, chiefly to 
         <persname>Julia A. Holladay</persname>, 
         <geogname>Botetourt County, Virginia</geogname>, mentioning
         news of family and friends, new dwellings built on Ionia, and
         his being disqualified as a member of the legislature.</p>
      <p>Letters pertaining to black history include one of December
         10, 1772, from 
         <persname>Samuel Peachey, Jr.</persname>, 
         <geogname>Occoquan Furnace</geogname>, to William Latane,
         Essex County, asking him to send a young black at Christmas
         because the latter wants to learn the blacksmith trade; one of
         November 10, 1788, from 
         <persname>Bartlett Williams</persname>, New Kent, to 
         <persname>William Latane</persname>, Essex County, complaining
         about Latane's man Ephraim corrupting his blacks, and
         requesting that he not be permitted to visit his plantation; a
         circular, February 27, 1794, referring to the transportation
         of slaves from Africa to the West-India islands; one of
         February 28, 1809, from S. Chenault, Nelson County, Kentucky,
         re the "elopement" of Franklin and his recovery by a Captain
         Lafon who kept him in his possession for awhile;
         correspondence between 
         <persname>Henry Waring Latane</persname>(1782-1860), Essex
         County, and his brother-in-law, 
         <persname>John Temple</persname>( -1812), Parkersburg, re the
         death of Temple's father and the division of his slaves at
         "Goldberry," December 10, 1811 and January 8, 1812; and, one
         of June 13, 1885, from 
         <persname>Thomas S. Watson</persname>, Bracketts, to 
         <persname>Julia A. Holladay</persname>, Botetourt County,
         mentioning the poisoning of some children by a black
         woman.</p>
      <p>The business papers are comprised of accounts and
         administrative and estate papers as well as general
         correspondence and papers. The accounts are chiefly for
         members of the Latane and Waring families, and, to a lesser
         extent, for members of the 
         <famname>Allen family</famname>and 
         <famname>Temple family</famname>. The administrative and
         estate papers concern the estates of 
         <persname>William Peachey</persname>( -1700), 
         <persname>Lewis Latane</persname>(1672-1732), 
         <persname>Robert Payne Waring</persname>(-1799?), 
         <persname>William Latane</persname>(1750-1811), 
         <persname>John Temple</persname>( -1812), 
         <persname>Lewis Dix</persname>( -1815?), 
         <persname>James Allen</persname>( -1820?), 
         <persname>Ann Latane</persname>( -1820?), and 
         <persname>Henry Waring Latane</persname>(1782-1860). Also,
         there are business papers pertaining to black history; and, a
         separate itemized listing has been compiled.</p>
      <p>The legal papers contain many indentures, land grants and
         plats/surveys for lands in 
         <geogname>Essex County</geogname>, 
         <geogname>King and Queen County</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Rappahannock County</geogname>. These papers are
         helpful in determining ownership of lands held by the Latane
         Family, 
         <famname>Roane Family</famname>, 
         <famname>Allen Family</famname>, and 
         <famname>Dix Family</famname>. In addition, there are copies
         of wills for members of the Latane, Roane, Allen, and Dix
         families. The wills also contain references to the division of
         blacks among the families.</p>
      <p>There are also genealogical, military, and religious
         material. The military papers, 1814-1828, pertain chiefly to
         James Allen's career as captain in the Virginia militia and
         include abstracts of forage, regimental orders, receipt for
         arms, detailed returns of arms accoutrements, and rosters of
         officers and other personnel. Among the miscellaneous papers
         is a small group of material concerning religious matters,
         particularly having to do with 
         <corpname>South Farnham Parish</corpname>in Essex County.
         Included are a letter, December 17, 1716, from 
         <persname>Alexander Spotswood</persname>to the vestry of the
         parish re their decision to suspend 
         <persname>Lewis Latane</persname>from his ministerial office;
         a hymn book belonging to 
         <persname>John Latane</persname>; and, two letters about the
         weakening of the Church in Virginia.</p>
