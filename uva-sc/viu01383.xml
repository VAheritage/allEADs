        <p>These Virginiana items were given to the Library by Paul
            Collinge, Heartwood Books, Charlottesville, Virginia, on
            September 27, 1993.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The earliest item is the brown bound memoranda book
         belonging a King William County, Virginia, lawyer, 1871-1872,
         mentioning several circuit court cases.</p>
      <p>There are two letters to Victor Sharp Metcalf (1896-1918),
         one from R. Warner Wood, director of The Blue Ridge Camp For
         Boys, June 6, 1916, thanking Metcalf for the program of the
         Richmond College Commencement and wishing him every success.
         The other letter is from W.L. Prince, dean of Richmond
         Academy, June 21, 1916, inviting Metcalf to stay with him in
         Richmond until his family returns from Blue Ridge. Victor
         Sharp Metcalf, an University of Virginia alumnus and United
         States Naval Reserve Officer, was born at Georgetown,
         Kentucky, but moved to Richmond, Virginia, in 1904. During the
         summers of 1912-1914, Metcalf was a member of the Blue Ridge
         Boys Camp in Albemarle County; he received his Bachelor of
         Arts degree from Richmond College in June 1916. For the next
         two years he attended the University of Virginia, receiving
         the Master of Arts degree in June 1918. He enlisted in the
         United States Naval Reserve after graduation but died of
         illness while in training at Hampton Roads. Present in the
         collection is the privately printed "Tribute of Love" honoring
         the memory of Metcalf.</p>
      <p>Arthur Wallace Peach (1886-?), author of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Vermont Prose: A Miscellany</title>and
         a member of the Author's League of America, Inc. and The
         Poetry Society of America, Inc., writes a one page letter,
         March 27, 1920, Northfield, Vermont, to Miss Mary Evelyn
         Stiles, Richmond, Virginia, sending her an autographed copy of
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Hill Trails</title>and regretting
         that he could not locate the leaflets of the poem, "A Full
         Life." A two page letter from Peach, April 24, 1922, to "My
         dear Virginia Friend" [Miss Mary Evelyn Stiles?], explains the
         confusion resulting from a mischievous report by a friend that
         Peach had prepared his poems for book publication, refers to
         the opening of a children's library in memory of Father John
         Banister Tabb, and lists his fee for poetry readings and
         informal lectures at twenty-five dollars plus expenses.</p>
      <p>Also present is a Register of Service, for the American Red
         Cross, Richmond, Virginia Chapter, Canteen Committee, for
         May-July 1919.</p>
