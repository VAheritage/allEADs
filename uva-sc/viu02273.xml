        <p>This collection was donated to the University of
            Virginia Library on December 31, 1962 by Mr. Clifton Waller
            Barrett of Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>

        <head>Provenance</head>
        <p>Mr. Barrett had purchased the manuscript from a dealer.
            The following passage detailing the earlier provenance of
            the manuscript is copied from the dealer's sale
            catalogue:</p>
        <p>"Irving was in England when he conceived and wrote 
            <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Sketch Book</title>and he
            intrusted his old friend, Henry Brevoort, with its
            publication in America. Their correspondence, now in the
            Yale University Library, gives a detailed ... account of
            its publishing history. It is unquestionably due to
            Brevoort, also, that this precious manuscript has been
            preserved. Apparently only the manuscript of these first
            three parts was sent to him, hence it was all he could
            save. Irving wrote to him on Aug. 2, 1819: 'I forward
            Sketck Book No. 4 to my brother E. Irving.' This has been
            lost. Later Irving wrote Brevoort: 'I shall send no more
            manuscript to America until I put it to press here,' so it
            seems most likely that the final three American parts were
            set up from English sheets and that the manuscript was not
            preserved by the English publisher, Murray, or by Irving,
            if Murray returned it to him ...</p>
        <p>"[This manuscript of the first three parts] has been
            privately owned [ex libris Bois Penrose II] since its
            publication, [and] was recently purchased by private treaty
            by Scribners ... [It] is now offered for the first time for
            public sale."</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The manuscript of Washington Irving's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon,
         Gent.</title>in the Clifton Waller Barrett Library, consists
         of 213 leaves, 4to, of the first three parts of the seven-part
         work, mounted in bound volume (28 1/2 cm.), with an engraving
         of Washington Irving by G. Parker in front, plus the
         twelve-leaf manuscript of "The Broken Hear" and the first two
         leaves of the published version of "A Royal Poet." (The
         version of "A Royal Poet" contained in the volume is at
         variance with the published text). With the exception of "The
         Wife," some introductory notes published with the stories, and
         the remaining portion of the published version of "A Royal
         Poet," the manuscript appears complete. The manuscript
         contains extra title-page and contents leaf, and each story is
         preceded by an extra title-page.</p>

      <p>" 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Sketch Book</title>holds a most
         important place in American literary history. 'The Legend of
         Rip Van Winkle' of course, is immortal and has always been
         recognized as the charming and abiding production of its
         author. 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Sketch Book</title>itself is the
         volume by which Irving is best known today among readers on
         both sides of the Atlantic ...</p>
      <p>"'...In the production of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Sketch Book</title>, Irving was
         able not only to enhance his fame by a charming contribution
         to literature, but to render a special service to two
         countries - England and America. The book came into print at a
         time when the bitterness of the war, which closed in 1814, was
         still fresh in the minds of both contestants. It was a time
         when it was the fashion in America to use Great Britain as a
         bugaboo - as a synonym for all that was abominated in
         political theories, and in political action. The word
         'British' was associated in the minds of most Americans with
         an attempt at domination, while in England, on the other hand,
         references to the little Yankee nation were no more friendly,
         and things American were persistently decried and sneered at.
         ... It was given to Irving to make clear to his countrymen
         that Americans were competent not merely to organize a state
         but to produce a literature...and it was in part (this book)
         which showed such sympathetic appreciation of things and of
         men English, that England was brought to a better
         understanding of America... If Irving's descriptions of rural
         England were to give fresh interest to American readers in the
         old home of their forefathers, the skill with which he
         utilized the traditional legends of the Catskill Mountains
         made it clear to readers on the other side of the Atlantic
         that imagination and literary style were not restricted to
         Europe.' [

         Literature</title>, Vol. I, p. 255-257.]</p>
      <p>"Sidney Smith's famous sneer in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Edinburgh Review</title>: 'In the
         fourt quarters of the globe, who reads an American book?' was
