      <p>Robert C. J. Cary was born in Georgetown in 1800, son of
         William Cary of Frederick, Maryland. After spending time in
         Georgia with his cousin, Congressman George Cary, he graduated
         from the Jefferson College of Medicine in Philadelphia,
         Pennsylvania. He married Frances Crow Mathews, daughter of
         John Mathews, clerk of Greenbrier County, Virginia (now West
         Virginia). They went to live in Fort Ball, Seneca County,
         Ohio, with his aunt, Eleanor Cary (Mrs. Henry) Brish. In Ohio,
         Robert Cary built the first brick house used as a medical
         office. His sister, Eliza Cary, married Frederick Green and
         also moved to Ohio. For more information on this Cary family

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This is a letter, June 1, 1829, from Robert C. J. Cary,
         Graceham, Frederick County, Maryland, to his sister, Eliza
         (Cary) Green, Lewisburg, Greenbrier County, Virginia (now West
         Virginia). The letter concerns her detention at Staunton,
         Virginia, the journey from Staunton to Lewisburg, their plans
         to move west to Ohio, and his current problems with creditors.
         Cary describes in detail his perception of the scenery -- "the
         succession of mountain, dale and valley" -- on the journey
         between Staunton and Lewisburg, commenting that "at this
         season of the year no country possesses more grandeur, beauty,
         variety &amp; magnificence of scenery." He writes that
         following her departure a report became prevalent that she did
         not mean to return and that he intended to give them the slip
         to Ohio on the first of June, explaining the reason his
         creditors are pushing to settle his accounts. Other persons or
         topics mentioned are: Mrs. Chambers of Staunton, Virginia; Mr.
         and Mrs. Erskine, her traveling companions; having the
         carriage repaired; the false rumor concerning the death of
         Eleanor Cary Brish; and, Cyrus Cary.</p>
