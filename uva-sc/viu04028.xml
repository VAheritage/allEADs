He mentions his dislike for teaching and his decision to pass on a military career because of all the standing and waiting that is required in peacetime.

He describes his men as looking forward to it with great intensity while he dreads it because they can "drink a case of whiskey per man" and he has to get them all back in one piece. He also mentions that [Evan] joins the Raven Society at the University of Virginia.

He writes that the Fifth and Seventh Marines have been "shot up" at the "Berlin,"  "East Berlin," "Vegas," and "Carson" outposts. He is glad that he signed up for the First Marines because they are safely in the rear, miles from the shooting. He believes that the news about a truce is getting better every day and that the Chinese are trying to save face by causing an increase in the fighting.
