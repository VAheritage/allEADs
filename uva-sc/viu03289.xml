      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Reaumur Coleman Stearnes was born on April 8, 1866 in
         Dublin, Pulaski County, Virginia, the son of Dr. John Lewis
         and Phoebe Ann (nee McDermed) Stearnes. He won Greek and
         philosophy medals from the University of Richmond and was
         graduated in 1887 as valedictorian of his class. He married
         Mary Elizabeth Arnold in 1888. During the period 1888-1906, he
         taught mathematics and science at Allegheny Institute,
         Roanoke; was division superintendent of public schools for
         Roanoke County; practiced law at Salem; and helped organize
         the Cooperative Education Association and the Virginia State
         Teachers' Association, of which he served as president from
         1901 to 1906.</p>
      <p>Stearnes was appointed secretary to the State Board of
         Education in 1906. In 1913, upon the resignation of Dr. Joseph
         E. Eggleston, he was appointed Superintendent of Public
         Instruction. He was elected to the position in 1914 and served
         until 1918 when he lost a re-election bid. During World War I
         he served in various capacities for the War Camp Community
         Service in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1922 to 1925 he attended
         Columbia University, receiving an MA degree. He taught
         mathematics at New York University and Stony Brook School from
         1925 to 1939. He also lectured on business administration and
         secretarial studies at Merchants and Bankers' Business and
         Secretarial School, New York. In 1936, at age 70, Stearnes
         earned a Ph.D. degree from New York University.</p>
      <p>Stearnes was a member of the Sons of the American
         Revolution, Phi Delta Kappa, Phi Delta Theta, Pi Mu Epsilon,
         and was a thirty-third degree Mason and Grand Secretary of the
         Royal Arcanum Lodge. Reaumur C. Stearnes died in New York City
         on May 25, 1946, and was buried in Dublin, Pulaski County,
         Virginia.</p>
      <p>A doctoral dissertation entitled "The Life and
         Administration of Reaumur Coleman Stearnes" by Vearl G.
         McBride is available in the University of Virginia
         Library.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Reaumur Coleman Stearnes Papers consist chiefly of
         correspondence, bound volumes, financial and legal papers,
         reports, newspaper clippings, printed materials, photographs
         and memorabilia. The papers pertain to Stearnes' life and his
         career in public education and especially relate to his
         service as secretary of the Virginia State Board of Education,
         1906-1913, as Superintendent of Public Instruction, 1913-
         1918, and in various capacities for the War Camp Community
         Service, 1918-1922. Topics of interest in the correspondence
         pertaining to education include: textbook adoption,
         certification of teachers, courses of study, and his bid for
         re-election as Superintendent of Public Instructions. Other
         topics for which there is material include citizen efforts to
         run recreational activities in Georgia during World War I,
         local political campaigns, and family and personal matters,
         particularly his teaching, and futher education at New York
         University.</p>
      <p>As secretary to the State Board of Education and
         Superintendent of Public Instruction, Stearnes reviewed the
         credentials of physicians who intended to practice in Virginia
         to be certain they met a requirement of four years of high
         school. The political, social, religious and racial
         implications of his decisions are documented in the
         correspondence and related papers pertaining to the topic.
         Considerable information on the candidates for certification
         is also present.</p>
      <p>Financial and legal papers chiefly pertain to Stearnes'
         business transactions, his career as a lawyer, and to the
         Stearnes family itself.</p>
      <p>Prominent correspondents include: Edwin Anderson Alderman,
         Paul B. Barringer, R. F. Boatwright, William Cabell Bruce,

         filed together in a single folder directly after the last of
         the bound volumes. Item-by-item listings of the bound volumes,
         oversize and other disparate materials in Series IX are
