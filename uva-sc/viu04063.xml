                            popularity as a patient, like his popularity in other lives, is extreme.

                            detective stories, I am in a most justly exalted position, and I cannot

                                feels that everyone should read poetry. Tarkington believes that he
                                knows the reason for this odd thought, "The sight of your house at
                                Chestnut Hill, or of the one at Kennebunkport would convince anyone

                                have Massey as a character and the fourth "Cider of Normandy" has an

                                with its meaning conveyed by "calamity in the drama."

                                to Booth Tarkington, thanks him for his letter, appreciates that the
                                coast is well protected and thinks that hunting for subs with depth
                                bombs would be a more interesting and exciting sport than hunting
                                whales; he also gives his assessment of the state of the war,
                                expecting Hitler to revamp and dash off to Africa through Spain and
                                Portugal, and through Turkey to the Dardanelles to grab the
                                Mediterranean; discusses the debate about whether it will be more
                                effective to tackle the Pacific or Europe first; worries if the Axis
                                powers are able to take control of the Philippines, Singapore and
                                the Dutch East Indies, since that could prolong the war by at least
                                five years, concluding: "All that we can do is to hope, keep our
                                chins up and trust that a reorganization of those in charge of our
                                production in Washington will bring about a situation where maximum
                                results may be obtained. I consider it quite an accomplishment for
                                Mr. Big [F.D. Roosevelt?] to do as he should have done a year or a
                                year and a half ago, appoint one competent individual at the head of
                                our defense program, which I think is the most encouraging step that
                                has been taken, but whether or not he will keep hands off is still
                                somewhat problematical, and if we could get Mrs. Big to retire
                                gracefully from her continuous and irritating activities, we would
                                be still better off." </unittitle>

                                sure. After all, the true test of any novel is: does the reader
                                dwell in the environment of his page characters as well as feel with
                                them. And somehow, albeit I know mine own fleeting impressions of
                                the spot you love, I now have an impression that I've lived there
                                for moons. The odors, the vistas, the sounds of the rocky
                                coast… they filled a Ghetto living room last night. And can
                                any writer demand more than realization that he wiped off the map
                                for a couple of hours such a horrendous terrain?" </unittitle>

                                of us humans to keep on an even keel. For he has never preached
                                tolerance and understanding - he has radiated it, in, between, and
                                behind his lines. There lies a Sahara desert between preaching and
