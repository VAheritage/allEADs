                            popularity as a patient, like his popularity in other lives, is extreme.
                            As Mr. Tarkington's amanuensis, and part-time hospital reader-aloud of
                            detective stories, I am in a most justly exalted position, and I cannot
                            avoid suspecting that I was asked to write this article in order that

                                have Massey as a character and the fourth "Cider of Normandy" has an

                                there is almost no chance of being able to do a book with Mr. Wyeth
                                within the next two years. Tarkington then suggests they try "one of

                                his English visitors, who soon sail for home. He describes the
                                activities of one of them, "Mr. Warner, 78, dances wildly every
                                evening with Betty - tangos, Russian jigs, minuets and maudlin-like
                                interpretative dancing." Tarkington also encloses the October issue

                                sending a copy to Mr. Vose in Boston since "they're calling him 'Mr.
                                Rumblin' in Boston and elsewhere, and your brother circulated the
                                rumor that I was Vose Galleries 'ideal client.' He also mentions

                                Ludendorff had thrust through to Amiens, when all the military

                                to Booth Tarkington, thanks him for his letter, appreciates that the
                                coast is well protected and thinks that hunting for subs with depth
                                bombs would be a more interesting and exciting sport than hunting
                                whales; he also gives his assessment of the state of the war,
                                expecting Hitler to revamp and dash off to Africa through Spain and
                                Portugal, and through Turkey to the Dardanelles to grab the
                                Mediterranean; discusses the debate about whether it will be more
                                effective to tackle the Pacific or Europe first; worries if the Axis
                                powers are able to take control of the Philippines, Singapore and
                                the Dutch East Indies, since that could prolong the war by at least
                                five years, concluding: "All that we can do is to hope, keep our
                                chins up and trust that a reorganization of those in charge of our
                                production in Washington will bring about a situation where maximum
                                results may be obtained. I consider it quite an accomplishment for
                                Mr. Big [F.D. Roosevelt?] to do as he should have done a year or a
                                year and a half ago, appoint one competent individual at the head of
                                our defense program, which I think is the most encouraging step that
                                has been taken, but whether or not he will keep hands off is still
                                somewhat problematical, and if we could get Mrs. Big to retire
                                gracefully from her continuous and irritating activities, we would
                                be still better off." </unittitle>
