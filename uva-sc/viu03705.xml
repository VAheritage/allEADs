      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Alice Carlotta Jackson was born on June 2, 1913, above her
         father's pharmacy, in Richmond, Virginia, to James Edward
         Jackson, Sr. (1879-1957) and Clara Louise Kersey Jackson
         (1886-1960). During her elementary and high school years, she
         attended the Hartshorn Memorial College (1919-1930), which
         operated from 1883 until 1930, when the elementary and high
         school programs were eliminated and the college department
         merged with Virginia Union University. It was located on the
         site of present day Maggie L. Walker High School in Richmond,
         Virginia.</p>
      <p>Jackson received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Virginia
         Union University in 1934 and her Master of Arts degree from
         Columbia University in 1939, with her thesis "Literary
         Criticism in John Milton's Prose Works." For a draft of her
         thesis see Box 22 of this collection.</p>
      <p>In addition she attended the following workshops:
         Psychology at Howard University (1948); Speech for Classroom
         Teachers, Virginia Commonwealth University (1951); Fellow Fund
         for Advancement of Education, Ford Foundation (1953-1954),
         where she traveled, studied, and participated in productions
         for Mass Media in Education at Teacher's College, Columbia
         University and the University of Southern California ; Rutgers
         Workshop for High School Teachers of English (1959); Fairleigh
         Dickenson University - Poetry Society of America Creative
         Writing Workshop (1963); and a Casenovia College NEH Workshop
         on Resources for Teaching Literature of Black America (1969).
         She also received a National Endowment for the Humanities
         grant in 1981 for a research project. Files with information
         about most of these post graduate education and enrichment
         opportunities can be found in Series IV: Subject and Topical
         Files.</p>
      <p>Alice Jackson had applied to the University of Virginia
         graduate school in 1935 and was the first known
         African-American to seek admission into a Virginia state
         graduate or professional school. Her application was rejected
         by the University of Virginia because of her race and for
         "other good and sufficient reasons" not spelled out in
         correspondence between the University and Alice Jackson
         (copies of this correspondence and related material can be
         found in Box 54). As a result of her application, the Virginia
         General Assembly established a tuition supplement fund for
         minority students who wanted to attend graduate and
         professional schools out of state. This legislation was worked
         out by the Virginia Commission on Interracial Cooperation to
         provide a tuition supplement that would compensate for the
         difference in cost for attending an out-of-state school.</p>
      <p>The teaching experience of Alice Jackson Stuart included
         work at Virginia Union University (1935-1936); teaching French
         at what is now Norfolk State College (1936-1937);
         Bethune-Cookman College (1938-1942); Howard University
         (1944-1950); English for Nurses at the Medical College of
         Virginia (1951-1953); Virginia Public Schools in Richmond at
         Armstrong High School and Maggie L. Walker High School
         (1951-1959); Rutgers State University, Douglass College
         (1960-1963); and at Middlesex County College from 1966 until
         her retirement, in 1983, as professor of English.</p>
      <p>In addition to her educational work, she also was
         occasionally employed part-time writing for 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Ebony-Jet,
         Afro-American</title>Newspapers in Richmond, Virginia, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Journal and Guide Weekly</title>, and
         as a columnist for Virginia Today, 1951-1953. From 1964-1966,
         Stuart worked as an educational research specialist for the
         ITT - Federal Electric Company Kilmer Job Corps Center in New
         Jersey (Boxes 38-39). Stuart was a member of the Delta Sigma
         Theta Sorority and a charter member of Delta Sigma Theta at
         Virginia Union University. Material related to her long
         membership in the Delta Sigma Sorority is present in Boxes
         12-14.</p>
      <p>Alice Jackson Stuart was married first to Julian Towns
         Houston, Sr. in April 1940, and they had one son, Julian Towns
         Houston. Her second marriage was to Dr. James Earle Stuart on
         November 12, 1960. Files about the career and death of Dr.
         Stuart can be found in Boxes 18 and 19.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers of Alice Jackson Houston Stuart (1913-2001), an
         educator and early Virginia civil rights figure, consist of
         ca. 19,200 items (64 Hollinger boxes, ca. 26.5 linear shelf
         feet), ca. 1930-2001, and some printed material from the
         nineteenth century. The collection includes correspondence,
         biographical information, topical files, research files,
         organizational and professional files, original writings by
         Alice Jackson Stuart and her son, Julian Houston, and papers
         and photographs pertaining to the career of her second
         husband, Doctor James Earle Stuart, and his estate.</p>
      <p>The correspondence series consists chiefly of personal
         correspondence with friends and family, invitations to social
         events, greeting cards, and post cards. Of particular note in
         the series are letters pertaining to her educational
         opportunities during her career (Box 1), especially an early
         letter from Charles Houston, October 13, 1936, advising her
         about the amount the state of Virginia was offering to pay to
         enable her to attend Columbia University.</p>
      <p>Other notable files include the correspondence of Alice
         Jackson with her parents, 1935-1939 (Box 5), letters
         pertaining to her professional career (Box 8), speaking
         opportunities (Box 9) and a small VIP file of correspondence
         (Box 9) including: Mary McLeod Bethune, Edward W. Brooke,
         W.E.B. DuBois (copy only), Michael S. Dukakis, Lena Horne,
         Robert F. Kennedy, Mrs. Ada MacLeish on behalf of her husband,
         Archibald MacLeish, Isabel Powell (wife of Adam Clayton
         Powell), Dan Quayle, Barbara Summers, Mary Church Terrell, and
         Harrison A. Williams, Jr.</p>
      <p>The series on personal and family materials includes
         Stuart's address and telephone books; calendar and appointment
         books; all types of biographical and autobiographical
         information; membership and involvement in the Delta Sigma
         Theta Sorority; diplomas; news clippings about Stuart;
         membership cards; obituaries and funeral programs for friends
         (arranged chronologically) with a separate folder for
         Spottswood W. Robinson, III; photographs (only a few of Alice
         Jackson Stuart are present) and slides; plaques, chiefly about
         membership in the National Association for the Advancement of
         Colored People; programs to various events, arranged by type;
         government resolutions concerning Stuart; various travel
         folders; and material about Dr. James Earle Stuart.</p>
      <p>The third series consist of notes made by Alice Jackson
         Stuart or completed articles, essays, drafts of her book on
         the baseball player Don Newcombe, high school and college
         class papers, her Masters thesis on John Milton, play
         adaptations, newspapers articles, poetry, speeches, including
         one at the University of Virginia Office of Afro-American
         Affairs Honors Banquet, and short stories. The notes are
         arranged by topic when apparent, and include college course
         notes, notes for classes she taught, notes about teaching,
         black history and culture, and other personal interests.</p>
      <p>Series four is the largest series and contains subject and
         topical files. The largest groups of these are concerned with
         her long career of teaching at the Middlesex County College,
         Edison, New Jersey, from its beginnings until her retirement
         (Boxes 39-43); her membership and active roles in the National
         Council of Teachers of English and the associated Conference
         on College Composition and Communication, where Stuart served
         on the Executive committee, 1972-1975 (Boxes 44-47); and Dr.
         and Mrs. Stuart's public and community service to Plainfield,
         New Jersey (Boxes 48-50).</p>
      <p>Other files reveal her interest in race relations, the
         arts, black history and culture, various educational issues,
         civil rights and civil rights organizations, the Democratic
         Party, membership in the First Unitarian Church of Richmond,
         Virginia, and Plainfield, New Jersey, social issues, including
         housing and urban renewal, various museums, human relations,
         application to the University of Virginia in 1935 (Box 54), L.
         Douglas Wilder (Box 56), and Virginia Union University (Box
         55-56).</p>
      <p>Another item of note in series four is the World War II
         diary and letters, 1943-1944, of a black serviceman, Granver
         Paige Thomas (1923-?), a member of Company B, 1313th Engineer
         Regiment, General Service, who was stationed at Fort George E.
         Meade, on July 24, 1943, and transferred to Camp Claiborne,
         Louisiana, on August 5, 1943 (see Box 54). The diary describes
         his basic training in great detail from the time he entered
         service in July until he was shipped out from Camp Claiborne
         in January 1944 in preparation of going to England. The
         letters are from Thomas to his mother, Mrs. Anna V. Cutts,
         while he was stationed in England in 1944.</p>
      <p>The fifth series of educational files and research
         materials includes bibliographies, syllabi, and files with
         educational topics, such as curriculum reform, the gifted
         child, grading, the junior and community college, low income
         students, the possible impact of television and radio upon
         education, reading, testing, vocabulary and spelling, and
         writing and composition, among others.</p>
      <p>There are also files of research material about Africa;
         black artists; blacks in education and medical fields; black
         history, literature, media, theater, musicians, singers, and
         other performers; the Caribbean Islands and their literature;
         the civil rights movement; women's studies; the Civil War, and
         Richmond.</p>
      <p>Research folders on individuals include: Roland Hayes,
         Langston Hughes, John Keats, Alice Dunbar Nelson and Maggie
         Lena Walker.</p>

      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>Much of the printed material that came with the papers but
         did not relate specifically to Stuart or her professional
         career was separated and transferred to Rare Books for
         individual cataloging and handling. Five series were then
         created based on the type of material present. All material
         marked as oversize in the box listing are actually stored in
         oversize boxes separate from the collection. Please ask staff
         members for assistance in requesting these items.</p>
      <p>These papers are arranged in five series, including:
