      <p>Rita Mae Brown was born in Hanover, Pennsylvania, on
         November 28, 1944, and was adopted by Ralph and Julia Ellen
         (Buckingham) Brown. Her family moved to Florida when she was
         eleven, and she graduated from Fort Lauderdale High School in
         1962. She attended the University of Florida, Broward Junior
         College (A.A. in 1965), New York University (B.A. 1968), and
         the Institute for Policy Studies, Washington, D.C. (Ph.D.
         1976).</p>
      <p>While chiefly identified as a writer, especially as the
         author of the groundbreaking and successful novel 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Rubyfruit Jungle</title>(1973),
         featuring the lesbian character, Molly Bolt, Rita Mae Brown is
         also known as a political activist, feminist, speaker, and
         founder of such groups as the Redstockings Radical Feminist
         Group, National Gay Task Force, the National Women's Political
         Caucus, and co-founder of Radical Lesbians and Lavender
         Menace. She is also a co-founder with Charlotte Bunch of an
         experiment in communal living in Washington, D. C. called the
         Furies Collective, and an early member of NOW.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection comprises the papers of writer Rita Mae
         Brown (1944-), of Nelson County, Virginia, ca. 31,550 items
         (188 Hollinger boxes, 78 linear feet), ca. 1929-2001, and
         undated, and includes manuscripts of her novels and other
         books, poetry, articles, mysteries, book reviews, screenplays
         and teleplays; fan mail, personal, family and professional
         correspondence; calendar diaries, personal journals,
         photographs, and memorabilia items; legal papers; and other
         miscellaneous subject files, reflecting her interest in her
         farm, polo, film, foxhunting, feminist and gay rights issues,
         and her school and college years.</p>
      <p>The bulk of her collection primarily consists of the
         typescripts of her books, arranged by title; screenplays and
         teleplays, both original scripts and rewrites; and other
         literary works such as articles, short stories, book reviews,
         interviews with Brown and examples of her early poetry, some
         of which was published in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Songs to a Handsome Woman</title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Hand That Cradles a Rock</title>.
         These have been arranged in Series I: Literary Papers and
         Manuscripts.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, complete manuscripts for some of her early
         and best known work are not present. The titles of works not
         represented in this collection of papers include: 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Rubyfruit Jungle</title>, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Starting From Scratch</title>, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sudden Death</title>, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">In Her Day</title>, and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Plain Brown Rapper</title>.</p>
      <p>With the publication of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Wish You Were Here</title>in 1990,
         Brown began writing in a new genre, co-authoring with her cat
         Sneaky Pie a new mystery series set in Crozet, Virginia, that
         has proved popular and enduring. This series of books is well
         represented in the manuscripts series.</p>
      <p>Manuscripts for almost all of her screenplays and teleplays
         are present in the collection and represent a significant part
         of her work. Rita Mae Brown earned a Cinematography Degree in
         1968 from the New York School of Visual Arts. She was
         nominated for an Emmy for Best Variety Show on Television and
         received the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Variety
         Show on Television, both for "I Love Liberty" in 1982. Her
         work on "The Long Hot Summer" ganered her a nomination for an
         Emmy for Best Mini-Series, 1985. She has authored scripts for
         ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX Network, Walt Disney, Showtime, 20th
         Century Fox, Hallmark, and Alvin Cooperman Productions, among
         others.</p>
      <p>The second series includes several subseries of
         correspondence. The greeting cards and fan mail are arranged
         chronologically, as are the many requests for Rita Mae Brown
         for public appearances and speeches, donations of money and
         goods, and comments regarding other authors' work for book
         blurbs or publicity. Some requests for Brown's participation
         generated enough material that either she or the processor has
         placed it in an individual folder under the name of the event,
         following the routine request folders.</p>
      <p>Her personal correspondence is also arranged
         chronologically and includes the years from 1966 until today.
         Because of the amount of material, frequency of
         correspondence, name recognition, or because Brown had a
         separate folder for some correspondents, the processor has set
         up a subseries of folders devoted to individual
         correspondents, found in boxes 153-164. No claim is made that
         this is a complete or exhaustive list of important or notable
         correspondents. This separate subseries includes
         correspondence with her publishers Rowohlt, Ballatine
         Publishing Group and Bantam Dell Publishing; other authors;
         family members, such as her aunt and uncle, Jeun and Claude
         Brown; her aunt Mary Dundore, and her mother, Julia Brown,
         both of whom form the basis for the sisters in her novels, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Bingo"</title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Six of One</title>; film producers and
         entertainers; other feminists; friends; her agents, Stu
         Robinson and Wendy Weil; political figures; athletes; and
         artists. A complete list of these individuals can be found in
         the folder listing.</p>
      <p>The third series contains calendar diaries; a journal kept
         by her mother, Julia Brown, about Rita Mae Brown as a small
         child; early journals kept by Rita Mae Brown, 1975-1983;
         memorablilia; photographs of Rita Mae Brown and her family and
         friends; many of various pets and animals; foxhunting and
         others sporting events.</p>
      <p>The last series consists of various subject and legal
         files, including her work in the film industry, contracts and
         agreements about her books, curriculum vitae and biographical
         information, Farmington and Oak Ridge Hunt Clubs,
         horse-related business interests, polo clubs and associations,
         royalty statements, high school and college papers, notes,
         report cards, and diplomas, and legal papers involving Martina
         Navratilova, Judy Nelson, Julia Penelope, Josie Martin, Diana
         Press, and her properties in Los Angeles, Albemarle County,
         Virginia, and Nelson County, Virginia.</p>
