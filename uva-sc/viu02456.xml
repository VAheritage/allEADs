          <p>Thanks her for her Christmas letter which reached him
               on Christmas Day, relays his latest scheme for a future
               in French aviation when demobilized, "That would furnish
               me a life with some excitement, a chance to read and
               write as much as I like and put me in touch with people
               worth knowing. I would perfect my French, see a lot of
               things worthwhile - not to mention the gorgeous uniform
               I'd wear." He goes on to write about his afternoon in a
               family second story cafe, reading and sketching a
               stork's nest, and talking to other customers; refers to
               an article by Burns Mantle about the New York theatre,
               which he misses; he mentions some of their common
               acquaintances; and speaks of his changed viewpoint, "It
               has been very lucky for me that the war caught me when
               it did for its changed my views on a lot of things, for
               the better."</p>

          <p>On a heavily censored page (a portion is cut out), he
               mentions an old abbey used as quarters for his division,
               comments about his finances, "Considering that I'm
               touring France with board and room paid, I have plenty
               of money," and expresses pity for his censor.</p>

          <p>He vividly describes the constant barrage experienced
               during the Aisne-Marne Offensive begun by the French
               following the Second Battle of the Marne, mentioning the
               town of Soissons, and his activities as an American
               ambulance driver attached to the French Army on the
               Western front during World War I, driving a Ford to pick
               up wounded along the front lines, "Nothing can be so
               horrible as having a motor stop in a mauvais coin when
               you are well loaded with wounded. It is so terrible a
               responsibility that at times I think I shall go mad. And
               here the roads have been terrible on account of the
               constant bombardment and the mines."</p>

          <p>Bromfield writes that he has moved into a quiet
               sector, quite a change from his previous involvement in
               action at the Western Front, and describes how his
               division longs for peace, "Perhaps you, more than most,
               can begin to realize the sadness and horror of it but to
               really feel the satisfaction of the dawning of peace,
               one must have seen the frightful hopelessness of a
               battle at its worst. You know how sick I have felt at
               times...And one is very proud of being an American.
               Quite honestly Edith, and without the spirit of
               boastfulness, we have done more than you can believe to
               bring it to a hasty close. Whatever one may say of
               Germany, it must be granted that she is a nation of
               large ideas and large conceptions. Only a nation of big
               conceptions could defeat her..." He sums up his
               experiences by saying, "This year has been 'The
               Wonderful Year' of my life. It has been the greatest
               experience I have ever had. Now that I have been to
               Alsace, I have seen all the Western Front, Amiens,
               Rheims, Soissons, Chateau-Thierry, [Viller-Cotterets ?],
               Chemin des Dames, Ypres, Poperinghe, the Somme,
               Compiegne, the Aisne, the Marne - all those and many
               more I have seen when they were most uncomfortable!! And
               I have been thru it all with the French army or with the
               British and Belgians. I have carried Germans, Austrians,
               Belgians, French, British, Americans, Arabs, Senegalese
               - lived in the same houses with the Foreign Legion,
               dined in Paris at the Cafe de la Paix with all the world
               - all that in a scant eleven months and I think I have
               made good my opportunity."</p>

               Y.M.C.A. stationery about a play he is involved with in
               Tours, "Our play opened here last night and made a
               tremendous hit. It is really a jolly production with
               corking music and some gowns. The girls are really
               wonderful." He also mentions traveling back to Paris to
               play a week at the Champs Elysees Theatre, and then on
               to Brussells and London, before returning to Paris. He
               hopes to spend the summer at the Sorbonne.</p>
