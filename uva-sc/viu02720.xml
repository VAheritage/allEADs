         funds.</p>
         <p>There are several items pertaining to various military
         units: the Virginia Militia, 100th Regiment, regarding courts
         of enquiry and fines, 1805, 1811-1826, and 1840; an affadavit

         notes, receipts, documents regarding the sale of slaves, the
         administration of estates, and the leather tanning business,

         <p>Prominent family members in these papers include John T.
         Bocock, George C. Christian, Dr. William Christian
         (1808-1880), Lucy Diuguid, William diuguid, William Stephens
         (ca. 1799-1845), Albert Thornhill (1819- 1886), Jesse
         Thornhill (1822-1857), and Thomas T. Thornhill
         (1785-1847).</p>
         <p>Nearly half of the collection consists of the papers of
         Thomas S. Bocock (1815-1891). He was a son of John Thomas (a
         member of the Virginia General Assembly 1818-1820 and
         1828-1830) and Mary (Flood) Bocock, and was born in Buckingham
         County (later Appomattox County). After having been educated
         by private tutors under the direction of his brother, Willis
         P. Bocock (1807-1887), who eventually became attorney general
         of Virginia, he graduated from Hampden-Sydney College in 1838.
         He then studied law and began his practice at Buckingham Court
         House. He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from
         1842 to 1845, and was the commonwealth's attorney for
         Appomattox County in 1845 and 1846. Bocock married Sarah P.
         Flood in 1846; after her death he married Annie Faulkner, the
         daughter of Charles James Faulkner, minister to France under
         President James Buchanan. [Faulkner's papers are largely in
         the Virginia Historical Society, Richmond; many of his
         son's--Annie's brother--are held by this Library.] Elected as
         a Democrat to Congress, he served from 1847 to 1861, and was
         chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs for ten years;
         Bocock was the Democratic candidate for Speaker of the House
         in 1859 and 1860.</p>
         <p>He was a Virginia delegate to the Provisional Confederate
         Congress from 1861 to 1862 and was Speaker of the Confederate
         House of Representatives from 1862 to 1865; he also acted as a
         liaison officer between the government and the Army of
         Northern Virginia. After the war he resumed his law practice
         and was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of
         1868, 1876, and 1880. He again served in the Virginia House of
         Delegates from 1877 to 1878. During the 1880's he was an
         attorney for railroad companies including the Atlantic,
         Mississippi and Ohio, and the Richmond and Allegheny. He was
         also a member of the board of Hampden- Sydney College and the
         Board of Visitors, Blacksburg Agricultural and Mechanical
         College. Bocock died on August 5, 1891, in Appomattox County
         at his estate, "Wildway," and was buried in Old Bocock
         Cemetery. Further information about his life and career may be
