      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection of 317 items, 1823-1930, contains chiefly
         letters to 
         <persname>Fannie Tompkins Childress</persname>. Fannie was
         originally from " 
         <corpname>Caroline</corpname>" in 
         <geogname>Spotsylvania County</geogname>, but after her
         marriage to 
         <persname>J. Waller Childress</persname>she moved around quite
         frequently.</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>Fannie Tompkins Childress</persname>from her
         relatives are mainly concerned with family affairs. One of
         February 19, 1872 mentions the marriage of 
         <persname>Aurelius Rose</persname>to 
         <persname>Bettie Bearyley</persname>on January 20. Another
         mentions the marriage of Fannie's nephew 
         <persname>Thomas Durrett</persname>(born September 23, 1873)
         to 
         <persname>Jessie Frazer</persname>on November 14, 1893
         (October 19, 1893).</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>Fannie Tompkins Childress</persname>from her sister 
         <persname>Margaret J. Tompkins Childress Durett</persname>are
         mostly concerned with family relations. A number of the
         letters refer to Margaret's experience raising chickens which
         was not very profitable for her; from the references Fannie
         also engaged in this occupation. In addition, a number of the
         letters refer to the poor health of Margaret and her family.
         Two letters speak of the marriage of Margaret's daughter 
         <persname>Fannie Durett</persname>to 
         <persname>William Tribble</persname>in January 1900 (January 5
         and February 21, 1900.) Margaret and her husband were greatly
         upset at this marriage, but later restored normal relations. A
         n.d. letter mentions the death of Margaret's husband and the
         pain it caused.</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>Fannie Tompkins Childress</persname>from her husband
         <persname>J. Waller Childress</persname>are courtship letters.
         They met on November 2, 1871 and were married November 6,
         1872. During most of that period they did not see each
         other.</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>Fannie Tompkins Childress</persname>from her sons, 
         <persname>Robert Waller Childress</persname>and 
         <persname>Clifford Childress</persname>, are mostly requests
         for their mother to do something for them.</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>Fannie Tompkins Childress</persname>from Dr. 
         <persname>James B. Manson</persname>are love letters. James
         was originally from 
         <geogname>Georgia</geogname>, and met Fannie during the Civil
         War. Manson, a married man with one child, became quite
         infatuated with Fannie. The early letters mention Sherman's
         drive through 
         <geogname>Georgia</geogname>; letters of January 9 and March
         10, 1870 mention the postwar conditions of farmers in 
         <geogname>Georgia</geogname>. A January 13, 1871 letter
         mentions a black revolt and the Ku Klux Klan, the success of
         the Democrats in congressional elections of 1870, and the
         Franco-Prussian War.</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>Fannie Tompkins Childress</persname>from her cousin 
         <persname>James Tompkins</persname>were written during the
         Civil War. However, very little of interest was discussed.
         One, September 26, 1862, mentions all the people in his
         regiment that have been killed or wounded.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous letters to 
         <persname>Fannie Tompkins Childress</persname>contain two
         letters referring to 
         <persname>Robert E. Lee</persname>, and two letters,
         1868-1869, to 
         <persname>Thomas Garland</persname>of 
         <geogname>Albemarle County</geogname>from 
         <persname>Henry Horatio Wells</persname>and 
         <persname>Ale[xander?] Rives</persname>re appointments and
         political amnesty.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous Papers of the 
         <famname>Terrell family</famname>contain epitaphs for two
         children who died, 
         <persname>Junius Smith Tyler Terrell</persname>on August 22,
         1833 and 
         <persname>Lucy Ann Terrell</persname>on November 1, 1837.</p>
      <p>Business Papers contain bills and receipts and some letters
         concerning the sale of property owned by 
         <persname>Frances C. Marshall</persname>after her death.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous material contains four photographs and an
         obituary of 
         <persname>Fannie Tompkins Childress</persname>.</p>
