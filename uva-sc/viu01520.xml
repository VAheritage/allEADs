      <p>The 7th Maine was organized at Augusta on 21 August 1861 as
         a three-years' infantry regiment. During the period of
         Atkinson's letters it was led by Colonel Edwin C. Mason and
         served at White Oak Church, and participated the battles of
         Chancellorsville (May 1863), Gettysburg (June-July 1863), and
         Bristoe Station campaigns (August-October 1863). It later
         participated in 1864 Virginia campaigns including the
         Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, and Jubal
         Early's attack on Washington. It was mustered out on 21 August
         1864, but several of its veterans and recruits were enrolled
         as the 1st Maine Veteran Volunteers (First Regiment Maine
         Veteran Infantry/1st Maine Veteran Infantry) at Charlestown,
         Virginia.¹</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of six letters of Leroy Atkinson,
         a member of Company B, 7th Maine Volunteers, to his parents
         while stationed at Washington, D. C., and Virginia, 1863-1865.
         He describes camp life, daily activities, and his impressions
         of the war.</p>
      <p>The majority of the letters are to his mother. On 27
         January 1863 Atkinson writes from Washington, D. C., enclosing
         $150.00 for her; he describes the regiment as being at the
         "retreat"¹ and that it will leave for
         Fredericksburg, Virginia, on the morrow. (This stationery
         bears an engraving of the U. S. Capitol building.) On 11 May
         1863 Atkinson, writing from [White] Oak Church, Virginia,
         tells his mother of the Army of the Potomac's movements and
         fighting near Fredericksburg during and after the battle of
         Chancellorsville, including the use of pontoons and the
         capture of Confederate prisoners; only thirty-six men are left
         in his regiment.</p>
      <p>Atkinson encloses $25.00 for his mother in his letter of 12
         June 1863 while at Fredericksburg; his division had captured
         Confederate positions but the following morning 40,000 rebels
         were entrenched in the retaken positions [a result of fighting
         at Marye's Heights]. In a letter written at Warrenton on 16
         August 1863 to his father Atkinson briefly mentions his
         regiment's experiences at the battle of Gettysburg.</p>
      <p>His letter of 13 September 1863 (he is still in Warrenton)
         to his mother states that the cavalry had gone to Culpeper
         that morning and the sound of cannons can be heard in the
         distance [this was the beginning of fighting at Brandy
         Station, Muddy Run, Culpeper Court House, Pony Mountain and
         Stevensburg, part of the Bristoe campaign]; at this time the
         7th Maine was assigned to the Army of the Potomac's VI Army
         Corps, Second Division, Third Brigade.² Atkinson
         asks his mother to pay his wife Martha's debts for him
         inasmuch as "she is very mad because I did not send her any
         money"; this letter also contains a brief reply from Martha
         who discusses payment of bills.</p>
      <p>Atkinson's last letter, from Brandy Station, Virginia, 24
         January 1864, approves of his mother's move to Cornsville; as
         for regimental news several deserters have been executed and
         more sentenced to receive the same punishment; he expects
         veterans (such as himself) will be granted furloughs but in
         the meantime the regiment is on guard duty. There is a another
         reply by Martha in response to one of his letters (not
         present): "i am going to send you some nedels [needles]/Come
         home do for i want to see you very much."</p>
      <p>¹ Atkinson is probably referring to the
         Soldiers' Home, Abraham Lincoln's presidential retreat located
         north of Washington in a wooded area three miles from the
         White House and used by him to escape the heat and humidity of
         the city. It was sometimes known as the Soldiers' Retreat
         because military units occasionally encamped there.
