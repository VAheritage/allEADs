      <p>This collection consists of the papers of Virginia Military
         Institute professor, William B. Blair (1817-1883), of
         Lexington, Virginia, a U.S. Army officer, 1838-1861, who was
         cited for gallantry at the Battle of Cerro Gordo in the
         Mexican War and who served as a major in the commissary
         service of the Confederate States of America Army, 1861-1865,
         and his family, ca. 160 items, ranging in date from
         1860-1914.</p>
      <p>The papers contain business correspondence, financial, and
         legal papers, chiefly pertaining to the business affairs and
         the settling of the estates of William B. Blair and his
         brother, Henry W. Blair. The correspondence includes several
         letters from his friend, F. McC. Newton, San Antonio, Texas,
         about Blair's business affairs in Texas, 1870-1877; a
         reference to the Presidential election, predicting Texas would
         go for Horace Greeley (1872 Jul 17); the estate of Mr. Barret
         (1873 Dec 18); and a plea from an old class mate, Dr. John T.
         Metcalf, of New York City, asking Blair to take an interest in
         his relative, Sherburne Choppin, attending the Virginia
         Military Institute, and mentioning that he had "many utterly
         impoverished kinfolk to provide for, in my destitute portion
         of the South" (1876 Oct 30).</p>
      <p>Also present are military documents signed by Blair as a
         U.S. commissary officer stationed in San Antonio, Texas, in
         1860, authorizing payments for supplies, labor, and other
         items, and also signed by other junior officers in southern
         Texas. These documents were used in evidence in a longevity
         pay claim made by his descendants in 1914.</p>
      <p>Financial and legal papers contain accounts, receipts, tax
         receipts, and bills, of William B. Blair, and of his wife,
         Judith C. Blair, and the account of William A. Anderson,
         executor of the estate of Henry W. Blair, the brother of
         William B. Blair (1885 Mar 6 &amp; May 20).</p>
