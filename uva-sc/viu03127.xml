      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This is a manuscript notebook, ca. 1850, containing
         sketches by Kate [Catherine Steptoe] Burwell and text of
         ["Editor Loquitor"] relating to scenes and events near
         Bedford, Virginia. There are eighteen pen- and-ink sketches
         with text; fifteen are signed by Kate Burwell.</p>
      <p>William McCreery Burwell (1809-1888) and Frances Steptoe
         Burwell built "Avenel" (ca. 1838) in Liberty (now Bedford),
         Virginia. Burwell was the editor of the Virginia Patriot in
         the 1850s. William M. Burwell's father, William Armistead
         Burwell, was Thomas Jefferson's private secretary during his
         presidency. Frances Steptoe Burwell's father and grandfather
         ("Jemmy" Steptoe) were early clerks of the court in Bedford
         County and also associated with Jefferson. The issue of
         William McCreery Burwell and Frances Steptoe Burwell are:
         Letitia McCreery (1831-1905); Catherine "Kate" Steptoe
         (1833-1899); Mary Frances (1839-1862); James Steptoe
         (1842-1843); and, Rosalie (1845- ).</p>
      <p>This notebook was brought to the Bedford Historical
         Society, Inc. by James R. Dillon, Jr. of Atlanta, Georgia, who
         received the book from his father's first cousin Mary Unity
         Dillon (died ca. 1988) of Indian Rock, Virginia. It was among
         Miss Dillon's collection of local and regional items. She was
         acquainted with the Burwell family and may have been related
         to the Steptoe family. The Bedford Historical Society, Inc.
         gave the book to the Avenel Foundation, Inc. of Bedford,
         Virginia, because of the relationship of Kate Burwell to the
         home.</p>
