         <head>Scope and Content
</head>
         <p>This collection contains 33 items, 1869-1924, including letters, diaries and scrapbooks, of Rev. James Rankin, Minister of Muthill, Perthshire, Scotland.
</p>
         <p>There are twenty-four letters from Rankin written chiefly to Louisa Caird (McCullough) Paterson, 1869-1870, first asking her to become his wife and then involving plans for their wedding and married life. Their
marriage, which took place on April 19, 1870, began as a practical arrangement and gradually developed into a more affectionate relationship as shown throughout the letters. Also included are carte-de-visite
photographs of the Rankins.
</p>
         <p>The diaries, journal, and letterbook, 1880-1881, kept by Rankin, concerning his trip to Nyasaland, Africa to investigate charges against the Blantyre Mission. The Church of Scotland's Foreign Mission Committee
sent him to Blantyre, and gave him the authority to make necessary changes. It was also requested of Lord Granville, the Foreign Secretary, that H. E. O'Neill, the British Consul in Mozambique, assist Rankin.
Because O'Neill was ill, a lawyer named Alexander Pringle was appointed to act as Deputy Commissioner. This investigation was the result of a pamphlet published by a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society,
Andrew Chirnside, who had been visiting Blantyre and observed the inhuman treatment of natives.
</p>
         <p>On June 29, 1880, Rankin set out for East Africa, and kept a diary of his trip, including in it records of supplies and medicines, and of passage by train and steamer. While traveling through the various cities
and countries-Paris, France; Turin, Ancona, Bologna, and Brindisi, Italy; Alexandria and Suez, Egypt; and Aden, Arabia-Rankin briefly described cities and railway stations and included a few rough sketches of
houses, buildings, and furniture.
</p>
         <p>On July 14, 1880, Rankin left Aden on the S. S. <title render="italic">Abyssinia </title>on his way to Zanzibar, Mozambique, and Quelimane, Africa. While in Mozambique, Rankin visited the British Consul, H. E.
O'Neill, who had been instructed to assist him by the Foreign Office. O'Neill introduced Rankin to the Governor-General who sent a letter to the Governor of Quelimane, Jose S'A.S' Avila, requesting that he also
assist O'Neill and his party in any way possible. Upon arriving in Quelimane, Rankin was met by Vice-Consul Nunez. During his stay in Mozambique and Quelimane, Rankin made observations about the status of the
natives as well as the opinions of the men in government with whom he spoke. The governments of Zanzibar, Mozambique, and Quelimane were cooperative with each other and the investigation, especially since they
wished to keep the problems of the mission from the Portuguese, lest they claim jurisdiction at Blantyre. There had been gradual liberation of slaves in Mozambique and Quelimane during 1872-1877, but some natives
asked to be returned to their former owners because their life was so difficult under Portuguese rule. They were made to pay an excessive poll tax, and forced to live in huts with small gardens because the land
belonged to the government and there was no cultivation allowed by the natives beyond their own needs. It was believed that for the most part the missions were for the good of the natives, and that the natives
should be kept from Portuguese rule. Rankin also made note of discussions concerning the charges at Blantyre.
</p>
         <p>Once at Blantyre, Rankin inspected the station, including the buildings, garden, fields, operations, and villages, and spoken with members of the staff. He made notes on the prison including measurements,
things growing in the garden, stories of floggings, the neglectfulness of the Messrs. Moir (managers of the Livingstonia Central Africa Company), the irregularity of the mails, refusal to pay the proper price for
canoes, reduced wages, and other problems.
</p>
         <p>While Deputy Commissioner Alexander Pringle began taking depositions at Blantyre in September 1880, a party consisting of Henry Henderson, John Buchanan, and Rankin set out in search of a site for a new station
suitable for work among the Makololo.
</p>
         <p>In November 1880, when the diary resumes (Volume II is missing), Rankin has left Blantyre and has begun analyzing the depositions and writing an outline of the Blantyre cases for his report.
</p>
         <p>The letterbook kept from May-October 1880 includes newspaper clippings and letters to the editor as well as handwritten copies of letters concerning charges against the Blantyre Mission. There are letters among
Rankin, Alexander Pringle, James C. Herdman, and Andrew Chirnside, including instructions from Herdman to Rankin on his investigation of Blantyre, and an agreement between the Rev. Duff McDonald, head of the
Blantyre Mission and Messrs. J. &amp; F. Moir, managers of the Livingstonia Central Africa Company.
</p>
         <p>There are also two scrapbooks of newspaper clippings, one of which concerns the Scottish Church Mission in Nyasaland, Muthill in Perthshire, Scotland, and Normandy during 1892-1895, and the other, 1912-1924,
contains articles about characters of Todlowrie, and essays and poems from Scottish newspapers.
</p>
