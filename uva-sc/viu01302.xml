      <p>The father of James D. Johnston, Sr. was Colonel Andrew
         Johnston (1770-?), the youngest of three sons born to David
         and Nannie Abbot Johnston, in Culpeper County, Virginia,
         before the family settled in Giles County in 1778. Andrew
         Johnston became a successful merchant and owner of real estate
         at Pearisburg, marrying Jane Henderson of Montgomery County,
         Virginia, who bore him three sons and two daughters.</p>
      <p>James D. Johnston, Sr. was a student at Emory and Henry
         College, where he earned degrees of Bachelor of Arts and
         Master of Arts, graduating in 1848, studied law under private
         tutelage and was admitted to the Giles County bar at the age
         of twenty-one. He later served on the Emory and Henry College
         Board of Trustees. Johnston also served Giles County as
         commonwealth's attorney for nine years and in the Virginia
         House of Delegates from 1877-1879. In 1855, he married Mary A.
         Fowler (?-1905), daughter of Dr. Thomas Fowler, of Monroe,
         Summers County, West Virginia and [Kizziah ?] Chapman. James
         D. Johnston, Sr. and Mary Fowler had the following children:
         Roberta P. (Johnston) Izard; Allene Johnston, James D.
         Johnston, Jr. (1869- ?), Sidney Fowler Johnston, and Mamie
         Elise (Johnston) Jameson. The Johnston family moved to Roanoke
         in 1891, where James D. Johnston, Jr., a graduate of the
         University of Virginia Law School (1891-1893) became
         associated with his father in the practice of law with offices
         in both Pearisburg and Roanoke. In 1913, he married Elizabeth
         Sinclair Whittle, of Martinsville, Virginia, daughter of Judge
         Stafford G. and Ruth Drewry Whittle.</p>
