      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>In a series of letters from Peter Taylor to Robie Macauley,
         July 1946 through October 1947, Peter Taylor critiques one of
         Macauley's short stories and describes his own teaching
         opportunities, works in progress, and infatuation with
         playwriting. He also discusses the need for a literary
         magazine edited by someone under forty who can recognize new
         talent; his "grand revolt against impressionist dogma" and his
         plans to purchase and remodel the homeplace of his wife's
         family.</p>
      <p>There is also a letter, 1947 December 11, Taylor,
         Greensboro, N.C., to Macauley mentioning speeches to be made
         by John Crowe Ransom, Randall Jarrell and others at the Arts
         Forum of the Women's College of the University of North
         Carolina in the spring and Robert Penn Warren's difficulty in
         writing an introduction to Taylor's second book.</p>
      <p>In addition, in a letter, 1948 April 22, Taylor mentions
         that 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Sewanee Review</title>will be
         printing his first play and that he finds playwriting his best
         method of expression.</p>
