      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection, 1954-1983, consists chiefly of letters
         from Virginia artist Charles William Smith and his wife, Nora,
         to William and Madeleine Moss. Smith frequently writes
         concerning his painting and other work, including continued
         participation in University of Virginia matters, following his
         retirement as chairman of the Department of Art. Over the
         years, 1968-1983, Smith writes that he has been painting
         nearly everyday. In 1968, he mentions working on committees
         and doing consulting work at the University. During 1970, he
         mentions his decision to not have his exhibition, as the
         artistic (and other) return is often not worth the work
         involved and his mural for the bank in Richmond being
         completed. A letter in 1971 refers to the Virginia Museum and
         its attempt to raise funds, apparently in answer to
         Madeleine's inquiry concerning a dance idea she wanted to
         propose to the Museum. In 1972, he mentions that Lewis Mumford
         (1895- ) is in Charlottesville and is to receive the Thomas
         Jefferson medal for outstanding work in architecture. He also
         expresses concern for the state of affairs throughout the
         country, commenting that "nothing is ever settled by law, but
         only thru love of each other - Black - White - Jew -Gentile,
         etc." In 1973, he is doing a large job for the University's
         Cabell Hall, twenty years after originally doing the colors.
         In 1976, he mentions work being done on a monograph of his
         work in teaching and work as a professional artist. There is
         an interesting letter, December 1977, expressing Smith's
         thoughts on art faculty of institutions. He writes, "I think
         (sometime) that there are so many students that there are not
         enough good faculty to go around - most of them are failures
         in the field in which they wished to work, but found to their
         amazement that they could not making a living in what they
         want to do and 'took up' teaching in order to make a living -
         that I know is true in art - fortunately I have been able in a
         small [way] managed to teach and paint." In 1978, he comments
         on interesting things happening in Vermont compared to
         Virginia, where "some (a lot) of people here spend so much
         time being Virginians..." and Smith genealogy. Smith also
         expresses thoughts on pursuing a career in the entertainment
         or art field and gives advice to Madeleine concerning her
         desire to be involved in professional dancing. During
         1979-1980, Smith continues painting and selling his artwork to
         interested patrons. He mentions the University has purchased
         some of his paintings for the library in the new law school.
         Letters during 1983 are more personal and reveal the infirmity
         of Charles William and Nora Smith.</p>
      <p>There are examples of the artwork of Charles William Smith,
         in the form of greeting cards or notes; a keepsake printed at
         the Cockescraw Press for a luncheon honoring Smith on May 30,
         1963; newspaper clippings; and autograph envelopes.</p>
