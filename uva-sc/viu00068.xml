      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 150 items, 1825-1936,
         concerning the 
         <famname>Trist family</famname>and 
         <famname>Burke family</famname>descended from 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>. It was purchased by the
         <corpname>Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation</corpname>for
         the Library from Messrs. 
         <persname>James Eddy</persname>, 
         <persname>Charles Eddy</persname>, and 
         <persname>John Eddy</persname>of 
         <geogname>Short Hills, New Jersey</geogname>, on January 1,
         1962.</p>
      <p>CORRESPONDENCE</p>
      <p>The 
         <famname>Burke family</famname>letters date from 1876 to 1936.
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>shows her political interests
         in her July 7, 1859 letter to her husband 
         <persname>John Burke</persname>. In referring to 
         <persname>Louis Napoleon Bonaparte</persname>she states, "I am
         glad the Austrians are getting a lesson, but it makes me
         sadder to think of the widows and orphans created by the last
         battle." 
         <persname>Mary Randolph</persname>writes 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>on February 22, 1863, saying
         that Mrs. Lesley has tried stimulants for her headache, and
         indicating that the 
         <famname>Lesley family</famname>is allopathic in its medical
         ideas. She refers to anti-Union sentiment in 
         <geogname>Boston</geogname>, saying that " 
         <persname>Henry Ward Beecher</persname>is very caustic and
         shows his usual talent in some remarks he made on the same
         subject." A letter from 
         <persname>Mary Randolph</persname>to 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>on July 17, 1863, mentions
         summer (draft) riots in 
         <geogname>New York City</geogname>, and sends a clipping, "A
         Southern View of Secession," a fraudulent anti-Confederate
         speech [said to be] by 
         <persname>Alexander Hamilton Stephens</persname>(1812-1883) of
         <geogname>Georgia</geogname>. On March 9, 1867, 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>, who lives in 
         <geogname>Alexandria</geogname>with her husband, writes to her
         aunts 
         <persname>Mary Randolph</persname>and 
         <persname>Cornelia Randolph</persname>about the "Negro"
         candidate for mayor, and her fear of the danger of "wiley"
         politicians using the "Negro" vote. In a May 7, 1895 letter, 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>writes to 
         <persname>Mary Randolph</persname>on the truth of 
         <persname>Frank Leslie</persname>'s prediction of the demise
         of the 
         <geogname>Confederate States of America</geogname>. On
         November 16, 1879, 
         <persname>Ellen Randolph Dwight</persname>writes to 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>with a description of the 
         <famname>Jefferson family</famname>and 
         <famname>Randolph family</famname>papers and a plan of the
         library at 
         <geogname>Brooks' Mouth</geogname>. The 
         <famname>Burke family</famname>correspondence drops off until
         the late 1920s with the letters of 
         <persname>Fanny M. Burke</persname>. Her letter to a Mr.
         Wingfield on January 11, 1923, shows her interest in 
         <famname>Burke family</famname>genealogy and includes a
         drawing of the 
         <famname>Burke family</famname>coat-of-arms. In a February 11,
         1923, letter to 
         <persname>Ellen [Coolidge]</persname>, she says she is
         furnishing copies of these coats-of-arms for $5 each, and
         attempts to defend a controversial chapter of her nation's and
         family's history-- 
         <persname>Nicholas P. Trist</persname>'s decision to make a
         treaty with 
         <geogname>Mexico</geogname>to end the Mexican War. In her July
         27, 1927 letter to her niece, she refutes the claim that 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>did not belong to a
         church. On September 1, 1927, she writes to Mr. 
         <persname>H. G. Johnson</persname>thanking him for a $700
         donation for the rehabilitation of 
         <corpname>Monticello</corpname>and says that temperance is
         better than prohibition for with the former there is less
         danger of abrogating the great Anglo-Saxon liberty "Every
         man's house is his castle." On December 13, 1928, 
         <persname>Fanny M. Burke</persname>shows her interest in
         political matters, writing to 
         <persname>Ellen [Coolidge]</persname>, she mentions a a dirty
         bargain in which 
         <geogname>New England</geogname>allowed the slave trade to
         continue in return for Southern support for taxation by the
         majority [the North]. There are two undated letters from 
         <persname>Archibald Cary Coolidge</persname>to her when she
         was studying art in 
         <geogname>Europe</geogname>as a young lady, encouraging her to
         study at 
         <geogname>Paris</geogname>.</p>
      <p>The letters of 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson Trist</persname>date from
         1840-1886, and n.d. The letters from 1840 through 1846 pertain
         to his sojourn at school in 
         <geogname>Philadelphia</geogname>. A letter dated August 28,
         1840, to his sister, 
         <persname>Martha Jefferson Trist</persname>, first mentions
         his schooling and his apparent longing for family. 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson Trist</persname>mentions that he
         would like to visit his father, 
         <persname>Nicholas P. Trist</persname>, in 
         <geogname>Havana, Cuba</geogname>, where he is stationed. On
         February 10, 1842, he writes to 
         <persname>Martha Jeferson Trist</persname>acknowledging
         receipt of two gifts from his parents, 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Adventures of John Smith</bibref>and 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Robinson Crusoe</bibref>, and mentions that he still
         has 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Life of Franklin</bibref>. In a October 12, 1843
         letter, he mentions his interest in Napoleonic military
         operations, preferring the French army to the English and
         Prussian. An August 22, 1844 letter to 
         <persname>Martha Jefferson Trist</persname>shows the young
         man's interest in politics, "I am for 
         <persname>[James K.] Polk</persname>, 
         <geogname>Dallas</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Texas</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Oregon</geogname>. " His letter of November 6, 1845
         reveals that he is taking drawing lessons from Mr. Holmes. He
         mentions receiving 
         <persname>Plutarch</persname>'s 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Lives</bibref>and a $2 1/2 gold piece for Christmas.
         In his February 12, 1846 letter to his sister he mentions he
         has been given an autographed picture of Gen. 
         <persname>[Zachary[ Taylor</persname>. On May 8, 1946, 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson Trist</persname>writes to his
         father, requesting a "port-folio" for his drawings. In a
         January 12, 1849 letter to his sister, we learn that 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson Trist</persname>'s interest in art
         continues and that he is studying drawing under Mr. Aime at [ 
         <corpname>Bohmon's</corpname>]. 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson Trist</persname>'s multivaried
         interests continue in his later years. Writing to his sister
         on April 2, 1876, he mentions that he took a cold after
         delivering a lecture before a literary association entitled 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">"Hans Christian Anderson."</title>He also writes her on
         November 27, 1886 saying that he has no intention of parting
         with his 
         <persname>[John] Trumbull</persname>[portrait of 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>?], and hoping that it
         will always be in the possession of 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>'s descendents. The 
         <famname>Coolidge family</famname>has the original Stuart
         profile, and 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson Trist</persname>has a photograph of
         it as well as a photograph of the 
         <persname>Thomas Sully</persname>portrait, the last one taken
         of 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>.</p>
      <p>The 
         <famname>Trist family</famname>correspondence dates from 1835
         to 1874, and pertain to the 
         <famname>Trists family</famname>'s social world and to family
         difficulties. 
         <persname>Virginia Jefferson Randolph Trist</persname>, the
         wife of 
         <persname>Nicholas P. Trist</persname>, writes to her sister, 
         <persname>Ellen Wayles Randolph Coolidge]</persname>, on
         November 26, 1835, from 
         <geogname>Washington</geogname>where 
         <persname>Nicholas P. Trist</persname>, a diplomat, is
         stationed, mentioning the "brilliant party at the president's
         on Christmas." In a letter marked "Confidential," dated
         November 14, 1862, 
         <persname>Virginia Jefferson Randolph Trist</persname>and her
         sister, 
         <persname>Mary Jefferson Randolph</persname>, write to 
         <persname>Nicholas P. Trist</persname>mentioning a concern for
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>'s baby. The Trist's daughter
         <persname>Martha Trist</persname>married 
         <persname>John Burke</persname>in the 1850s and had a daughter
         <persname>Frances "Fanny" Burke</persname>. Writing to 
         <persname>Virginia Trist</persname>on July 4th, 1863, 
         <persname>Mary Randolph</persname>mentions a chest of drawers
         containing 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>'s drawing book and two
         pictures which she wants 
         <persname>Virginia Trist</persname>to give to 
         <persname>Nicholas P. Trist</persname>.</p>
      <p>The letters of the 
         <famname>Trist family</famname>and 
         <famname>Burke family</famname>date from 1864 to 18[80]. 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>shows a concern for the
         health of her child, as evidenced in a letter to her father,
         November 12, 1862, where she is concerned over 
         <persname>Fanny Burke</persname>'s continued high fever. The
         Civil War is discussed throughout several letters. On June 14,
         1863, 
         <persname>Virginia Trist</persname>writes to 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>and tells her of fighting in 
         <geogname>Pennsylvania</geogname>, and, on four days later,
         mentioning that the possibility of a rebel attack on 
         <geogname>Harrisburg</geogname>has come to naught. A few weeks
         later, 
         <persname>Nicholas Trist</persname>writes to 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>to say that the rebel cause
         is hopeless, that 
         <geogname>Vicksburg</geogname>had fallen to "Unconditional
         Surrender" 
         <persname>Ulysses S. Grant</persname>, and the Union advances
         are progressing well. On August 15, 1863, 
         <persname>Nicholas Trist</persname>writes to 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>quoting from the 
         <corpname>London Times</corpname>, "the only thing now that
         can protract the [ ] rebellion is Copperheadism. There is also
         an undated letter, containing another reference to northern
         Copperheadism. In a letter dated only "1863," 
         <persname>Virginia Trist</persname>tells 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>about a visit with 
         <persname>Bennett Taylor</persname>who had been wounded and
         taken prisoner at 
         <geogname>Gettysburg</geogname>; and showing her
         anti-Confederate sentiment: " 
         <persname>Jefferson Davis</persname>' cruel, savage policy
         calls for retaliatory measures on the part of our government."
         In a letter of January 29, 1864, to his daughter, 
         <persname>Nicholas Trist</persname>discusses a theory
         disallowing the justification of treason (secession). 
         <persname>Virginia Trist</persname>writes to 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>on February 7, 1864, saying
         that she has heard that the "freed-man" villages at 
         <geogname>Arlington</geogname>and elsewhere were becoming
         intelligence offices for their neighbors. 
         <persname>Nicholas Trist</persname>writes to 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>on February 8, 1864,
         mentioning that 
         <geogname>Mobile</geogname>had been captured. In a letter
         dated April 9, 1872, 
         <persname>Nicholas Trist</persname>answers a request from 
         <persname>Edmund Burke</persname>. He had been asked, as a
         reminiscence, what he felt about the Wilmot Proviso. He claims
         that he could not have voted for it as it forbade slavery in a
         state after it became such, yet what state--he says--would
         have been inane enough to establish slavery if it was kept out
         when the state was a territory; and, says that he would have
         choosen the Wilmot Proviso over "Calhounism."</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous correspondence dates from 1833 to 1879, and
         n.d. Several of these were written by 
         <persname>Ellen Wayles Randolph Coolidge</persname>. In a
         letter dated January 27, a copy made by 
         <persname>Ellen Coolidge</persname>, who also wrote the
         original dated 1833/34, 
         <persname>Ellen Coolidge</persname>explains that 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>died as he had lived, a
         "Christian philosopher," and that the Gospels were the basis
         of his ideas. A copy of a letter written by 
         <persname>Ellen Coolidge</persname>to her brother 
         <persname>Benjamin Randolph</persname>on February 6, 1861
         (copy made by 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>on December 3, 1897) mentions
         that the "idea of civil war makes all the blood in my body run
         cold." She understands the South's complaint, but says the
         Union is "too sacred" to be cast aside; and, that since the
         states of the upper South are not dominated by cotton, 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>and other border states will be
         out of place in a 
         <geogname>Confederate States of America</geogname>. 
         <persname>Ellen Coolidege</persname>claims to be a true
         Southern woman, but loves the Union and the stars and stripes
         "which are the only things around which all Americans can
         rally." There is a copy made by 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>on November 30, 1897 of a
         letter from July 13, [ ] written by 
         <persname>Ellen Coolidge</persname>to 
         <persname>Elizabeth Wormley</persname>, which shows that her
         affection for southern friends has been strengthened, and her
         fear of 
         <geogname>Boston</geogname>'s hatred of the South. She writes
         "I never approved of secession. But I am a daughter of the
         South," saying she wears the horrors of the (Civil) War like a
         penitent's iron belt. She avoids newspapers-- "those purveyors
         of falsehood, hatred, malice."</p>
      <p>MISCELLANEOUS</p>
      <p>The architectural drawings are chiefly undated. There is a
         drawing entitled the "Parlor floor at 
         <corpname>Monticello</corpname>, " copied from 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>'s original by [M. T. J.
         B.] on August 5, 1880. There are other drawings, including the
         plan of the original Jefferson house on 
         <corpname>Monticello</corpname>before additions. There is also
         a list of the ten 
         <persname>University of Virginia</persname>pavilions and the
         type of column of each and the classical source for each
         pavilion's styling. A drawing of the ancestral 
         <famname>Trist family</famname>home, " 
         <corpname>Tristford</corpname>, " in 
         <geogname>Devonshire, England</geogname>is also included.</p>
      <p>Material pertaining to the 
         <famname>Jefferson family</famname>and 
         <corpname>Monticello</corpname>consists of typed lists and
         transcripts. There is correspondence between 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>and 
         <persname>Joseph Cabell</persname>in 1816 on the subject of
         what flora makes the best live hedge. They discuss
         experiments, by a Mr. Maine, using Haws as hedges. A modern
         list of plants, and one flowers, which 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>had at 
         <corpname>Monticello</corpname>, is present. Also, there are
         copies of the inventory of the estate of 
         <persname>Peter Jefferson</persname>with an appraisal;
         although his book collection was small, there are some
         interesting volumes in it such as 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Trent's Astronomy</bibref>and 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">A Secret History of Queen Anne's Ministers</bibref>.
         The inventory and appraisal of the estate of 
         <persname>Jane Jefferson</persname>Jr., 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>'s sister, deals
         primarily with the apportionment of slaves. The last will and
         testament of 
         <persname>Jane Jefferson</persname>, 
         <persname>Peter Jefferson</persname>'s wife and 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>'s mother, deals
         primarily with this as well. There is also the last will and
         testament of 
         <persname>Peter Jefferson</persname>with the apportionment of
         his lands between his sons, 
         <persname>Randolph Jefferson</persname>and 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>, and the lands to be
         held jointly by them.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous folder material dates from 1816 to 1907, and
         n.d. There is a collection of riddles written by "grandmama
         Randolph and aunts," some written in French. Envelopes
         addressed to 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>at 
         <corpname>Monticello</corpname>are included with this
         collection. An unusual piece is a set of German maps: "Sachsen
         ( 
         <geogname>Lower Saxony</geogname>) and Palestina ( 
         <geogname>Palestine</geogname>in the time of Jesus)," with 
         <persname>"Browse Trist"</persname>and "Christmas 1845" on the
         cover. From 1856, there is a pamphlet from the 
         <corpname>Republican party</corpname>in support of their
         presidential candidate 
         <persname>John C. Fremont</persname>entitled "The `Sons of
         Liberty' in 1776, and in 1856." It maintains that the
         descendants of the colonial period "Sons of Liberty" ought to
         oppose the slave owners in the same manner as their noble
         forefathers opposed the British. Dated October 8, 1858 is a
         marriage certificate for 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson Trist</persname>and 
         <persname>Ellen Lyman</persname>signed by 
         <persname>Thomas Gallaudet</persname>, rector of 
         <corpname>St. Anne's</corpname>[ ] for deaf-mutes in 
         <geogname>New York</geogname>. On June 5, 1890, there is a
         list of resolutions adopted by the 
         <corpname>Pennsylvania Institute for Deaf and Dumb</corpname>,
         concerning the death of 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson Trist</persname>, who was a teacher
         at the Institute for thirty-five years. He is eulogized as "a
         faithful teacher, a man of high culture, intelligence,
         refinement and moral worth, and a true Christian, in his daily
         walk and deportment." There is also a copy of the inscription
         on the desk (identical to the one on which 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>wrote the Declaration) 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>gave to 
         <persname>Joseph Coolidge</persname>who married his
         granddaughter 
         <persname>Ellen Wayles Randolph</persname>: "Politics will
         give imaginary value to this relic for its association with
         the Declaration [of Independence]." There is also an undated
         note from 
         <persname>H. B. Trist</persname>, of 
         <geogname>Washington</geogname>which mentions President 
         <persname>Martin Van Buren</persname>'s and Colonel Burton's
         praise of 
         <persname>Nicholas P. Trist</persname>. There is also a
         description of the 
         <famname>Jefferson family</famname>and 
         <famname>Jefferies family</famname>coats-of-arms, and
         descriptions of 
         <famname>Trist family</famname>and related family
         coats-of-arms. There is also a lithograph of a blind beggar,
         with a French inscription underneath. There is an undated
         photocopy of 
         <famname>Nicholas P. Trist</famname>'s justification for his
         part in helping to formulate the treaty to end the Mexican
         War, which he says he did for the sake of his country and his
         family, not out of "noble ambition."</p>
      <p>The newspaper clippings date from 1863-1888, 1938, and n.d.
         Some of these concern 
         <persname>Nicholas P. Trist</persname>'s involvement with the
         treaty to end the Mexican War and later when Trist's deserved
         pension was held up partly due to bad feeling created by his
         action. Some of the clippings give historical and anecdotal
         information on the founding fathers. Other articles pertain to
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>'s descendents, and 
         <corpname>Monticello</corpname>, including pleas for the
         saving of the latter. There are also a number of Civil War
         pieces most which pertain to military action.</p>
      <p>BOUND VOLUMES</p>
      <p>The diary of 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>is in two volumes, dating
         (1878-1881) 1886 and 1885(1887-1889). There are numerous
         references to the deaths and funerals of family and friends.
         At the end of the first volume are genealogies of the 
         <famname>Burke family</famname>, with a description and
         drawing of the 
         <famname>Burke family</famname>coat-of-arms.</p>
      <p>The scrapbook kept by 
         <persname>Martha Burke</persname>is dated 1875 on its cover.
         The items in this include articles on politics, world events,
         the founding fathers, the "Trist Mission," and suggestions for
         moral living. A copy of the " 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Star-Spangled Banner</title>" with a couplet not sung
         today is included.</p>
      <p>There is also a autograph volume made as a tribute to 
         <persname>John Woolfolk Burke</persname>, one of the original
         trustees and directors of the 
         <corpname>Charlottesville Railroad</corpname>, on his death in
         1907.</p>
