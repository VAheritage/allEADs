      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of two letters, both containing
         material pertaining to slavery. The first letter, December 16,
         1843, from W.P. Goodwin, Rose Hill, Virginia, to James M.
         Beazley, asks for additional time to pay his account with
         Beazley for boarding his son Byrd [Goodwin] and lists the
         various items on his account. He credits his tardiness in
         payment to sickness in the family which forced him to depend
         too heavily on the management of his tobacco crop by his
         slaves who he claimed did not manage the crop properly
         resulting a loss of income and a short growing season for his
         wheat crop.</p>
      <p>In another letter, May 27, 1859, John B. Winfree, Woodlawn,
         Virginia, to his brother, Christopher V. Winfree, Lynchburg,
         discusses his plans for his "waitman and maid" apparently just
         inherited. He directs his brother to hire out the slave Peter,
         after providing him with summer clothes, and to send Cornelia
         home to help Annie as "I don't wish her to work in a factory."
         He also mentions other family news and looks forward to a
         visit from his brother and others.</p>
