      <p>Twin Oaks is a collective settlement established in 1967 in Louisa County, Virginia and inspired by B.F. Skinner's <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Walden Two.</title> The leadership of the Twin Oaks Community is a group of two or three members who serve on a board called Community Planners, the terms of which rotate after a designated period of time. Members write opinion and idea papers and post ideas on a community bulletin board in order to contribute their input regarding all of the decisions made by the community planners.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>
This collection consists of 11,073 items, 48 Hollinger boxes, and 240 linear feet and includes information about the councils, controversial issues, correspondence, and culture of the Twin Oaks Community in Louisa, Virginia from 1970-1989 and 1997. 
</p>
      <p>
Most of the papers are organized by councils composed of Twin Oaks members, including the Agriculture Council, Child Council, Construction and Utilities Council, Culinary Council, Domestic Council, Health Council, HEW Council, Income Council, Office Council, Outreach Council, Planning Council, Support Council, and Transportation and Maintenance Council.  These papers consist of meeting minutes, reports, planning notes, surveys, trade-off games, and budget priorities. 
</p>
      <p>
Areas of special interest include photographs of cows that live at Twin Oaks (under the Agriculture Council), opinion and idea papers that are written by members, planner's meeting minutes that reveal the inner workings of Twin Oaks and individual personalities and relationships of the members and planners. (Opinion and idea papers and planner's meeting minutes can be found under each council depending on the subject.)
</p>
      <p>
There is also information under the Income Council that describes the products and work that is marketed at Twin Oaks such as hammocks, tofu, indexing for the government and designs for numeric keyboards.
</p>
      <p>
The community has discussions regarding ratios of men to women in the community and a desire to create a more sincerely balanced society of men and women. The discussion is included under the Outreach Council.
</p>
      <p>
Another interesting item in the collection is the adoption of a South American refugee family into the Twin Oaks Community. More information about this can be found under the Support Council.
</p>
      <p>
Under the Planning Council and Legal Issues there is information about a member of Twin Oaks who is accused of armed robbery, grand larceny, felonious assault and use of a fire arm against a Charlottesville Jeweler, George Moody in 1980. Moody was later murdered in 1996 during an unrelated robbery. The papers include discussions encouraging members to give information to the police, debates about how to handle the remaining possessions of the member since he was expelled and legal advice regarding compensation for the items stolen.
</p>
      <p>
Also under the Planning Council and Legal Issues is a plan of prevention against the possible return of an ex-member who is feared to be violent.
</p>
      <p>
Other areas of interest are the controversial issues that arise in the community such as the issue of nudity around visitors and its impact on teenagers; noise; smoking; vandalism and other infractions. One notable incident is when the planners allow a senior citizen the special privilege of watching television when it is not allowed for other members and members are found in her room watching a program together and refuse to stop.  Another issue for members is that they have to earn quotas in hammock making while their other skills are being ignored. While members and planners struggle to work out these controversies, the papers show their strong desire to be a community that loves and respects its members.

      <head>Arrangement
</head>
      <p>This collection is divided into four series, the first of which is Councils and is arranged alphabetically by each council name. The second series consists of correspondence, including letters between members and visitors or members who are away, and is arranged alphabetically by topic. The third series concerns controversial issues that have developed at Twin Oaks and is also arranged alphabetically by topic. The fourth series is Culture, arranged alphabetically by topic, and includes artwork, books, children's activities, education, and food menus, as well as publications about Twin Oaks, spirituality, feminism, and values. There are opinion and idea papers for almost every topic that is pertinent to Twin Oaks, and they are included throughout this collection under the various subcategories organized by council.
