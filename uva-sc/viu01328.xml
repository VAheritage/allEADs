      <p>This collection consists of three items, 1862, chiefly two
         Civil War maps, "McClellan at Harrison's Landing," 1862, and
         "Potomac Border," depicting various sites in Virginia and
         Maryland. Both maps, drawn in ink on tracing paper, were
         discovered in a Rare Book Division bound volume of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Washington Intelligencer,</title>a
         Washington, D.C. newspaper, December 9 ("Potomac") &amp; 11
         ("McClellan"), 1856. Several other antebellum issues of the
         Intelligencer were previously owned by Jedediah Hotchkiss
         (1828-1899) ["J. Hotchkiss," Bridgewater, Rockingham County,
         and Mossy Creek, Augusta County, Virginia], a Confederate Army
         engineer and chief mapmaker for General Stonewall Jackson. The
         volumes later came into the possession of Charles William Kent
         (1860-1917), Linden Kent Memorial Professor of English
         Literature, 1893-1917, University of Virginia. 
         <lb/><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">The first map,</title><lb/>"McClellan at Harrison's Landing," measures 30 x 38
         centimeters and is on brown tracing paper in black ink with a
         two penciled sites. According to 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Hotchkiss Map
         Collection</title>(1977) it is perhaps a preliminary sketch of
         one prepared by Confederate Engineer Captain William Willis
         Blackford (1831- 1905): "Sketch of McCelland's [sic] position,
         July 7th, 1862" (reproduced in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Mapping the Civil War,</title>1992). It
         depicts several natural features and residences at Harrison's
         Landing, Charles City County, Virginia. There are some
         artistic similarities between this and the Blackford
         map.¹ Union General George B. McClellan's Army of
         the Potomac retreated here at the conclusion of the Peninsula
         Campaign on July 3, 1862 and remained until August 20, 1862.
         McClellan's army occupied an area from Herring Creek, the
         estates of Westover [Harrison's Landing] and Berkeley (not
         shown on map) to Kimages' Landing, with the James River,
         patrolled by Union gunboats as depicted on the map,
         safeguarding its flanks and rear.² This Confederate
         military reconnaissance map includes an area labeled "Enimies
         Pos" [Enemies' Position] of Union defensive works consisting
         of batteries and abatis. Adjacent to this is an area labeled
         "Obstructions on Road." The headquarters of three Confederate
         generals, A(mbrose) P(owell) Hill (1825-1865), Thomas J.
         "Stonewall" Jackson (1824-1863) and Robert E. Lee (1807-1870)
         are also shown. During the campaign Blackford was under the
         command of Confederate Brigadier General Jeb Stuart
         (1833-1864) who launched an unsuccessful attack on Union
         forces from Evelington Hills on July 3, 1862. Various
         topographical and natural features (hills, creeks and woods)
         include: East Branch/Run [of Herring's Creek], Herring Creek,
         and West Run [of Herring's Creek]. Other prominent features
         are Bradley's Store, Carter's Mill, East Berry, Evelington
         Hills [Evelington Heights], a ferry, Kimmages' [Kimages']
         Landing, the direction to Charles City Court House [Charles
         City], River Road [James River Road], Roland's Mill [Roland's
         Mill Pond], Staggs Road, Turkey Island [Turkey Island Creek
         Bridge], Westover Church, West Berry and West Branch/Run [of
         Herring's Creek]. Incorrect positions of [the mouth of] the
         Appomattox River and City Point (both should be farther west),
         also "Shirly," are marked out in pencil. Residents and
         residences include: D. Adams, L. Adams, J. Barlow [pencil],
         Bcornet? [Barnett], Charity, Clark, Clarke, Dr. Crenshaw,
         Crenshaw, Dority, John Harrison, Ackerman, Miles, Pearman (two
         residences), [Edward] Philips, Pollard, Roach, Shirly
         [Shirley; an incorrect position is marked through in pencil],
         Stagg, Talman's, Upshers [pencil; Dr. Upshaw], Westover
         [McClellan's headquarters] and Col. Wilcox. This map's
         approximate cardinal points are north (Gen. Lee's
         headquarters), south (James River), east (Col. Wilcox) and
         west (Shirley). 
         <lb/><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">The second map,</title><lb/>"Potomac Border," ca. 1862, is on brown tracing paper
         and measures 37 x 52 centimeters. It is possibly an unfinished
         copy of "Map of Loudoun County, Va., and parts of Fairfax
         County, Va., Jefferson County, W. Va., and Washington and
         Frederick Counties Md."³ It depicts natural and
         manmade features of Virginia [Fairfax and Loudoun counties]
         and Maryland [Frederick, Howard, Montgomery and Prince Georges
         counties]; roads are shown in red, railroads and towns in
         black and elevations by brown hachures. Among the displayed
         natural features are: Ball's Bluff, Big Patuxent River, Blue
         Ridge Mountains, Catoctin Mountains, Difficult Creek, Goose
         Creek, Monocacy River, Potomac River, Seneca Creek, Shenandoah
         River, Short Hills, Snicker's Gap and Sugarloaf [Sugar Loaf]
         Mountain. Included towns, cities and villages are Alexandria,
         Annapolis Junction, Bailey's X Roads [Baileys Crossroads],
         Beltsville, Berlin, Bladensburg, Dranesville, Ellicott's Mills
         [Ellicott City], Falls Church, Flint Hill, Frederick City
         [Frederick], Georgetown, Great Falls, Harpers Ferry,
         Highsville, Hillsborough [Hillsboro] Laurel, Leesburg,
         Lovettsville, Monocacy, Mt. Airy, Mt. Gilead, Oatland Mills,
         Point of Rocks, Purcellville, Rockville, Seneca Mills,
         Snickersville, Tennallytown, Vienna, Washington, Waterford and
         Wheatland. Military sites include Chain Bridge, Fort Lincoln,
         Fort Pennsylvania (Fort Reno as of late 1862), two batteries
         and three signal stations; other interesting details include
         the locations of several private residences, the National
         Road, unidentified railroads, and distances to and from
         various towns to Alexandria and Washington. This map's
         approximate cardinal points are north (National Road), south
         (Flint Hill), east (Washington) and west (Blue Ridge
         Mountains). A paper hand tracing accompanies this "Potomac"
         map.</p>
