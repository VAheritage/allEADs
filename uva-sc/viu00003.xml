         <p> Angelica Schuyler Churchwas the daughter of General Philip John
            Schuyler, a Major General in the Continental Army and a member of
            the Continental Congress. He later served as one of the first two
            United StatesSenators from New York. Angelica Schuylermarried John
            Barker Church, a British businessman, who was George Washington's
            Commissary General during the Revolution and later became a member
            of the English Parliament. Church had fled Englandafter a duel and
            later, using the name John Carter, eloped with Angelica Schuylerand
            became a successful entrepreneur. Mrs. Church traveled in social
            circles which included the most prominent figures of her time. In
            Paris, she was introduced to Thomas Jeffersonby her close friend
            Maria Cosway; Church's daughter Catharine ("Kitty") Churchwas a
            playmate of Jefferson's daughter, Mary ("Polly") Jefferson. These
            social connections made her instrumental in the release of Lafayette
            from the prison at Olmutz, Austria. Mrs. Church's sister, Elizabeth
            Schuyler, married Alexander Hamilton.</p>
         <p>The Church archive contains correspondence from the period of the
            founding of America, including letters from two of the Founding
            Fathers, Alexander Hamiltonand Thomas Jefferson, whose personal and
            political differences helped shape the course of political dialogue
            in the early days of the country. The letters are rich in personal
            and historical detail. Both Hamilton and Jefferson write to Mrs.
            Church with a combination of intimacy and respect. These letters
            complement the recorded history of the private lives of two of the
            most prominent statesment in the early years of independence, and
            provides evidence of their practical concerns. There are other
            letters from Jefferson to Church held in the Library of
            Congress.</p>
         <p>Following the biographical notes is an annotated listing of each
            letter and document. The majority of the correspondence has been
            described; letters written in French or other foreign language have
            not been described.</p>

                     time the support by the Jeffersonian Antifederalist for the

                     minority here...It is gaining strength---Your countrymen
                     are zealous but they are not mad." During that time there
                     had also been an official inquiry into the condition of the
                     Treasury, and an subsequent call on February 28 censuring
                     Hamilton did not pass; Hamilton comments, "Our own Jacobins
                     have made a violent effort against me, but a complete
                     victory has been gained to their utter confusion."</p>

                  <p>Relates his feelings toward her, writing that he is "bound
                     by such sentiments of affection and gratitude." Reveals the
                     present situation of his family, mentioning his wife's
                     illness; his daughter Anastasia and her husband Charles
                     Latour Maubourg giving him two granddaughters, one of whom
                     they lost; and, possibly being able to embark for America
                     with George [his son George Washington de Lafayette].
                     Refers to his own political and personal concerns,
                     particularly in reference to his [former] fellow prisoner
                     Bureau Puzy who is planning to settle his family in

                     to France; his intelligence from Paris gives him good
