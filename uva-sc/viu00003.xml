        imprisonment, and the War of 1812; travel in Polandand Austriaand in England; trade in

      <p> Angelica Schuyler Churchwas the daughter of General Philip John Schuyler, a Major General
        in the Continental Army and a member of the Continental Congress. He later served as one of
        the first two United StatesSenators from New York. Angelica Schuylermarried John Barker
        Church, a British businessman, who was George Washington's Commissary General during the
        Revolution and later became a member of the English Parliament. Church had fled Englandafter
        a duel and later, using the name John Carter, eloped with Angelica Schuylerand became a
        successful entrepreneur. Mrs. Church traveled in social circles which included the most
        prominent figures of her time. In Paris, she was introduced to Thomas Jeffersonby her close
        friend Maria Cosway; Church's daughter Catharine ("Kitty") Churchwas a playmate of
        Jefferson's daughter, Mary ("Polly") Jefferson. These social connections made her
        instrumental in the release of Lafayette from the prison at Olmutz, Austria. Mrs. Church's
        sister, Elizabeth Schuyler, married Alexander Hamilton.</p>
      <p>The Church archive contains correspondence from the period of the founding of America,
        including letters from two of the Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamiltonand Thomas Jefferson,
        whose personal and political differences helped shape the course of political dialogue in
        the early days of the country. The letters are rich in personal and historical detail. Both
        Hamilton and Jefferson write to Mrs. Church with a combination of intimacy and respect.
        These letters complement the recorded history of the private lives of two of the most
        prominent statesment in the early years of independence, and provides evidence of their
        practical concerns. There are other letters from Jefferson to Church held in the Library of
        Congress.</p>
      <p>Following the biographical notes is an annotated listing of each letter and document. The
        majority of the correspondence has been described; letters written in French or other
        foreign language have not been described.</p>

              there had also been an official inquiry into the condition of the Treasury, and an
              subsequent call on February 28 censuring Hamilton did not pass; Hamilton comments,

              been gained to their utter confusion."</p>
