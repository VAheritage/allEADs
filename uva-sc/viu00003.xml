            Jefferson(1743-1826); Marquis de Lafayette(1757-1834); Abraham

            Steuben(1730-1794); Charles Maurice de
            Talleyrand-Perigord(1754-1838); and, George
            Washington(1732-1799).</p>
      <p>Topics of interest include national politics and foreign affairs
            including the politics of Alexander Hamiltonand Thomas Jefferson,
            the French Revolution, Marquis de Lafayetteand his imprisonment, and
            the War of 1812; travel in Polandand Austriaand in England; trade in
            Americaand India; and, family and personal matters. Persons
            mentioned or discussed include Marquis de Lafayetteand his family,
            Marquis de La Tour(1770-1853); Philip John Schuyler; John
            Trumbull(1756-1843), Maria Cosway, Mary Jefferson Eppes[Mrs. John
            Wayles Eppes] (1778-1804), Martha Jefferson Randolph[Mrs. Thomas
            Mann Randolph] (1772-1808), and Madam de Corny.</p>
      <p> Angelica Schuyler Churchwas the daughter of General Philip John
            Schuyler, a Major General in the Continental Army and a member of
            the Continental Congress. He later served as one of the first two
            United StatesSenators from New York. Angelica Schuylermarried John
            Barker Church, a British businessman, who was George Washington's
            Commissary General during the Revolution and later became a member
            of the English Parliament. Church had fled Englandafter a duel and
            later, using the name John Carter, eloped with Angelica Schuylerand
            became a successful entrepreneur. Mrs. Church traveled in social
            circles which included the most prominent figures of her time. In
            Paris, she was introduced to Thomas Jeffersonby her close friend
            Maria Cosway; Church's daughter Catharine ("Kitty") Churchwas a
            playmate of Jefferson's daughter, Mary ("Polly") Jefferson. These
            social connections made her instrumental in the release of Lafayette
            from the prison at Olmutz, Austria. Mrs. Church's sister, Elizabeth
            Schuyler, married Alexander Hamilton.</p>
      <p>The Church archive contains correspondence from the period of the
            founding of America, including letters from two of the Founding
            Fathers, Alexander Hamiltonand Thomas Jefferson, whose personal and
            political differences helped shape the course of political dialogue
            in the early days of the country. The letters are rich in personal
            and historical detail. Both Hamilton and Jefferson write to Mrs.
            Church with a combination of intimacy and respect. These letters
            complement the recorded history of the private lives of two of the
            most prominent statesment in the early years of independence, and
            provides evidence of their practical concerns. There are other
            letters from Jefferson to Church held in the Library of
            Congress.</p>
      <p>Following the biographical notes is an annotated listing of each
            letter and document. The majority of the correspondence has been
            described; letters written in French or other foreign language have
            not been described.</p>

                     Treasury, and an subsequent call on February 28 censuring
                     Hamilton did not pass; Hamilton comments, "Our own Jacobins
                     have made a violent effort against me, but a complete
                     victory has been gained to their utter confusion."</p>

            <p>Relates his feelings toward her, writing that he is "bound
                     by such sentiments of affection and gratitude." Reveals the
                     present situation of his family, mentioning his wife's
                     illness; his daughter Anastasia and her husband Charles
                     Latour Maubourg giving him two granddaughters, one of whom
                     they lost; and, possibly being able to embark for America
                     with George [his son George Washington de Lafayette].
                     Refers to his own political and personal concerns,
                     particularly in reference to his [former] fellow prisoner
