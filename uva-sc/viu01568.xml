      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a four page letter from Lt.
         Edward Davis Townsend (1817-1893), Fort New Smyrna, Florida,
         to his mother, Eliza Gerry Townsend, wife of Major David S.
         Townsend, U.S. Army, Boston, Massachusetts, December 21, 1837,
         written while a lieutenant in the Second Seminole War
         campaign.</p>
      <p>Townsend describes his work in surveying and laying out the
         city of New Smyrna as a favor for Major Lytle, one of the
         owners of the New Smyrna property. He also furnishes many
         details concerning several of the more well-known Indian
         leaders of the Seminoles during the Second Seminole War when
         the Indians began to resist the plan of the United States
         Government to remove the tribe further to the West. Another
         company of the Second Artillery was to soon join them at Fort
         Smyrna to help drive the estimated one thousand remaining
         Indians into the swampy area near the St. Johns River where
         they could be dispersed or forced to surrender.</p>
      <p>He also mentions the escape of Coacoochee from Fort Marion
         at St. Augustine where he was imprisoned with Seminole leader
         Powell, also known as Osceola, (1800-1838). Townsend credits
         Coacoochee with convincing Indian chief Sam Jones to refuse to
         surrender and to continue to harass United States troops. He
         also highly praises the character and ability of Osceola, the
         most well-known Seminole leader of resistance, and furnishes a
         second-hand description of the Battle of Withelacoochee
         between Osceola and Captain [Gustavus S.?] Drane. He expresses
         his pity for the Indians imprisoned at Fort Marion in St.
         Augustine, who were dying two or three a day due to the
         unhealthy conditions of the fort.</p>
