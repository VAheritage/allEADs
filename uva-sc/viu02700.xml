      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>James Barbour (1775-1842) of Orange County, Virginia, was
         the son of Col. Thomas Barbour, who served in the House of
         Burgesses and on the committee of Safety during the
         Revolutionary War. James Barbour was a member of the General
         Assembly (1796-1812) until he became governor in 1812, serving
         during the tumultuous years of the War of 1812. Following the
         war, he was elected to the United States Senate and served
         from 1815-1825; he served as Secretary of War under President
         John Quincy Adams, 1825-1829. In 1829, he returned to his life
         as a Virginia planter, residing in "Barboursville."</p>
      <p>His son, Benjamin Johnson Barbour (1821-1894), attended the
         University of Virginia from 1837-1839. After the conclusion of
         the Civil War, Barbour was appointed by Governor Pierpoint to
         the new Board of Visitors (1865-1873). He served as Rector
         from 1866 until 1872.</p>
      <p>Barbour belonged to the old Whig party of Virginia and was
         the orator at the unveiling of the Henry Clay statue in
         Capitol Square, Richmond, in 1858. It was said that he never
         approved of the secession of Virginia from the Union But after
         the beginning of hostilities at Ft. Sumter, he suggested that
         a subscription be made for the defense of the state. In 1865
         he was elected to Congress but was not seated. He did serve in
         the House of Delegates from 1879 to 1880. Barbour also served
         as a visitor to the Miller School in Albermarle County, was
         prominent in the State Agriculture Society, and was president
         of the University of Virginia Alumni Society.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection chiefly consists of the personal and
         financial papers of James Barbour (1775-1842) of
         "Barboursville," Orange County, Virginia, and his descendants.
         The collection contains financial and legal papers, printed
         material, correspondence, scrapbooks, plats, manuscripts,
         commonplace books, genealogical information, drawings, ballot
         sheets, Union Army general orders from the Civil War, and
         slave inventories.</p>
      <p>The correspondence and financial papers of James Barbour,
         his son, Benjamin Johnson Barbour (1821-1894), and his
         granddaughter, Caroline Homassel Barbour Ellis (1861- ) form
         the bulk of the collection. The collection does not contain
         any official papers from James Barbour's service in the U. S.
         Senate, in the national government, or as governor of
         Virginia. The papers of Benjamin Johnson Barbour contain much
         correspondence from his association with the University of
         Virginia as a member of the Board of Visitors and Rector. The
         letters of most of the correspondents, whose names are listed
         later in this guide, can be found in his personal
         correspondence.</p>
      <p>Topics of interest in the letters include: James Barbour's
         complaints concerning his son James' extravagance while
         attending Harvard, and references to hardships during the War

         B. J. Barbour and other conservatives to support the
