      <p>Davis was born on April 18, 1864, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Lemuel Clarke
                Davis, a newspaper editor, and prominent novelist, Rebecca Harding Davis. He made
                his reputation as a newspaper reporter in May to June 1889, by reporting on the
                devastation of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, following the disaster of the flood. Davis
                became a managing editor of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Harper's Weekly</title>, and was
                one of the world's leading war correspondents at the time of the Second Boer War in
                South Africa. As an American, he had the unique opportunity to see the war
                first-hand from both the British and Boer sides. Davis also worked as a reporter for
                the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New York Herald, The Times</title>, and 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Scribner's Magazine</title>. He was married twice, first to
                Cecil Clark Lewis, an artist, in Marion, Massachusetts, on May 4, 1899, and then to
                Bessie McCoy, a Vaudeville star. He and Bessie had a daughter, Hope. Davis died of a
                heart attack at home on April 11, 1916 at fifty-one years of age. Several books were
                consulted for information concerning Davis and his trip to South Africa, including
                    <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Richard Harding David Years</title> by Gerald
                Langford, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Reporter Who Would Be King</title> by Arthur

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection contains Richard Harding Davis Letters concerning South Africa and
                the Boer War. Letters and documents by Richard Harding Davis and his wife Cecil
                describe their voyages to and from South Africa, the cities of Cape Town and
                Pretoria, and his coverage of the Boer War from both the British and the Boer sides.
                There are references to General Buller, Winston Churchill, Lady Randolph Churchill,
                Christiaan de Wet, Rudyard Kipling, Paul Kruger, Sir Alfred Milner, Lord Frederick
                Roberts, Allen Sangree, President M. T. Steyn, and Sir George Stuart White. Of great
                interest are letters describing the relief of Ladysmith, March 3-4, 1900, and the
                fall of Pretoria, May 18, 1900. A photograph of Cecil in a rickshaw in Durban is
                included as is a magazine of their return ship the R. P. D. 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">König</title> of the Deutsche Ost-Afrika-Linie.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement>
      <p>These letters were formerly mounted into a scrapbook and numbered consecutively with
                a penciled notation at the top of the letter. The letters have been removed from the
                scrapbook for preservation purposes. The collection is now arranged by the date of
                the letter, or if undated, by the contents of the letter, and not the original order
                as arranged in the scrapbook, presumably that of the date of receipt.</p>
      <p>Item number 10 is actually two separate letters on two consecutive days, so it has
                been foldered separately. Several numbers, 25, 28, 30, and 32, are missing and those
                items are presumed lost or mis-numbered by the recipient or the creator of the
                scrapbook. There are also two items numbered 33. When it can be determined, the
                entire name of the correspondent is used in the listing, even if the letter has only
                the first name or a nickname. This is indicated by the use of brackets.</p>

                            Canada, and used it to ferry sixty frozen bodies over it in buckets at
                            one time; their ship is halfway across to Great Britain; they also had
                            tea with the Cass Canfield couple and talked politics at dinnertime. The
                            Klondike man claims he is a great leader in the Democratic party and
                            predicts they will toss out Bryan at the Convention at the last minute
                            and nominate Dewey or Olney with Wheeler as vice president. He assures
                            them that this is the strategy of Whitney and Josiah Quincy.</unittitle>

                            soldiers, who form quite a contrast with the poor conditions of health
                            of the garrison, "They are yellow with fever, their teeth protruding and
                            the skin drawn tight over their skeletons - the incoming army had had
                            fourteen days hard fighting at the end of three months campaigning and
                            were robust and tanned ragged and caked with mud. As they came in they
                            cheered and the garrison tried to cheer back but it was like a whisper -
                            Winston Churchill and I stood in front of General [Sir George] White and
                            cried for an hour." Davis also mentions the heavy losses among the men
                            trying to break the siege, the scarcity of food, his ration of four
                            biscuits, an ounce of coffee and of tea, along with something called

          <p>Ladysmith, March 4, has received the first letter from her since they
                            left home, complains about how the British have fought the war, "It is a
                            beastly dull war - the whole thing is so 'class', and full of 'form' and
                            tradition and worrying over 'putties' and etiquette and rank - It is the
                            most wonderful organization I ever imagined but it is like a beautiful
                            locomotive without an engineer - the Boers out play them in intelligence
                            every day - the whole army is officered by one class and that the dull
                            one - It is like the House of Peers - You would not believe the mistakes
                            they make, the awful way in which they sacrifice the lives of officers
                            and men." Both portions,</p>

                            then Winburg, and finally Smaaldel, all of which were taken by the
                            British before they could reach the area; yesterday they rode out with
                            [Otto von Lossberg] and camped at a Boer farm, just behind the Boer
                            trenches on the Sand River, with the British six miles away; Cecil
                            created a sensation among the Boers since all the women had fled; they
                            met President [Marthinus] Steyn, who gave Cecil a flower from his coat
                            and talked with her for some time; they decided to spend the night at
                            [Jones's Hotel], Ventersberg and Cecil woke him to say the British were
                            at the railway station, two hour's ride away but they have not arrived
                            yet; and they are now free to travel wherever they want through the loan
                            of [Otto von Lossberg]'s cart with two seats and five mules,</unittitle>

                            until the present; writes about Captain [Otto von Lossberg], "a German
                            baron who married in New Orleans and became an American citizen and who
                            is now in command of Lossberg's Artillery in the Free State"; describes
                            in greater detail their meeting with President Steyn and the letter he
                            gave them to Dr. Reid, who ran an ambulance base on [Piet] Cronje's
                            farm, instructing him to give Cecil something to sleep on; they returned
                            to Ventersberg that night only to overhear an alarm about the closeness
                            of the British given to the landlady, "a grand low comedy character from
                            Brooklyn … sitting up in bed in curl papers, and with a Webley
                            revolver"; having decided to go back to sleep, they were able to use
                            Lossberg's cape cart and five mules to pack their things and head to the
                            Sand River, spending the night at Cronje's farm where Dr. Reid gave
                            Cecil his field mattress; they then used Lossberg's cart to pursue their
                            next objective - to reach the railroad bridge over the Sand River; they
                            found themselves between the Boer and British lines and stopped for
                            lunch; about three o'clock they were captured by three Boers, "I was
                            riding behind the cart and threw up my hands 'that quick,' but Cecil
                            could not hear me yelling at her to stop on account of the noise of the
                            cart - I knew if I rode after her they would shoot at me, and that if
                            she did not stop, as they were shouting at her to do, they would shoot
                            her. Under these trying circumstances I sat still - It caused quite a
                            coolness on Cecil's part."; they were finally released by the three
                            Boers and next met General Christiaan De Wet (1854–1922), who
                            directed them to a farmhouse about five miles off where they could
                            safely see the fighting the next day, although they decided to camp out
                            on the veldt near a stream; they were awakened by the sound of
                            bombardment and hurriedly tried to get out of the danger area, Cecil
                            showing much self-possession and calm and even urging the Boers to make
                            a stand; when the British were within five hundred yards of the Boer
                            artillery and [Louis?] Botha's men made a break for it, Richard finally
                            convinced Cecil to get on her pony and race for Ventersberg; when they
                            arrived there, they found everyone harnessing up [their carts and
                            wagons] and abandoning everything; Cecil determined to loot the cook
                            from Jones Hotel to work for them in Pretoria; while helping her pack
                            her things and anything else useful, the message came that the British
                            were only fifteen minutes away, so Richard loaded the cook, Cecil,
                            supplies, a dog and a kitten, in the cart, mounted his horse and left
                            hurriedly for Kroonstad racing for thirty miles in five hours without
                            one stop; at Kroonstad, President Steyn ordered a special car for
                            Richard and Cecil and sent them off at once; they plan to return as soon
                            as Davis reaches the Vaal where there must be a stand; the cook proves
                            to be a treasure and Cecil is busy doing portraits in oil,</unittitle>
