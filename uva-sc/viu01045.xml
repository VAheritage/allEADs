        <p>The sons of Harry F. Byrd--Harry F. Byrd, Jr., Richard E. Byrd, and Beverley B. Byrd--presented their father's papers to the University of Virginia in March 1971. Papers relating to Byrd's Senate career were picked up on March 2 from the Victory Van Corporation, Alexandria, Virginia where they had been stored since 1965. Eight days later a second group which dealt with the years 1911-1932, was collected from the Senator's home, Rosemont.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Harry Flood Byrd, Sr. Papers, 1911-1965,
         consist of 273 linear feet of correspondence, memoranda,
         records, files of all sorts, photographs, scrapbooks, etc.
         pertaining largely to the 
         Virginia Senator's political and business
         careers. Save for his years as governor of 
         Virginia (1925-1929) the collection
         documents in great detail his activities in politics and
         business. The bulk of the political papers deal with 
         Virginiastate politics, and present a
         clear picture of Byrd's leadership of the state Democratic
         Party. Substantive material from or concerning national
         figures for the period is not to be found in these papers.</p>
      <p>Material of greatest research value is probably to be found
         in the papers before 1932 when Byrd was elected to the U.S.
         Senate. The correspondence files are particularly rich and
         helpful in the 1920's. A cautiousness of statement appears in
         his correspondence when Byrd arrives in Washington, but the
         tendency disappears after a few years, and the later
         correspondence is candid and useful.</p>
      <p>The papers of Senator Byrd are invaluable for any study of
         Virginia's politics and public life during Byrd's lifetime.
         Because of his great success as an apple grower and farmer,
         researchers in these fields will find much of value here.
         There is also some material useful for the study of
         journalistic history, and other fields of research.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement>
      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The collection arrived at the University of Virginia
         divided into business, personal, and political groups. There
         was a great deal of inconsistency and repetition within and
         between the three divisions. As a result, it was decided that
         a thorough reorganization was in order. Five series were
         evolved which are described below.</p>
      <p>The arrangement is chronological and varies from series to
         series. Within each chronology generally topics and
         correspondents are alphabetized together. Individual folders
         were made when a person was a voluminous correspondent or was
         politically prominent. Topics always have separate folders and
         will be specifically mentioned in the guide. The researcher
         must be willing to search topical files for information on
         specific people. For example, there could be Watt Abbitt
         correspondence in the Alfalfa Club, the Luncheons, and the
         Senate Campaign of 1964 folders.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series I: Business, 1914-1965: </emph>
Correspondence, memoranda, bills, and receipts comprise
            this Series. Senator Byrd's various business interests are
            represented--apple and peach growing, general farming, cold
            storage, and newspaper publishing. In the pre-1932 years,
            those papers detail exhaustively Senator Byrd's financial
            career, especially in the apple business.</p>
      <p>There are three subsections to Series I. First, a
            general business section arranged chronologically and
            within the year alphabetically by correspondent and topic.
            There follows a section on the apple sales of specific
            orchards-- Rosemont, 
            Turkey Knob, and 
            Timberville. Thirdly, a section on
            general apple sales is arranged chronologically.</p>
      <p>The general business material was pulled in many cases
            from storage boxes marked personal and political from both
            shipments of material. The files on the apple sales came
            chiefly from the attic of 
            Rosemont. They are chiefly bills and
            receipts, and orders for apples.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series II: Political, 1911-1932: </emph>
This series documents Senator Byrd's rise to political
            prominence and gives a detailed picture of the formation
            and maintenance of the Byrd Organization. But it must be
            repeated that there is a gap for the gubernatorial years.
            We assume material for this part of his official life is to
            be found in the Executive Papers of the Library of
            Virginia.</p>
      <p>The chronology for Series II is by one year periods,
            and, of course, alphabetically by topic and correspondent
            within those time spans.</p>
      <p>This material had been stored at Rosemont, and
            practically every piece was rearranged.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series III: Political, 1933-1965: </emph>
Series III contains material on Byrd's senatorial
            career. Although there is correspondence with national
            political figures, both qualitatively and quantitatively,
            the materials deal with Virginia politics and government
            rather than national politics and government.</p>
      <p>Chronological arrangements for this series is by four
            year subsections, save for the last which is a 5 year
            period (1933-1936; 1937-1940; 1945-1948; 1949-1952;
            1953-1956; 1941-1944; 1957-1960; 1961-1965). Within these
            sub-series, material is again alphabetically by
            correspondent and topic.</p>
      <p>These papers came to the University from the Victory Van
            Storage Company. They had evidently been boxed in the
            Senator's Washington office after his death. As with Series
            II, it was necessary to go through nearly every folder to
            assure consistency.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series IV: Miscellaneous topics: </emph>
Divided into 8 sub-series, this section contains
            material which would not easily fit into the first three
            series or were simply too large to be integrated.</p>
      <p>A. Appointment &amp; engagement books, 1928-29 &amp;
            1950-1965</p>
      <p>B. Magazine articles, 1920-1966. This sub-series is
            comprised of articles by and about Byrd, and some collected
            by him. There are some drafts and correspondence re the
            articles, and their publication. The arrangement is
            chronological.</p>
      <p>C. Newsclippings, 1924-1966. A miscellaneous collection
            dealing with a wide range of topics-- 
            Harry F. Byrd, 
            Virginia politics, economic, issues,
            etc. The arrangement is chronological.</p>
      <p>D. Constituents' mail, 1957, 1960-1965. Comprised of
            letters to Byrd from his "national" constituency,
            commending, and, in some instances, condemning Byrd's
            position on various issues. In addition, this sub- series
            contains three bound volumes of letters, 1963 April-May,
            from various chapters of the 
            Virginia Chamber of Commerce.</p>
      <p>E. 
            Harry F. ByrdVoting Record, 1933-1965.
            Consists of seven bound volumes and five boxes of material
            detailing the Senator's voting record for 1933-1943 and
            1953-1965. However, in 1957 the first session of the 85th
            Congress is not represented.</p>
      <p>F. Speeches and Statements. This sub-series is divided
            into several sections. Byrd kept a "Reference file of other
            people's speeches." This is arranged alphabetically and is
            indexed. There is also another alphabet of other people's
            speeches which was pulled together from various locations,
            and is listed item by item. Secondly, there is a large file
            of Byrd's speeches, 1920-1965, arranged chronologically,
            which contains many original drafts with holograph
            corrections, and mimeograph copies. Thirdly, is a section
            of Public Statements, 1922-1965, which includes press
            releases.</p>
      <p>G. Scrapbooks, 1906-1965. Consists of 110 loose volumes
            and two boxes. The first two volumes in this sub-series are
            scrapbooks of 
            Richard E. Byrd, Sr.The remaining
            items contain newspapers, photographs and some
            correspondence pertinent to 
            Harry Byrd's career.</p>
      <p>H. Cartoon Collection, Photographs and Awards.
            Throughout his political life, Byrd collected cartoons
            about himself. They lined the walls of his Senate office.
            There is a card index to these 575 framed drawings and a
            microfilm has been prepared of each for reference use. This
            sub-series also contains photographs of political figures
            and friends, and various awards and certificates presented
            to the Senator.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series V: Byrd and Flood Families: </emph>
This series contains papers relating to Richard Evelyn Byrd, Sr. and Jr., Harry F. Byrd, Jr., Hal D. Flood, Joel W. Floodand various other Byrds and Floods. It is divided into 5 sub-series.</p>
      <p>A. 
            Richard E. Byrd, Sr., father of the
            Senator and prominent member of the Virginia House of
            Delegates. His papers, 1907-1928, contain political and
            legal correspondence with Harry F. Byrd and others. The
            arrangement is generally chronological with some topical
            breakdown.</p>
      <p>B. 
            Richard E. Byrd, Jr., U. S. Navy
            Admiral and polar explorer. Papers, 1917-1957, consist
            chiefly of correspondence between the Admiral and the
            Senator--many of a political nature--and letters from the
            Senator concerning his brother. There is material relating
            to the death of Admiral Byrd and the creation of various
            memorials to him.</p>
      <p>C. 
            Harry Flood Byrd, Jr.: The
            correspondence of Byrd, Jr. with Byrd, Sr. has been pulled
            together from various locations and placed in this
            sub-series. In addition, there is material concerning
            legislation the younger Byrd proposed, and comments by him
            on the Civil Rights Act of 1965.</p>
      <p>D. Various members of the Byrd Family. Chiefly correspondence,
            1917-1965, of Senator Byrd with various members of the
            family, and with non-relatives concerning Byrd genealogy.
            There is a segment of condolence letters, 1957, to the
            Senator on the death of his mother, 
            Eleanor Bolling (Flood) Byrd. Letters
            from prominent people have been pulled from this subseries
            and placed in Series III.</p>
      <p>E. 
            Flood Family. This sub-series is
            composed of 2 sections. First is a topical arrangement of 
            Hal D. Floodpapers, 1896-1922. There
            is some political correspondence, although the Library of
            Congress holds the more important pieces of Flood's papers.
            In addition, there is business &amp; legal correspondence,
            and material relating to the settlements of various
            estates. Of note are the 
            Thomas S. Martinestate and that of 
            Hal Floodhimself.</p>
      <p>The second section chiefly contains the estates of other
            members of the 
            Flood family: 
            Joel W. Flood, 
            Anna Portner Flood, 
            Bolling Byrd Flood, and 
            Eleanor F. Flood, 
            Hal Flood, 
            Richard E. Byrd, Sr., and 
            Harry F. Byrd, Sr.were all executors
            or guardians to these Floods and their papers are found in
            the group.</p>
