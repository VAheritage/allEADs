      <p>Samuel K. Jackson earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from
         Columbia College, New York, a Master of Arts degree from
         Washington College, Connecticut, and a Doctor of Medicine
         degree from Washington University, Baltimore, Maryland. He
         moved to Norfolk from Leesburg after the death of his brother
         in 1855 to assist in efforts to combat an outbreak of yellow
         fever. He became a member of Norfolk's Board of Health, ca.
         1866-1870's, and was later president of the Medical Society of
         Virginia during 1885 and a professor of Applied Chemistry at
         the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Virginia (now
         Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University).

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>These papers, ca. 125 items (one Hollinger box), 1855,
         1858, 1866 &amp; 1872-1893, are concerned with the activities
         of Dr. Samuel K. Jackson (1817-1899), a Norfolk, Virginia,
         physician. Also present are sermons, 1826-1844, of his
         brother, Reverend William L. Jackson (?--1855), a Norfolk
         clergyman.</p>
      <p>Dr. Jackson's papers include lectures, speeches, articles,
         reports, correspondence, class notes, newspapers clippings,
         and miscellaneous items. Subjects discussed in the lectures
         include digestion, tuberculosis, cholera, tuberculin, typhoid
         fever, alcohol, light, physical education and purification of
         Norfolk's water supply as well as reports and addresses
         regarding his professional activities and interests.</p>
      <p>His correspondence examines such topics as methods for the
         prevention and control of cholera, the use of prisoners to
         cleanse the city, and the temporary "thinning out" of freedmen
         from their crowded quarters as part of those efforts, 1866; 
         <emph render="super">1</emph>there is an 1879 letter from
         Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman pertaining to the
         disinfection of vessels and their cargoes, and an 1893 letter
         pertaining to his friend and colleague Dr. David Minton Wright
         [1809-1863] who was hanged for the murder of an Union officer
         during the Civil War (February 17, 1893). 
         <emph render="super">2</emph>In addition, there are several
         letters, some of which are newspaper clippings, 1879-1881,
         chiefly from Norfolk newspapers such as the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Landmark</title>, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Weekly Herald</title>, and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Publick Ledger</title>, between Jackson
         and James Barron Hope, editor of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Landmark</title>. These letters
         appertain to whom should receive credit for the Board of
         Health's control of cholera outbreaks in Norfolk (Jackson
         denies it should be given to a Dr. Ward or Captain John Sims),
         August 6 &amp; 23, 1886; and his dispute with Nathan Burnham
         Webster as to the city mortality rates. Other correspondents
         and individuals mentioned are P. W. Stanhope, Dr. A. T. Bell,
         John Gangee, and Dr. J. H. Van [Eman?] of Kansas City,
         Missouri.</p>
      <p>There are three items regarding Jackson's association with
         the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Virginia; these
         include a manuscript as to his opinions regarding the duties
         of the chair of chemistry and technical mechanics, a letter of
         recommendation on his behalf from G. F. B. Leighton, president
         of the Norfolk Horticultural and Pomological Society, to the
         Board of Visitors of the college (December 23, 1872), and a
         June, 1875 printed chemistry examination.</p>
      <p>Also among the clippings is an obituary notice regarding
         the death of Jackson's brother, Reverend William L. Jackson,
         pastor of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Norfolk. He died
         during the city's yellow fever epidemic on October 4, 1855 and
         was buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery. 
         <emph render="super">3</emph>His sermons, ca. 28 items, were
         used several times between 1826 and 1844; they bear
         corrections and notes and are numbered. Most were preached in
         Virginia and in what are now West Virginia locations:
         Winchester, Mill Creek, Chapel Green, Cool Spring, Charles
         Town, Henderson, Romney, Hampton, Alexandria, Culpeper,
         Charlottesville, Fredericksburg, Staunton, Middletown,
         Warrenton, Battletown, Martinsburg, Bristol, and Richmond.</p>

         Sanborn was shot to death by Wright on July 11, 1863. Wright
         was found guilty by a military commission but appealed to
         President Abraham Lincoln. A second hearing was held, the
         original verdict confirmed, and the doctor was hanged on
         October 23, 1863. See Ervin L. Jordan, Jr., "A Painful Case:
         The Wright-Sanborn Incident In Norfolk, Virginia,
