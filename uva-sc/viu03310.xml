        <p>Several separately accessioned collections have been
            interfiled because the material is so closely related. The
            major portion of the papers was given to the University
            library by Mr. Edward W. Gamble, Jr., 1817 Fendall Avenue,
            Charlottesville, Virginia, on July 14, 1975. This portion
            includes accession numbers 3825, 3847, 3847-a through
            3847-f, 3847-h, and 3847-j and was originally deposited at
            the library by Mrs. Edward W. Gamble, Jr., between the
            years 1951 and 1958. Mrs. Gamble was the daughter of
            University of Virginia professor Charles W. Kent and
            Eleanor Smith. In addition, accession number 2589 was given
            to the library by Mrs. Gamble on January 10, 1947, and
            accession number 3847-k was given to the library by Mrs.
            Gamble on January 13, 1965.</p>
        <p>Accession number 3847-g consists of 123 letters written
            to Maria Carter (Harrison) Broadus during the years
            1839-1857 and was given to the library by Dr. J. Hartwell

            Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, 721 Huntington Avenue, Boston,
            Massachusetts, 02115, on July 29, 1975. These letters were
            originally deposited at the library on April 6, 1954 by
            Mrs. Carrington Harrison, Dr. Harrison's mother. Accession
            number 3847-1 was a gift of Mrs. C. W. Kent on March 2,
            1975 and includes ca. 100 items for the period 1837-1900,
            consisting of papers of Lelia Tucker and of the Smith and
            Harrison families.</p>

      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Principal correspondents during the first half of the
         nineteenth century include Dr. Peachey Harrison (1777-1848) of
         Harrisonburg, Virginia, his wife Mary Stewart Harrison
         (1783-1857), and their children Edward Tiffin Harrison
         (1805-1828), Gessner Harrison (1807-1862), Mary Jane Harrison
         (1816-?), Margaret Frances (Harrison) Stevens (1819-1858),
         Caroline Elizabeth Harrison (1822-?), and Peachey Rush
         Harrison (1823-1852).</p>
      <p>Gessner Harrison was a student during the first session of
         the University of Virginia, graduating in 1828 in medicine and
         ancient languages. In 1828 he received a temporary appointment
         to the professorship of ancient languages at the University,
         succeeding George Long, and in 1829 received a permanent
         appointment. He served as chairman of the faculty a number of
         times. In 1859 he left the University to found a school of the
         classics in Belmont, Virginia. He married Eliza Lewis Carter
         Tucker, the University's first professor of moral
         philosophy.</p>
      <p>George Tucker (1775-1861) was born on Bermuda and at the
         age of twenty came to the College of William and Mary where
         his cousin St. George Tucker was a law professor and where he
         studied law. He was elected to the Virginia General Assembly
         in 1815 and served three terms in the House of
         Representatives, 1819-1825. He was appointed to the University
         of Virginia faculty in 1825, a position he resigned in 1845 in
         order to move to Philadelphia and devote his time to
         literature. While at the University he served as chairman of
         the faculty for several terms. Tucker wrote poetry and novels,
         a two-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson, and a statistical
         work

         Population and wealth in Fifty Years</title>in 1843. This
         collection includes the unpublished manuscript of one of his
         novels: 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Century Hence or A Romance of
         1941</title>. Tucker married three times. In 1797 he married
         Mary Byrd Farley who died in 1799. In 1802 he married Maria
         Ball Carter, the great niece of George Washington, who died in
         1823. His third wife was Louisa Bowdoin Thompson whom he
         married in 1828. She died in 1859. All of his children were
         born during his second marriage.</p>
      <p>Gassner Harrison's daughter Mary Stuart Harrison married
         Francis H. Smith, still another professor at the University.
         Smith (1829-1928) was a student at the University from
         1849-1851. He was appointed assistant to the Professor of
         Mathematics for 1851-1853 and was Professor of Natural
         Philosophy 1853-1907. He was Emeritus Professor in residence
         from 1907 till his death in 1928.</p>
      <p>Smith's daughter Eleanor married Charles W. Kent
         (1860-1917), Professor of German and French at University of
         Virginia from 1888-1893 and Professor of English literature
         from 1893-1917. He was the first literary editor of the
         sixteen volume 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Library of Southern Literature</title>,
         as well as the first editor of the University of Virginia 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Alumni Bulletin</title>. Charles Kent's
         papers include a number of letters from Woodrow Wilson and
         correspondence with Kent's brother Harry T. Kent, an attorney
         in St. Louis, Missouri. Kent's papers relate to a number of
         topics about the University including the Y.M.C.A., the
         founding of Madison Hall, and the possibility of coeducation
         at the University. There is a group of letters concerning
         Kent's running for the State Board of Education in 1906.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Tucker, Harrison, and Smith papers (accession numbers
         2589, 3825, 3847, 3947-a through 3847-h, and 3847-j through
         3847-l) consist of nineteen linear shelf feet (ca. 22,500
         items) ranging in date from 1790 through 1940. The collection
         consists of the correspondence and papers of members of
         several families linked together by marriage and in many cases
         connected to the University of Virginia. In addition to the
         correspondence, which is the major portion of the collection,
         there are manuscripts, including poems by George Tucker and
         his unpublished novel 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Century Hence or A Romance of
         1941</title>, diaries including one from the Civil War period,
         financial records, genealogical information, student
         notebooks, notebooks and papers of several University of
         Virginia professors, wills, and a few miscellaneous papers
         dealing with slaves.</p>
      <p>The correspondence, primarily among relative of the Tucker,
         Harrison, Smith, Kent, Lewis, Hamilton, Stevens, and Carter
         families, spans the entire nineteenth century and includes the
         correspondence of four University of Virginia professors -
         George Tucker, Gessner Harrison, Francis Henry Smith, and
         Charles William Kent. The families were, for the most part,
         located in Charlottesville or other areas of Virginia, but
         there is some correspondence with relatives in Kentucky and
         Ohio. Some of the correspondence mentions political issues of
         the day, but most of the letters concern family and personal
         affairs, with University life a frequent topic. The family
         letters discuss French lessons, boarding school, church
         activities, weddings, illnesses and deaths. There are letters
         from Gessner and Edward Tiffin Harrison describing life at the
         University in the first years of its existence, letters
         describing activities surrounding William H. McGuffey
         (1800-1873), who became Professor of Moral Philosophy at the
         University in 1845 and who is best known for his school
         reader, and letters discussing life in Harrisonburg, Virginia
         from the 1790's through the 1890's. The letters of George
         Tucker and his daughter Mary Lelia Tucker in the late 1840's
         describe life in Philadelphia. George Tucker described his
         travels in the South in 1860 and 1861, and Gessner Harrison's
         sons wrote a number of letters during the Civil War describing
         their experiences. There are also several letters written in
         the 1820's by Lieutenant Lawrence Fielding Carter who was
         serving in the United States Army and was stationed in Florida
         and the Arkansas territory.</p>
      <p>In addition to family correspondence, there are also a
         number of letters from other University of Virginia professors
         such as William B. Rogers, Charles S. Venable, John W. Mallet,
         John B. Minor and Maximilian Schele De Vere, among others, as
         well as the first president of the University, Edwin A.
         Alderman.</p>
      <p>Other notable correspondents include John Singleton Mosby,
         Thomas Nelson Page, and Woodrow Wilson. There are
         approximately twenty-five letters from Mosby, primarily to
         Francis H. Smith, during the years 1880- 1916. Smith was
         Mosby's professor at the University in the early 1850's. There
         is a similar number of letters from Woodrow Wilson to Charles
         W. Kent during the period 1880-1916. Wilson attended the
         University from 1879 through 1881 where he became friends with
         Kent. He continued to be interested in University happenings
         and in an 1894 letter expressed his opposition to coeducation
         at the University. In another letter he explained his reasons
         for turning down the presidency of the University of Virginia.
         Kent also corresponded with Thomas Nelson Page, and a few of
         Page's letters express his views on Southern literature.</p>
