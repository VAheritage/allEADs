</head>
      <p>Joseph L. Vaughan was the first Provost of the University of Virginia (1956-1960) under University President Colgate Darden. He was also Chancellor of the University of Virginia Branch Colleges (1960-1966)
under President Edgar Shannon. Vaughan was instrumental in upgrading George Mason College to a University and expanding Clinch Valley to a four year college. Most notably, he was considered to be one of the
University's all time great teachers. One of his greatest talents was his extraordinary ability to teach english literature to engineering students in order to give them a broader perspective on life as engineers.
</p>
      <p>He was born in Lynchburg, Virginia on January 26, 1905. He received all of his degrees from the University of Virginia (B.A. in 1926; MA in 1927; Ph.D. in 1940) He taught at the University of Virginia from 1926
to 1975. He was also well known for his knowledge and anecdotes of the University. He authored several books and publications including the Rotunda Tales (1991) which reveals the history of the University and its
presidents and professors.

Virginia, an invitation for his retirement reception and a Daily Progress article on his retirement (1975). There is also a large photograph of the U.S.S. Laffey (1944-1945); a typewritten poem by J. Wyllie titled
Chronicles of the class of '29; a newsletter for the Engineering Education Department called the American Society For Engineering Education, Liberal Studies Division (1970). The collection also includes some Kappa
Delta Sorority correspondence of Ann Doner Vaughan and miscellaneous memorabilia such as dinner place cards, a Pi Chi fraternity invitation, and a reminder of the "four c's" of clean living on a card that she may
