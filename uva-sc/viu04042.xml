      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection consists of the papers of Edward Jameson, a soldier in the 4th Battery of the Massachusetts Volunteers of the Federal Army, 21 items, ca 1861-1866. The letters are addressed to his brother, James Jameson, who resides in South Reading, Massachusetts. Most of the letters are written while Edward is stationed on Ship Island, Mississippi, and in Louisiana during the Civil War. One letter, April 11, 1864, is not from Edward Jameson, but is from Walter H. H[amner?]. 
</p>
      <p>Jameson writes to his brother, chiefly from Louisiana and Ship Island, Mississippi, about life in his Massachusetts Artillery battery. He mentions rebel steamers attempting to get past them or spy on them, the arrival of General Benjamin Butler, burning a Confederate camp and capturing a steamer, bombardment of Fort Jackson, war news and rumors from elsewhere, battle of Baton Rouge and the 7th Vermont, the destruction of the steamer Cotton by Godfrey Weitzel's expedition to Bayou Teche, election of 1864, various expeditions in Louisiana and Alabama, and an incident involving a Captain Grover and men of the 7th battery being mistaken for Jayhawkers. Two post-war letters discuss setting up a retail business in New Orleans.</p>
      <p>With the letters is a copy of General Order No. 62, Department of the Gulf, commending soldiers for action at Baton Rouge 1862 August  5, including three members of the 4th Massachusetts Battery.

          <p>Describes the island as barren and consisting of nothing but sand, except for the upper end which has pitch pine trees, a few palmettos, and a few prickly pears; some animal life consisting of a few raccoons, some wild cows and bullocks, and hogs, abandoned by the Southerners when the fort was evacuated;  they have been busy transporting the stores off of the S.S. Constitution, a large 3,575 ton side-wheel steamer, built in New York in 1861, and using the left-behind brick to build ovens, a cook house, and dig a well; he has also been training on the 9 inch gun which has no after wheels, so they have to be run out with a roller handspike and side tackles; he has recently seen Ezra Brown; they have a little steamer called the New London which is kept busy chasing the rebel steamers; other ships mentioned in the letter include: another steamer, the U.S.S. Massachusetts, also is at Ship Island, and the gunboat, the U.S.S. Cuyler, is also present.

          <p>Writes that the steamer Constitution arrived yesterday after leaving Fort Monroe only three days prior, bringing over 2,000 men including the fourth lieutenant and five men from his battery; says the Zouaves and Mounted Rangers that arrived on the Constitution are fine-looking men with fine uniforms and equipment; describes the excitement of the day when two rebel steamers attempted to either spy upon the island or run past it to Mobile, but were prevented by the actions of the Cuyler and Water Witch; also describes the dimensions and guns of the ship New London commanded by Captain Reed which was unable to participate because they had no steam on; has also heard that a large iron steamer the La Buan of Hull, England, has been captured off the Texan coast full of cotton worth $500,000 by the U.S. sloop of war Portsmouth; reports on the death from lung fever of a Mr. Richardson from Middleton Massachusetts, who had just arrived on the Constitution; and states that his ink is poor, being made from gunpowder and vinegar.
