      <p>This collection consists of seventy letters, July 23-October 12, 1944, of Joseph J.
                Jania to his wife [Florence?] in Chicago, Illinois, while he was stationed at Fort
                Belvoir, Virginia. Jania describes his life and daily activities at Fort Belvoir
                while he was a member of Student Company H, S.S.R. Jania was enrolled in the Map
                Reproduction Course, Engineer School. He had previously been stationed at Camp
                Gruber, Oklahoma, before his transfer.</p>
      <p>According to their website about historic Belvoir, "In March 1941, the Engineer
                Replacement Training Center facility began to provide basic military engineer
                training to draftees. Originally, the ERTC program was designed as a 12 week course,
                but its duration was shortened to eight weeks early in 1942, when the demand for
                troops escalated dramatically after Pearl Harbor. A similar curriculum was offered
                at the ERTCs at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri and later at Camp Abbot in Oregon.
                Recruits were schooled in reconnaissance, unit coordination, road and obstacle
                construction, and demolition. After mid-1942, Belvoir began training engineer
                specialists in operating construction machinery, carpentry, drafting, and surveying.
                Instruction also was offered for such non-engineering specialties as truck driving,
                cooking, and baking. As the war progressed and new weapons were developed,
                specialized courses in weapons operation were added to the curriculum. Engineers
                learned about tanks and their uses, flamethrowers, and anti-aircraft guns. By the
                end of the war in 1945, the ERTC at Fort Belvoir had trained roughly 147,000
                engineer troops (http://www.belvoir.army.mil/default.asp).</p>
