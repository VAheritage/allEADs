         father's activities in Charlottesville and Norfolk.</p>
      <p>Other letters to Williams Thomas and Caroline Virginia
         (Robinson) Davis include a letter, October 27, 1867, from
         Agnes I. Duval in Floral Bank, British Honduras, describing
         her new life and the plans for same. She mentions Mr. Duval
         and R. F. Ledbetter having plans to have a steamboat on the
         river; wishing that Miss Lacy could come and be a teacher to
         her children climate permitting; and, having her guitar sent

         Carroll from New Orleans; taking time to love and enjoy her
         children; worry over "Tom" who has been exhibiting the same
         symptoms of coughing and bronchitis as when at Randolph-Macon
         College; family news; and, the death of sister "Eliza." A
         February 4, 1875 letter to "Carrie" concerns a financial
         matter involving articles bought for Mary and Jennie; the
         practicality of getting a set of lower teeth; James [Carroll]
         not returning to his family; the improvement in Tom's health;
         hard times in Louisiana; and, the death of "Rebecca" due to
         heart disease.</p>
      <p>There is an interesting letter, January 22, 1877, from S.
         O. Harris, Royal Oak, Talbot County, Maryland, to Caroline
         Davis, concerning an extract from 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Godey's Lady Book</title>on the
         schooling of children and giving a discourse on female
         education. The correspondent writes that "the education of men
         and women should have some reference to their intellectual
         organization and capacities..."; advises "a harmonious
         development of the moral, physical and intellectual being" as
         the kind of education required for women; warns against
         "overtasking the youthful intellect of American girls"; asks
         that his motive not be taken unkindly; and, praises the course
         of study at the Southern Female College.</p>
      <p>On August 6, 1879, "Carrie" Davis, Southern Female College,
         writes to her mother, Caroline Davis, mentioning attending
         protracted meetings, news of "Kittie" and George Drew, and
         life at Southern Female College. On August 25, 1880, Williams
         Thomas Davis writes his wife, "Carrie" [Caroline Virginia
         (Robinson) Davis], about the activities of the family; hearing
         excellent sermons by [John Cowper] Granberry (1829- 1907) at
         Market Street Church; and, imploring her to use her influence
         to find some students for their school. On August 28, 1880,
         Davis writes his children in Brunswick County an interesting
         letter giving his opinions on "the system of labor and
         arrangements of society," "masters &amp; servants," and the
         mental energy of white people in contrast to the physical
         energy of "colored" people. He also advises them on how to be
         useful and happy and encourages the love of family and God. A
         touching letter, July 15, 1886, from Alice Clark expresses
         sympathy over the death of young "Carrie" Davis, empathizes
         with the loss of a loved one, expresses her own sorrow over
         losing her husband Emery, and gives religious encouragement.
         There is also a letter, February 8, 1904, from Robert Good
         Southall (1852-1924), House of Representatives, sending a copy
         of the Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley, eulogies. There is a
         carte-de-visite of Williams Thomas Davis as a mature
         gentleman.</p>
      <p>Papers of the Davis family pertain to financial matters
         during 1854-1857. There is a letter, February 5, 1860,
         concerning the hire of one of the best overseers in Warren and
         discussing his character, work skills, and recent endeavors
         and advising the recipient on how to treat him. An August 6
         letter, from James A. Davis in Pilgrim's Rest concerns a trip
         near Petersburg to Suffolk and Norfolk. A copy of a 1912
         letter pertains to Seacrist Gold Mining Company, Petersburg,
         and contains a report of an examination of the property.</p>
      <p>Papers of the Robinson family include letters, January 13
         and March 28, 1852, from John B. Robinson, "Lebanon," Norfolk,
         to Mrs. [Ann] Clark Robinson, Brunswick County, concerning
         studying and wearing the uniform at the academy; being
         examined in February by many of the citizens of Norfolk; news
         of the marriage of Nelly Moseley; the suicide during a state
         of intoxication of David Kyle; snow killing many peaches,
         apricots, strawberries and other fruits; a young
         African-American being burnt by drinking hot grease and being
         treated by linseed oil; Aunt Martha having land cleared; and,
         his sisters Rowena, Lucy and Caroline. He comments on suicide,
         saying "these worldly minded men have nothing to support them
         in times of trouble give way to despair and plunge into
         eternal ruin." There are also two letters, January 6 and June
         3, 1877, from Allen Y. and John B. Robinson in Orcus Island,
         Washington, stating their reasons for staying in such an
         outlandish country as the healthiness of the country and
         waiting to secure titles to their claims and the funds to pay
         for them. They write that they are providing assistance to
         needy families and selling eggs. They reveal that their plans
         to return to Virginia in 1862 were thwarted by the Civil War,
         and that they instead went to Caribou, British Columbia and
         built a large brick building in Victoria, British Columbia,
         which has deteriorated in value. They state that in 1864 they
         started trading on Puget Sound, Washington and afterwards took
         up two government land claims on Orcas Island. They admit that
         they cannot return to Virginia until receiving the title from
         the United States Government. The marriage of [Caroline
         Virginia (Robinson)] to [Williams Thomas] Davis is also
         mentioned.</p>
      <p>Papers of William A. Shepard and Martha (Davis) Shepard
         include four letters. On August 5, 1866, there is a letter
         from Millville, Brunswick County, about a quarterly meeting
         conducted in Lawrenceville; personal and family news; travel
         plans and other activities; the damage caused by a
         thunderstorm; the meager wheat crops, splendid oat crops, and
         promising corn and tobacco crops; the difficulties in sending
         the daughters of local families back to school; and, news of
         the Price family and the Ashton Lewises. Letters of September
         1866 mention travel in Virginia, interviewing a scholar, the
         visiting Davis children in Pilgrim's Rest, and Riddick having
         130 pupils with daily arrivals, and request that catalogues be
         sent. An October 8, [1889] letter reveals that they helped fix
         up a little church in the country and attended a dedication
         with Dr. Kern and mentions "Charlie," a bright young man and
         good football player.</p>
