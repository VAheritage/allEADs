</head>
      <p>The collection contains two typescripts by Ted Wilentz "The Kaddish manuscript" explaining his purchase of the Ginsberg manuscript and "Some words on Allen Ginsberg who deserves many." 
</p>
      <p>The collection contains three brief letters to Ginsberg from Charles Plymell, Bob Rosenthal, and Theodorre Willentz, 1968-1984, mention a contract, and Peter Orlovsky.</p>
      <p>The collection consists chiefly of letters to Ted Wilentz, 1962-1990, discussing his current writing and other activities. Specific topics include trip to India, current crises in Cuba and India, finances, music, Buddhism, conferences and readings. He mentions William S. Burroughs, Lucien Carr, Robert Frank, Peter Orlovsky, Bertrand Russell, and Anne Waldman.</p>
      <p>Letters to Willentz from James E. Breslin, Louis Ginsberg, Cordula [Koschembahr?] and Bill Morgan discuss permission to quote, a festschrift in honor of Ginsberg's 60th birthday, and Morgan's work on Ginsberg. A photograph of Ginsberg with [Amiri Baraka?] is enclosed in the letter from Cordula. There is a brief note from Ginsberg on the verso of the Breslin letter.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains photographs and sketches, chiefly of Ginsberg and Orlovsky, and also a Viet Nam war protest. Additional miscellaneous materials include a review of "Kaddish and other poems, 1958-1960, by Harvey Shapiro; a newsletter  concerning the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Coloradlo, and The Jack Kerouac Poetics School; and a broadside from the Neptune Theatre Liverpool advertising an Allen Ginsberg poetry reading.</p>

                            almost exclusively a hip pot smoking scene for the last 2,000 years,

                            Cuba [the Cuban Missile Crisis?] and the Indo-China War of 1962,
                            summarizing "these crises are artificial nerve-wars organized by
