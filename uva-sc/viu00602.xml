      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>Papers, 1820-1882, chiefly of Septimia Randolph Meikleham, include correspondence concerning Monticello, Edgehill, the University of Virginia, family matters, social life in Virginia, Boston, Mass., and Washington, D.C., her schoolmates in Cambridge, Mass., travel in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York, courtship, and fashion; narratives about the Lewis and Clark expeditions, Monticello, and James and Dolley Madison; legal papers; and poetry.
</p>
      <p>The papers also contain miscellaneous correspondence, 1836-1839, of the Randolph, Meikleham, Coolidge, and Bankhead families, concerning family and social matters, travelling to Havana, Cuba, and a trip to Philadelphia, Pa., during which Martha Jefferson Randolph sat for a portrait by Thomas Sully; and three letters, 1840-1844, from Dolley Madison to Septimia Randolph Meikleham relating to social and family matters, and specifically Meikleham's marriage.
</p>
      <p>Of particular note are letters from Meriwether Lewis Randolph concerning life in the frontier town of Little Rock, Ark., including fighting off wolves;  a letter, 28 August 1825, from John Hemings, a slave, to Septimia Randolph pertaining to the grounds at Poplar Forest; a letter, ca. 1829, from Martha Jefferson Randolph, Lynchburg, Va., to Septimia Randolph, Edgehill, Va., providing an account of her trip to Lynchburg, sewing; and a letter from George Wythe Randolph, 1860 October 14, speculating on the effect of Lincoln's election on the South.
</p>
      <p>There is also a letter, 1843 October 2, from Edward Everett, London, Eng., involving the "Cary estate" and his admiration for Thomas Jefferson; and a letter, 30 January 1878, from Charles Stewart Parnell, Rathdrum, Ireland, to Septimia Randolph Meikleham, concerning his mother's visit to the United States.
</p>
      <p>Of particular interest are a letter, 1792 November 2, from Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Mann Randolph, concerning family matters and Virginia politics and mentioning Madison and Monroe; a letter, 1820 April 17, from John St. George Randolph, Amelia County, Va., to Thomas Mann Randolph, Richmond, Va., on the dismissal of an overseer; and a list, ca. 1821, in Thomas Jefferson's hand, of slaves' bread distribution.
</p>
      <p>A letter from Archibald Cary at the University of Virginia, to Septimia Randolph, 1834 Dec. 15, mentions that her "acquaintance A. F. E. Robertson (the young man you saw at Davis' &amp; thought so handsome) was shot in the back by an old fellow, while endeavoring to take a dead negro for our anatomical dissections."
</p>
      <p>Additional items include drafts of poems by Septimia Randolph, and Mrs. Hemans, fragments of Cornelia Randolph's music, and a photograph of an unidentified family home.

She says that Lucia Swett reminds her of "Dolly Cutts, but yet she is by no means ugly."  She also says, "I am attending a course of lectures on the subject of natural history by the by, the lecture is every Tuesday night and the price of a ticket of admission is $1, but I paid nothing for mine as I found on arriving, that Mr. Bulfinch had already made sister Ellen and myself a present of our tickets.  That you might not be jealous however of my superior advantages I must tell you that I do not expect to acquire any [special]? degree of knowledge from them, the introductory lecture delivered by a young man of the name [Ralph Waldo] Emerson was a beautiful one but I fancy the succeeding lecturers, for there are several, are not very distinguished."
