      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of four items, 1863-1865, two
         printed Confederate General Orders issued by General Samuel
         Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General's Office, Richmond,
         Virginia, and two letters from Union soldiers to their
         families.</p>
      <p>General Orders Number 33, March 26, 1863, is comprised of
         five paragraphs. The first concerns the organization of the
         ordnance officer's corps and the second announces that all
         officers assigned to ordnance duty but not to the corps itself
         will eventually be relived by appointed corps officers. The
         third paragraph orders officers in charge of arsenals and
         depots to submit monthly reports "to prevent fraudulent
         claims" by men who have relinquished their soldier's pay and
         are detailed at those facilities as full-time employees. The
         fourth paragraph orders officers commanding military
         departments to require their provost marshals and prison
         commandants to report monthly on those persons held in
         confinement other than soldiers. The fifth paragraph amends
         General Orders Number 31 and pertains to officers' commutation
         value of their transportation while on furlough.</p>
      <p>General Orders Number 72, June 1, 1863, pertain to the
         court marital of Captain Williams S. Rowan, Company A (Beirne
         Sharpshooters), 60th Virginia Infantry, held on May 5, 1863 at
         Gray Sulphur Springs, Virginia. He had been found guilty and
         ordered to be dismissed from Confederate service but his case
         was reviewed by the Secretary of War [James A. Seddon] who
         ordered him restored to duty. (Rowan was later promoted to the
         rank of major in 1864.)</p>
      <p>The first of the letters, September 17, 1864, is from
         Private George N. Aumiller, Company A, 208th Pennsylvania
         Volunteers (Army of the James), to his mother and sister,
         Catherine, of Dalmatia, Northumberland County, Pennsylvania.
         Aumiller, writing from Bermuda Hundred, Virginia, discusses
         his regiment's journey from Harrisonburg to Baltimore where it
         was transferred to a steamboat for the remainder of the trip
         (thirty-six hours); he and several of his comrades became
         seasick. Places mentioned along the way include Fort Monroe,
         Harrison's Landing, the James River, Bermuda Hundred and
         "Citicens Point" (City Point). According to Samuel Bates' 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">History of Pennsylvania
         Volunteers,</title>Volume V, page 695, Aumiller had enlisted
         on August 26, 1864 and was mustered out with his company on
         June 1, 1865.</p>
      <p>The second letter, January 1, 1865, is from Private A. S.
         Miller, Company C, 7th Regiment, Veterans Reserve Corps (First
         Battalion), to his wife. Miller, writing from the Rush
         Barracks in Washington, D. C., wishes her a Merry Christmas
         and hopes the war will end soon. Tired of being away from her
         and suffering from "the blues", he complains about officers
         "putting on airs", the strictness of regulations, and that he
         has no money to send her. He also remarks that his unit had
         been marched to a hospital where it was served Christmas
         dinner but anticipates that he will soon be in the guardhouse
         as military life is too burdensome. (Miller's regiment was
         organized on October 10, 1863; the Veterans Reserve Corps,
         formerly the Invalid Corps until March 1864, was comprised of
         two battalions. First Battalion men were convalescents fit
         enough to guard prisoners, buildings, etc.; Second Battalion
         men had suffered injures so severe as to confine them to desk
         work.)</p>
