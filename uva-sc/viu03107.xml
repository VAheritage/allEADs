         <p>This collection consists of typescripts of 55 letters,
         1834-1840, from Thomas W. White to Nathaniel Beverley Tucker.
         Thomas Willis White (1788-1843) was the printer and founder of
         the 
         <title render="italic">Southern Literary Messenger</title>.
         After establishing a successful printing business in Richmond,
         Virginia, White contracted to reprint the 
         <title render="italic">Journal</title>of both houses of the
         Virginia Assembly from 1777 to 1790 and the convention of
         1778. He also printed books by local authors. The first issue
         of the 
         <title render="italic">Southern Literary Messenger</title>came
         off the press in August 1834 under White's direction. In the
         same year, White began a correspondence with Judge Nathaniel
         Beverley Tucker of the College of William and Mary. Tucker's
         editorial advice influenced White enormously, as well as the
         advice he received from Lucian Minor. Edgar Allan Poe began
         contributing to the 
         <title render="italic">Messenger</title>in 1835, and by the
         end of that year, he became its editor. However, White was not
         satisfied with Poe's editorial style, and was relieved when he
         left the position in 1837. After this period, White relied
         heavily on Tucker and Minor for editorial advice. This
         collection is part of White and Tucker's correspondence over
         editorial issues for the 
         <title render="italic">Messenger</title>.</p>
         <p>Nathaniel Beverley Tucker (1784-1851) was appointed a
         professor of law at William and Mary in 1834, and he remained
         in this position until his death. He was most influential as a
         lecturer and correspondent. Through his letter writing, he
         spread his political views, probably the chief of which was
         his belief in state sovereignty. He wrote and published three
         novels that were centered on his political views.</p>
