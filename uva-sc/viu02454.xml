        <p>This collection was given to the Library by Mr. and Mrs.
            Charles M. Davison of Charlottesville, Virginia, on
            December 2, 1986.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>These fifty-six items, 1921-1976, consist chiefly of
         letters from Margaret and James Branch Cabell, Willa Cather,
         Donald Davidson, Ellen Glasgow, DuBose and Dorothy Heyward,
         and Walter de la Mare to University of Virginia English
         Professor James Southall Wilson (1880-1963) and his wife
         Julia. The collection also contains printed material
         pertaining to these same authors.</p>
      <p>Most of these letters originated through Wilson's
         involvement with the Southern Writers Conferences held at the
         University of Virginia and at Charleston, South Carolina, and
         his work as editor of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Quarterly
         Review,</title>1925-1930.</p>
      <p>The letters from James Branch Cabell (1879-1958) and his
         wife Margaret congratulate Wilson for his Edgar Allan Poe
         article in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Quarterly Review</title>and
         praises the story "The Holy Bottle" (March 27, 1926); politely
         refuses to discuss his works at the University of Virginia
         (December 8, 1928); mentions his obligation to autograph
         volumes of his unfinished 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Biography of the Life of
         Manuel</title>as an excuse for declining to write for 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Quarterly
         Review</title>(December 16, 1929); speaks of the impending
         arrival of a "little paper" for Wilson (possibly "Sanctuary in
         Porcelain" which appeared in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Quarterly Review</title>in
         July of 1930--May 10 &amp; 20, 1930); agrees to hold the
         second Southern Writers Conference in Charleston, South
         Carolina (May 12, 1932); discusses the disposition of his
         papers to Alderman Library and why he feels uncomfortable with
         them going to the University of Virginia; refers to the very
         negative review of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Let Me Lie</title>by University of
         Virginia professor Dan S. Norton (attached), with Francis L.
         Berkeley's letter to Wilson urging him to help the Library
         acquire Cabell's papers (April 26 &amp; 30, 1948); shares the
         state of Cabell's health after his stroke (March 25, 1957);
         and includes greeting cards, thanks, and invitations (December
         21, 1956; July 17, 1962; March 24, 1965; and n.d.).</p>
      <p>A single letter of Willa Cather (1873-1947) to Mr.
         [Stringfellow] Barr responds negatively to an invitation to
         lecture at the University of Virginia due to unsettled family
         conditions, although she says that "I always feel very deeply
         that I am a Virginian" (December 5, 1928).</p>
      <p>Donald Davidson (1893-1968) thanks the Wilsons for their
         praise of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Long Street,</title>refers to their
         association at the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference in Vermont,
         and discusses the connection of his poem, "Gradual of the
         Northern Summer," and his home "Endicott" (December 20,
         1961).</p>
      <p>Ellen Glasgow (1873-1945) refers to the first Southern
         Writers Conference held at the University with 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Quarterly
         Review</title>editors as hosts (November 28, 1931); thanks
         Wilson for the essay given her at Christmas (January 7, 1932);
         agrees that Charleston, next to the University, is the best
         place for the second Southern Writers Conference (May 10,
         1932); issues invitations to lunch (February 6, April 14,
         &amp; May 3, 1938); and sends postcards (August 22, 1931 &amp;
         September 4, 1939). Included with her letters is a letter from
         H. Blair Rouse to Wilson which asks permission to use the
         correspondence at the University of Virginia between Glasgow
         and Wilson in his book (February 29, 1952).</p>
      <p>DuBose (1885-1940) and Dorothy (1890- ? ) Heyward's
         correspondence discusses his inability to visit the University
         of Virginia or to furnish the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Quarterly Review</title>with
         any material due to the difficulty that writing presents to
         him (October 20, 1929); discusses his arrangements for Wilson
         to attend the Charleston Conference (October 8, 1932);
         describes his new cabin on Folly Island, South Carolina, and
         promises to review favorably a book of poetry for Wilson
         (March 18, 1933); rejects Sewanee as the next conference
         meeting place and cancels plans for that year, and also
         mentions seeing [John ?] Newcomb at the White Top Folk
         Festival in southern Virginia (August 18, 1933); regrets a
         missed rendezvous with the Wilsons during their trip to
         Charleston (March 29, 1936); and writes about "Porgy" (May 23,
         1958). Dorothy Heyward also speaks of going to the Huntington
         Hartford Foundation for writers in order to finish a book
         begun in summer (January 14, 1960).</p>
      <p>Walter de la Mare (1873-1956) responds to the request of
         John Calvin Metcalf and Wilson for a contribution to the Edgar
         Allan Poe Centennial Volume (published as 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Enchanted Years</title>) by sending
         a poem entitled "Goodbye" (January 30 &amp; March 1, 1921); he
         describes his enchantment with Virginia and mentions that his
         literary agent had forwarded a copy of his March lecture
         before the Royal Society of Literature on women novelists of
         the seventies to [New York], which would be published in
         America by Macmillan, and suggests it as a possible piece for
         the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Quarterly
         Review</title>(February 6, 1929); he regrets Wilson's decision
         to cease editing the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Quarterly Review</title>(March
         21, 1930); and thanks Wilson for giving Edward O'Brien
         permission to reprint "Willows," which had appeared in the
         October 1929 issue of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Quarterly Review</title>(May
         21,1930).</p>
      <p>The printed material includes: an issue of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Poetry</title>(December 1923),
         containing poems of DuBose Heyward; newsclippings regarding
         the second Southern Writers Conference in Charleston (October
         22, 1932); a copy of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The American Spectator</title>(April
         1933) including James Branch Cabell's "Soliloquy Before
         Printing"; a book review and a promotional pamphlet for Ellen
         Glasgow's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Certain Measure</title>(1943); 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Richmond
         Times-Dispatch's</title>tribute to Glasgow upon her death
         (November 22, 1945); Edmund Wilson's discussion of James
         Branch Cabell in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The New Yorker</title>(April 21, 1956);
         other newsclippings regarding Cabell (1958-1976); and two
         undated clippings about Walter de la Mare at the University of
         Virginia and Dorothy Heyward.</p>
