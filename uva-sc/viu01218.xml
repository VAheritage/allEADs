      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of forty-six letters, 1811-1863,
         all but one written to Robert Thruston Hubard (1808-1871),
         including thirty business letters in two folders, 1848-1853,
         from Alfred T. Harris, of the firm Harris &amp; Gibson,
         regarding the stock, bond, and tobacco markets in Virginia and
         Europe, miscellaneous orders for plaster, marble slabs, guano,
         ox chains, adzes, and other specialty items to be sent to him
         by boat, and the affairs of the Bank of Virginia (1853 Jan
         17). One early letter from Lenaeus Bolling to his mother,
         Susanna (Bolling) Wilcox, (1811 July 17) pleads with her not
         to abandon living at "Chellowe," Buckingham County, Virginia,
         the home of her first husband, Robert Bolling.</p>
      <p>The remainder of the letters are from family members and
         friends to Robert T. Hubard, including George Jones, Tye River
         Warehouse, concerning the sale of slaves belonging to Dr.
         Ligon (1848 Dec 20); Beverley Hargrove, with a proposal to
         erect a sawmill and build a small dam across the Tye River to
         power it, adjoining Hubard's property (1849 Mar 15); and
         Richard G. Morris discussing the basis of representation in
         Congress, writing that "...for I am satisfied if the West ever
         have the controlling power in laying taxes that our slaves
         will be heavily taxed" (1850 Jun 13).</p>
      <p>Three letters are from Hubard's brother, Edmund Wilcox
         Hubard (1806-1878) while he was a member of the United States
         House of Representatives, discussing the illness of his
         daughter Polly and other family news, the debates in
         Washington concerning the Compromise of 1850, Henry Clay and
         his political aspirations, Free Soilers, the Missouri
         Compromise, the Fugitive Slave Law and slavery in the
         territories, particularly New Mexico (1850 June 19, June 25,
         and July 2).</p>
      <p>Five letters are from his son, William Bolling Hubard
         (1836-1884) written to his father while he was attending
         school at "Wigwam," Virginia (185[1?] January 10, 1852
         February 14, March 6, April 18, and May 1), one with news of a
         local murder involving a Mr. Tucker and Mr. Smith (1852 March
         6). One letter is from his son, James Lenaeus Hubard
         (1835-1913) while he was attending the Virginia Military
         Institute (1852 April 2).</p>
      <p>There is one Civil War era letter from Robert Thruston
         Hubard, Jr., of the [3rd?] Virginia Cavalry, discussing
         problems with food preparation at camp, the need for a pack
         horse or mule, plans on hiring the Negroes, Robert and
         [Thruston?], brothers of Jim Smith of "Caira" to act as
         hostler and cook, the three day drill and review of the troops
         by General Fitz Lee in preparation for their march to the
         headquarters of Robert E. Lee, where Stuart's entire division,
         except for Jones' Brigade presently n the Valley, will be
         reviewed by Lee (1863 Jan 9).</p>
