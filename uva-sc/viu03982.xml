      <head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Charles Engelbrecht (nicknamed Chut) lived in the Bronx, New York when he joined the service and became a sailor at the Naval Air Station in Norfolk, Virginia. He worked as a clerk in a clothing and supply store for the Navy Small Stores. He writes of his desire to be shipped into action but the Waves (his officers) at the store are successful in keeping him out of any action for the entire two and a half years of his duty. It is not clear if the Waves were trying to protect him or if they could not spare him due to the quality of his work. Whenever orders came for him to be moved out, they fought for him to stay. He continued to work at the store, moving cartons of supplies and requisitioning orders while his friends and other soldiers in the barracks are shipped overseas. 
</p>
      <p>
The other letters are written by Margie Kratzer's maternal uncles: Ernie [Emil] Egerter, Willie Egerter, Henry Egerter and Fred Egerter who were in the service. After the end of the war Margie's Uncle Emil who served in the Philippines dies.
</p>
      <p>
The letters reveal that Charles has a good relationship with Margie's family and one letter suggests that Margie's mother may suffer from alcoholism.  Margie's father and grandmother are mentioned in the letters but only in vague references. The letters reveal that the family lived in a bad neighborhood in Harlem where there were sometimes acts of violence, even murder.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection of 3 hollinger boxes, 1.5 linear feet, and 531 items contains the correspondence (1943-1946) of a young sailor from World War II, Charles Engelbrecht to his girlfriend, Margie Kratzer, of New York while he is posted at the Naval Air Station in Norfolk, Virginia. There are also letters (1935-1942; 1945-1946) from the uncles of Margie Kratzer: Ernie (Emil) Egerter, William (Willie) Egerter, Henry Egerter and Fred Egerter who are also in the service during the war. There are also letters from another young man in the service, James S. Connolly who claims to be in love with Margie.
</p>
      <p>
The correspondence describes the loneliness and displacement of a nineteen year old American boy from the Bronx and the impact of the war on his relationship with his girlfriend. The letters also describe political events, war news and American views on the war. There is also some racial bias expressed in the letters, particularly from the uncles of Margie Kratzer.
</p>
      <p>
Some of the war references in the letters mention military ships and aircraft carriers such as the U.S.S. Boxer, the cruiser U.S.S. Philadelphia, and the aircraft carriers  U.S.S. Block Island and U.S.S. Franklin. There are also references to the Sea Bees.
</p>
      <p>
There is also a pornographic story titled "My Trip to the Country."
</p>
      <p>
There is a collection of photographs and negatives of Margie Kratzer, Charles Englebrecht and their friends.
</p>
      <p>
There is printed material from the Navy which is enclosed with the letters and is titled <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">NAS Dope Sheet</title>. There is also a booklet from the Naval Training Center and miscellaneous poems and postcards and a war memorandum about the Manhattan Engineer District Project.

          <p>On May 22, 1944 Charles Engelbrecht writes, "The reason I don't like the Coast Guard, Margie, is because I found out that guys that join the 'Jewish Navy' (that's what they're called) only join because they know that they'll go up &amp; down the coast &amp; never go out!"  He also writes, "I can't see why you don't like the Merchant Marine, because those guys have got guts."
</p>
          <p>
On May 23, 1944 he mentions the racial tensions among the service men when he writes, "That's about the 3rd fight between a black &amp; a white in about the last week &amp; a half."
