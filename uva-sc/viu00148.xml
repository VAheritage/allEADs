      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Bryan Family papers comprise ca. 645 items spanning the
         years 1770-1918. Most of the collection is correspondence
         among Randolph, Tucker, and Bryan family members from
         1770-1850, representing some twenty correspondents (see
         attached appendix). There are also two letters from William
         Wirt to John Coalter. Miscellany and some printed matter
         complete the collection.</p>
      <p>Students seeking to understand the relationships of the
         various Randolph s, Tucker s, Coalter s, and Bryan s who are
         represented copiously in the Bryan Papers must turn to the
         history of the Randolph Family of Virginia. John Randolph, Sr.
         (1742-1775) was the scion of a successful but not notably
         "elite" Virginia family. (cf. William E. Stokes, Jr.,
         "Randolph of Roanoke: A Virginia Portrait; The Early Career of
         John Randolph of Roanoke, 1773-1805," U. Va. Doctoral
         Dissertation, 1955, pp. 15-16.) Randolph married his second
         cousin, Frances Bland (sister of Theodorick Bland ) in 1769,
         and they had three children: Richard Randolph, Theodorick
         Randolph, and John Randolph.</p>
      <p>John Randolph, Sr., died in October, 1775, leaving his
         young wife with three small boys to raise. She did not,
         however, raise them alone for long. In September, 1778,
         Frances Bland Randolph married St. George Tucker (1752-1827),
         a native of Bermuda who had emigrated to Virginia to pursue a
         career at the bar. Tucker and his wife inherited the Randolph
         estates, living at Matoax. They had several children before
         Frances Randolph Tucker died in 1788, among them Frances
         Tucker ("Fanny," b. 1779), Henry St. George Tucker (b. 1780),
         and Nathaniel Beverly Tucker (b. 1784).</p>
      <p>Much of the correspondence in the Bryan Papers is carried
         on by these people, including several letters to John
         Randolph, Sr., (for the period 1770-1774) by his friend
         Theodorick Bland. The great majority of the Bland letters
         discuss business matters. Most of the letters collected here
         were penned by John Randolph, Jr., (known after 1810 as John
         Randolph of Roanoke ) and his step-father, St. George
         Tucker.</p>
      <p>Every evidence in his correspondence suggests that St.
         George Tucker was a remarkably warm and compassionate human
         being, as well as an able lawyer, scholar, and jurist. (There
         is no adequate biography of Tucker, but see Charles T. Cullen,
         "St. George Tucker and Law in Virginia, 1772-1804," U. Va.
         Doctoral Dissertation, 1971.) Tucker raised a large family,
         including his step-sons, with great solicitude and continued
         corresponding with most of his children through his and their
         lives. ( John Randolph of Roanoke was an exception. See
         Accession 
         <num type="accession">#49</num>, Grinnan Family Papers, 1813
         Dec. 13, John Randolph of Roanoke to Tudor.)</p>
      <p>Tucker's letters illuminate the early life of the brilliant
         and erratic John Randolph of Roanoke, who served Virginia as
         congressman and senator for nearly thirty years (1799-1813,
         1815-1817, 1819-1829). At age nine Randolph was enrolled with
         his older brothers in a school conducted (first in
         Chesterfield County and then at Williamsburg ) by Walker
         Maury, and he remained there two years (1782-1784). After
         several years with his family, including a sojourn with the
         Tuckers in Bermuda, Randolph was sent to Princeton grammar
         school in 1787, and then to Columbia College, along with his
         brother Theodorick Randolph. Several of St. George Tucker's
         letters to his step-sons at school are preserved here,
         including one missive admonishing Theodorick for his
         profligacy and tendency to drunkenness (see Tucker to Theo
         Randolph, August 30, 1789).</p>
      <p>Most of the St. George Tucker correspondence in this
         collection was addressed not to his Randolph step-children (or
         to his children by Frances Bland Randolph Tucker, for that
         matter), but to Joseph Carrington Cabell. Cabell, who in 1807
         married Mary (Poll) Carter, the daughter of Tucker's third
         wife, was for many years a Virginia State Senator as well as a
         planter. Tucker's letters to him (totalling 165 in this
         collection) bulk heavy with family talk, discussion of joint
         business operations relating to their plantations, as well as
         political commentary. The papers are a significant aid to any
         student of either man's career, but particularly contribute to
         a comprehensive picture of St. George Tucker's life and
         thought.</p>
      <p>Apart from family and business matters, Tucker's letters to
         Cabell (none of Cabell's responses are preserved here) touch
         upon such concerns as the Louisiana Purchase (Jan. 23, 1804);
         American relations with England during the administrations of
         Thomas Jefferson and James Madison (letters of July 30, 1807,
         Feb. 1, 1809, Jan. 24, April 1, 1812); proposed changes in the
         Virginia Constitution (Dec. 20, 1809, Jan. 17, 1810); various
         reforms Tucker felt essential in Virginia (Dec. 22, 1806); the
         utility of banks and the attitude of the legislature towards
         banking (Jan. 3, 1812, Feb. 12, 1813, Jan. 17, 20, 24, Dec.
         23, 1814, Jan. 30, 1817, Feb. 4, 1818); activities in the
         Virginia legislature (Feb. 8, 12, 1813); and the War of 1812,
         most particularly as it affected Virginia (July 9, 1812, March
         31, April 7, 14, June 30, 1813, Jan. 2, April 4, Sept. 1, Dec.
         9, 1814, Feb. 6, 1815).</p>
      <p>The letters reveal Tucker's concern for improvement. As he
         wrote to Cabell, Dec. 22, 1806, "I heartily wish our
         Legislators would turn their attention to the improvement of
         our revenue; of our miserable defective judiciary system; of
         our equally defective system of Education; and to the averting
         from the poor the impending calamities of famine; a subject
         more truly interesting than any Question who is right, &amp;
         who is wrong in Congress, at present." They show, moreover,
         that Tucker believed in a well regulated system of state
         banks, and was extremely frustrated when the strict
         construction doctrines of most Virginia legislators placed
         obstacles in the way of such a system. The weakness this meant
         for the state's economic development and general governmental
         flexibility was driven home during the War of 1812, and Tucker
         constantly harangued his friend Cabell on the subject (see
         esp. letters of Feb. 8, 12, 1813). "Do, for heaven's sake
         endeavour to rouse a proper degree of exertion among those
         members of the House of Delegates, who affect to call
         themselves the friends of their country. PENURY at this time
         if not worse, is full as bad as Yankee Federalism."</p>
      <p>Tucker's correspondence with Joseph C. Cabell continued
         until the year of his death, 1827, and it would appear that
         most of it has been preserved here. These letters do not,
         however, exhaust the Tucker materials in the Bryan Papers.
         There is an extended correspondence with John Coalter (a
         Tucker family tutor who eventually married Fanny Randolph
         Tucker and entered into business with St. George Tucker ),
         basically business oriented; seventeen letters, 1822-1826,
         from Elizabeth Tucker Coalter Bryan (Tucker's grand-daughter)
         to Tucker and his wife; and one letter to St. George Tucker
         written by his grandson, St. George Coalter, describing in
         detail his routine at the University of Virginia (letter of
         April 16, 1826). A note in Tucker's hand at the letter's end
         mentions that he answered very "fully &amp; affectionately,"
         and included advice to work hard and spend time with the right
         company.</p>
      <p>The St. George Tucker correspondence, though extensive, is
         not the only significant element of the correspondence
         collected here. There is, for example, a voluminous
         correspondence of John Randolph of Roanoke (1773-1833) with
         Randolph and Tucker family members, and members of the Bryan
         family, with whom Randolph had become very close as a
         consequence of his friendship with Joseph Bryan, a Georgia
         congressman who died in 1812. Most of the letters addressed to
         Randolph in this collection were written by his sister-in-law,
         Judith Randolph, whose husband Richard Randolph (Randolph's
         eldest brother) died in 1796, and who relied heavily on
         Randolph for emotional sustenance, financial aid, and advice
         for many years thereafter. Much of Randolph's correspondence
         with his extended family of in-laws, nephews and nieces, and
         with the children of his late friend Bryan, relates to family
         matters and "philosophy of life" expositions. Many of these
         missives run to considerable length.</p>
      <p>There is a scattering of commentary relating to government
         and politics. For example, in a letter to John Coalter (29
         March, 1808) Randolph discussed in detail an aborted treaty of
         amity with England. Other letters which touch on politics are
         found in a copy book of Randolph letters to Francis Walker
         Gilmer for 1818-1826. For example, on Jan. 12, 1821, Randolph
         wrote to Gilmer from Washington that "the want of ability in
         the two houses of Congress (with one or two splendid
         exceptions in the Senate) is ominous. I fear of the future
         fate of our republic--both bodies abound in men of mean
         understandings, &amp; meaner principles &amp; manners. It is
         not possible to conceive of any thing worse &amp; the H of R
         is a bear garden at which one blushes when a stranger
         enters--I endeavor to hold myself entirely aloof from its
         squabbles--for it would be an irony to term them debates." In
         another letter, written at Roanoke on July 22, 1821, Randolph
         had some astringent observations on James Monroe (a former
         political ally) and Monroe's two predecessors in the
         Presidential office. "Mr. J[efferson] himself did much to
         impair the principles upon which he was brought into power,"
         Randolph wrote. "But his successor gave them the
         coup-de-grace--the recommendation of the Bank of the U. S.
         alone was a formal renunciation of the heresies of his
         'Report' and a reconciliation with the holy catholic church of
         Expediency to Existing Circumstances. The present incumbent
         came in upon no particular principles, &amp; as he brought
         none with him so he will carry none away with him." Randolph's
         acerbic style was evident in a letter to Gilmer commenting on
         a speech of "Mr. C." (probably Henry Clay ) in March, 1824.
         "Yesterday," Randolph wrote from Washington on March 9, "he
         came flushed with confidence, made five
         speeches-bad-worse-worst, most worst, worserer, &amp;
         worserest. Had his shallow sophistry &amp; ignorance exposed
         in the most glaring and mortifying manner, &amp; never did I
         behold humiliation &amp; shagrin [sic] more strongly portrayed
         than in his whole countenance &amp; manner--when he was
         outvoted 114-66."</p>
      <p>There are also scattered political comments by Randolph in
         a long series of letters (copies) to Elizabeth Tucker Coalter
         Bryan from 1815-1831. Most comments in these letters, however,
         relate to family life or reflections on life and philosophical
         matters (e.g. the "Worldly" v. the "Romantic," in letter of
         Nov. 20, 1825). Others talk about books (among Randolph's
         favorites was Smollett's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Humphrey Clinker</title>), writers (
         Henry Fielding Randolph calls "the grossest creature
         imaginable"), and Randolph's past relations with his
         correspondent's father, Joseph Bryan (letter of March 27,
         1828). After 1827, his letters took on an increasingly
         melancholy tone, and for long periods he functioned only
         fitfully. See for example letters of October 10, 1828, in
         which he said that drinking was "my chief support," and Nov.
         1, 1828, in which Randolph wrote "I cant read, &amp; writing
         is very trying to me. I lie in bed as much as possible to
         shorten the days. I breakfast about 8 dine a little after 2
         &amp; am abed by 7 O'clock." The letters often refer to death
         and in general evince a jaundiced world view. Randolph was
         sure that the rise of commercial spirit in America was
         corrupting its people, and this outlook only grew more
         pronounced in his later years. (See letters of July 27, 1825,
         Dec. 25, 1828).</p>
      <p>Among the last of the Randolph letters in this collection,
         written less than a year before his death, was penned to his
         godson, J. R. Bryan. It suggests his overall decline. "I am
         put into the Carriage daily &amp; driven a mile or two but I
         am near fainting all the time. I have to be lifted in &amp; I
         cannot walk or even stand without support. This morning at my
         frugal meal of barley water &amp; bread I had nearly fainted
         twice from sheer debility." Randolph died on May 24, 1833, and
         the collection contains a pencil scrawl of his last words, as
         witnessed and attested by Condy Raguet of Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Also included in the collection is the correspondence of
         Elizabeth Tucker Coalter Bryan for 1834-1849, and Nathaniel
         Beverly Tucker to Elizabeth T. Bryan for the period 1825 to
         Tucker's death in 1851. Nearly all of these deal with family
         concerns. There are miscellaneous letters of other Tucker,
         Randolph, and Bryan family members, and miscellany relating to
         John Randolph of Roanoke and Nathaniel Beverly Tucker. This
         includes a collection of anecdotes about Randolph of Roanoke;

         1901, which contains an article on Randolph's mother, Frances
         Bland Randolph. One folder contains a statement by Elizabeth
         Tucker Bryan on Randolph of Roanoke's will. Also in the
         collection are several prints of Randolph, his prayer book, a
         newspaper clipping of a speech made by Nathaniel Beverly
         Tucker at the Southern Convention held in Nashville in 1850 (a
         firebrand speech warning the North to accept slavery expansion
         and the equality of the Southern states or to expect
         secession), and the Emmanuel Church Sunday School Roll Book
         for 1918. Taken as a whole the collection provides much
         material suggestive of plantation life and thought in Virginia
         in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and
         offers insight into the lives and thought of John Randolph of
         Roanoke, St. George Tucker, and Nathaniel Beverly Tucker.</p>
