      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists of about sixty letters from T.S. Eliot, almost exclusively
                through Valerie Fletcher and other secretaries, to Ann Munro-Kerr and the League of
                Dramatists, concerning publishing rights, translations and performances. There are
                three letters signed by Eliot and sent to members of the League of Dramatists and
                one signed letter sent to Rudolfo Usigli (1905-1979), a Mexican playwright.
                There are also six printed items and news clippings.</p>
      <p>All of T.S. Eliot's letters are foldered singly and occur first on the list; next is
                the folder of correspondence from The League of Dramatists to Eliot; followed last
                by the folders of letters written by his secretaries to the League on his behalf,
                including those of his future wife, Valerie Fletcher. The letters written by the
                secretaries are in chronological order.</p>

                            for use in the theatre, since "it appears to be required by a
                            distinguished actor, who, as they say, understands the play."

                            lists the details for all the foreign inquiries that they have received
                            for <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Confidential Clerk,</title>  including
                            France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Scandinavia, and Spain (October 2,

                            amateur company who wanted to perform a part of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">

                            for use in their pageant-history of English Drama; American terms of the
                            renewal of copyright were also discussed (November 5, 1954); and thanks
                            Miss Angela Miles for her letter about the reduced royalties for

                            <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Family Reunion</title> (September 18, 1950);
                            acknowledges that Senor Olivers is the authorized translator of 
                            <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Cocktail Party</title> and the publisher as
                            Emece of Buenos Aires (November 8 and December 21, 1950); Eliot desires
                            to continue his contracts with Suhrkamp Verlag and thinks it best to
                            have two separate contracts for each play in the future, one for book
                            publication and the other for production rights (January 10 and 19,
                            1951); thanks them for the press-cuttings of the Italian production of
                                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Cocktail Party,</title>  as Eliot was
                            interested in the criticisms (January 17, 1951); discusses the offer by
                            Senor Usigli concerning "Spanish language production" (January 19,
                            1951); permission for some Japanese students to give a limited number of
                            performances of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Cocktail Party</title>
                            without any fee (June 5, 1951); encloses three signed copies of 
                            <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Cocktail Party</title> with the authorization
                            form for Mexican copyright and agrees that the new contracts with
                            Suhrkamp Verlag be extended to cover productions in Austria and
                            Switzerland concerning <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Murder in the
                                Cathedral</title> and <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Family
                                Reunion</title> (June 15, 1951); permits three performances of
                                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Murder in the Cathedral</title> by the
                            Musiske Studenter for a nominal fee (October 1, 1951); inquires about
                            the details of his receipts from the publisher Bompiani and Italian
                            productions (October 25, 1951); asks that they grant Senor Francisco
                            Carreres of Valencia the performing rights of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">
                            Murder in the Cathedral</title> under a translation contract
                            (December 20, 1951); Eliot feels that the first option on the rights of
                            his next play should be given to Bonniers of Stockholm (July 8, 1952);
                            Eliot not enthusiastic about a cheap American acting edition of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Cocktail Party</title> (July 14, 1952); refers
                            to the Dutch contract for <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Murder in the
                                Cathedral</title> and forwards criticism of the current translation
                            from Holland (October 7, 1952); Eliot agrees "that 'Guardian Angels' is
                            too precise and limiting a term. He purposely kept a certain ambiguity
                            in the play, and therefore feels that Mr. Leitao ought to be asked to
                            find a more indefinite and less theological term than 'Guardian Angels."
                            (December 8, 1952); instructs them to not renew Pere Boon's license for
                            Murder in the Cathedral but grant them to the other unidentified man
                            (January 28, 1953); discusses the details of the Spanish contract
                            (November 27, 1953); Eliot voices no objections to a single performance
                            of the translation of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Murder in the
                                Cathedral</title> by Mr. Ley's student as long as it doesn't
                            prejudice the use of other translations (April 22, 1954); writes
                            concerning his agreement with Monsieur Morazzani (August 13, 1954); and
                            discusses several letters she sent to The League of Dramatists from the
