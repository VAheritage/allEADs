      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers of Virginius Dabney contain extensive
         correspondence carried on by Dabney as editor of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Richmond Times-Dispatch</title>, in his
         personal life, and as a Pulitzer Prize- winning author. Other
         materials deal with his books such as 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Below the Potomac</title>, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Dry Messiah</title>, and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Liberalism in the South</title>, and
         much useful material collected as research material for these
         books is present. There is extensive material on the American
         Society of Newspaper Editors which Dabney served in various
         capacities including president. A great deal of useful
         material on race relations, African Americans, the N.A.A.C.P.,
         etc., is present. Recent political history of Virginia is
         strongly represented in Dabney's correspondence as editor of
         Virginia's leading newspaper, and in his personal
         correspondence with figures such as Senator A. Willis
         Robinson, Francis Pickens Miller, and Senator Carter
         Glass.</p>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 600 items, 1735-1982,
         papers of the Dabney and related families of Virginia.
         Included in the collection are correspondence, manuscripts of
         books and articles, a diary and a journal, legal papers,
         printed material, memorabilia, and photographs.</p>
      <p>The first series of papers, 1735 and 1790-1918, 269 items,
         includes papers of the Dabney and the related Carr, Davis, and
         Terrell families. The correspondence, 1790-1908, is between
         various members of the Dabney family and their relatives
         concerning various topics. Correspondence of the Davis,
         Terrell, and Carr families, 1790-1892, is primarily Civil War
         correspondence. Pre-Civil War correspondents include Samuel
         Terrell (d. 1798), [Lucy Ann?] Terrell (fl. 1812), Eugene
         Davis (1822-1894), and Lucy Davis (1827-1859). The earliest
         letter, July 7, Kentucky and opportunities there, Indians, and
         a convention to be held in Danville regarding separation of
         the Lower Mississippi Valley from the United States in
         response to the possible ratification of the Jay-Cardoqui
         Treaty (August 29, 1787). Another letter from Lucy Ann Terrell
         to Virginia Terrell, July 18, 1812, concerns the choice of
         "Uncle Carr" as president of the College of William and Mary.
         Another letter, from Lucy Davis to her mother, Mary B.
         Blackford, November 5, 1848, describes in detail the death of
         twenty-three year-old Patsy Davis, wife of Eugene Davis, and
         her burial in the University of Virginia cemetery. Fifteen
         letters in the Carr, Davis, and Terrell correspondence date
         from the Civil War and include letters written by Captain
         Eugene Davis; Mary Jane Terrell Davis (1803-1879), mother of
         Eugene Davis; Richard Terrell Davis (1830-1892), a Confederate
         Eugene Davis; and F.E.G. Carr, lieutenant Commander, Company
         K, 30th Regiment, Virginia Volunteers. Topics mentioned in
         these letters include news of the deaths of acquaintances and
         relatives; family matters; the hiring out of slaves; slaves
         who served as personal servants to men in the army; Captain
         Eugene Davis' command by F.E.G. Carr; the procurement of
         clothes and shoes for soldiers; a Union army charge on Fort
         Harrison; a hasty Confederate retreat following a Union
         attack; desolation around Fredericksburg in 1863; and Henry
         Wise. Several letters mention life in Charlottesville of
         Virginia for the wounded; the use of Alexander Garrett's house
         as a hospital for typhoid patients; and the burial of
         seventy-five dead in a trench outside the University cemetery.
         The post-Civil War letters in the Carr, Davis, and Terrell
         correspondence, 1888-1892, are from A. Moore, Jr., E.W.
         Saunders, and Joseph Bryan to Eugene Davis. The letters from
         Bryan to Davis mention family matters, an invitation to visit
         the Richmond exposition where the Charlottesville Woolen Mills
         had a loom in operation, and an invitation to stay with Bryan
         during the unveiling of the statue of Robert E. Lee in
         Richmond.</p>
      <p>Correspondence of the Dabney family, 1856-1908, follows,
         and includes letters of Virginius Dabney (1835-1894), Maria
         (Heath) Dabney, Dabney's first wife; Elizabeth Anna Heath,
         mother of Maria (Heath) Dabney. Topics discussed in these
         letters include the marriage of Virginius Dabney and Maria
         Heath; their library of over 600 volumes; Dabney's New York
         Latin School; the publication of Virginius Dabney's
