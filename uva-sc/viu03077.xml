      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of twelve items, 1796-1845,
         concerning the Ambler, Carrington, and Minor families. There
         are eleven letters, 1831-1845, from John Barbee Minor to his
         brother, Lucian Minor, and Charles R. Slaughter, as well as a
         bound volume containing manuscript copies of letters,
         1796-1823, from Eliza Jaquelin Ambler to her sister, Ann
         (Ambler) Fisher. Eliza Jacquelin Ambler later married Col.
         Edward Carrington.</p>
      <p>The letterbook labelled "The Carrington Letters, 1796-1823"
         contains manuscript copies of letters, 1780-1823, from Eliza
         Jacquelin Ambler Carrintgon to her sister Ann Ambler Fisher,
         and friends Mildred Dudley and Frances Cairnes. The letters
         contain news of family and friends including Eliza and Ann's
         brother-in-law John Marshall. A scandal involving the
         seduction of family friend Rachel Warrington by the Viscount
         Rochambeau and the U.S. naval career of their son Louis
         [Lewis] Warrington is discussed for forty years. Other topics
         include life in colonial Yorktown, Va., royal governors
         Botetourt and Dunmore, and the siege of Yorktown, flight to
         Winchester, Va., Tarleton's raid, verbal abuse of a family
         slave by visitors from England, a visit to Mt. Vernon shortly
         before George Washington's death, and the decline of the
         Anglican church after the Revolution.</p>
      <p>Following the letters are an introduction and a chapter of
         a proposed novel titled 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Variety, or the Vicissitudes of
         Life</title>begun by Mrs. Carrington "to amuse and instruct"
         the younger members of her sister's family. There is also an
         extract of a letter believed to be written by a sister of
         Chief Justice Marshall, which is followed by a copy of the
         eulogy written by Chief Justice Marshall about his wife.</p>
      <p>John Barbee Minor (1813-1895), the youngest of the nine
         children of Lancelot and Mary Overton (Tompkins) Minor, was
         born in Louisa County, Virginia at "Minor's Folly." He
         attended local schools, and later spent a year at Kenyon
         College, Gambier, Ohio. He entered the University of Virginia
         in 1831, where he graduated in law, and was admitted to the
         bar. He practiced law for six years in Buchanan, Botetourt
         County. He returned to Charlottesville where he continued to
         practice law, until he was appointed to be the fourth
         professor of law at the University of Virginia, where he
         taught for fifty years. Letters from John Barbee Minor are
         written from Kenyon College, and the University of Virginia
         while he attended school there. The letters discuss his
         experiences in college, his candidacy for the legislature, and
         his appointment to the University of Virginia as a professor
         of law in 1845. A letter of September 1845 discusses John
         Minor's thoughts on selling his slave, Lucy, and his desire
         that she be able to stay with her husband, James.</p>
      <p>Lucian Minor (1802-1858) was also born in Louisa County,
         and attended the Nelsons' classical school nearby and later
         taught school. He spent several months during 1823 studying
         law at the College of William and Mary, moved to Alabama
         following graduation, and settled in Louisa County to practice
         law. He was the commonwealth's attorney for the county from
         1828-1852. He became a professor of law at William and Mary in
         1855. He was a temperance advocate and a participant in the
         Virginia prohibitory movement of the 1840s and 1850s. He
         published pamphlets and articles in the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Southern Literary Messenger</title>. He
         married Lavinia Callis Price in 1846; they had four
         children.</p>
