      </p>
      <p>Julia Tyler Wilson was the daughter of Lyon Gardiner Tyler
         and Annie Tucker Tyler. Several members of the Tucker family
         were distinguished lawyers and jurists. St. George Tucker
         (1752-1827) was a Williamsburg lawyer and lieutenant colonel
         in the Revolutionary War. He married Frances Bland, widow of
         John Randolph, and mother of John Randolph of Roanoke, in
         1778. After serving as a professor of law at William and Mary,
         he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Appeals and later to
         a federal judgeship.</p>
      <p>Both of Tucker's sons, Henry St. George and Nathaniel
         Beverley Tucker, pursued legal careers, Henry St. George
         Tucker (1780-1848) studied law at William and Mary and fought
         in the War of 1812. He sat in the United States House of
         Representatives, and later became president of the Virginia
         Supreme Court of Appeals. While a professor of law at the
         University of Virginia, he was instrumental in the
         introduction of the honor system.</p>
      <p>Nathaniel Beverley Tucker (1784-1851), usually referred to
         as Beverley Tucker, also practiced law and fought in the War
         of 1812. A strong advocate of states' rights and secession, he
         was a professor of law at William and Mary.</p>
      <p>St. George Tucker (1828-1863), the son of Henry St. George
         Tucker and Anne Evelina Hunter, studied at the University of
         Virginia and read law with his uncle Nathaniel Beverley Tucker
         at William and Mary. He married Elizabeth Gilmer, daughter of
         Governor Thomas Walker Gilmer, and their daughter Annie Tucker
         Tyler was the mother of Julia Tyler Wilson. He was a clerk in
         the State Senate and House of Representatives, and then opened
         a school in Ashland. While he was serving as a lieutenant in
         the Confederate Army, his health was undermined by exposure.
         He died in Charlottesville in 1863.</p>
      <p>Born at "Sherwood Forest" in Charles City County, Lyon
         Gardiner Tyler (1853-1935) was the son of President John Tyler
         and his second wife Julia Gardiner Tyler. He studied law with
         John B. Minor at the University of Virginia, where he took his
         B.A. and M.A. degrees in 1875 and 1876. He first taught at
         William and Mary and in Memphis, Tennessee, then practiced law
         in Richmond, Virginia from 1882-89. While a member of the
         General Assembly, he was the sponsor of a bill to appropriate
         $10,000 for the reopening of William and Mary, which had been
         forced to close its doors and was asked to serve as President
         of the College from 1888 to 1919, also teaching History and
         Political Economy. An author and historian as well as a
         teacher, he founded and published the

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The James Southall Wilson Collection (#6453-f) consists of
         correspondence and papers ( 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">ca.</title>1100 items) of the Wilson,
         Tyler, Tucker, and Gilmer families, 1781 (1900- 1969). The
         vast majority of the material relates to the personal and
         professional life of noted University teacher, editor, and Poe
         scholar, James Southall Wilson. There are approximately fifty
         pre-1900 letters written by the ancestors of Wilson's wife,
         Julia Tyler Wilson, and a fair amount of correspondence (for
         the years 1876-1935) of her father, Lyon Gardiner Tyler,
         president of the College of William and Mary. This collection
         would be particularly useful to history and English
         scholars.</p>
      <p>In the early correspondence, there are personal letters
         written by Frances Bland Tucker to her husband St. George
         Tucker, Thomas W. Gilmer to his wife Ann, Julia Gardiner Tyler
         to her mother, Henry St. George Tucker to his brother
         Beverley, and two letters concerning politics from John Tyler,
         Jr. to Henry A. Wise. There are several letters from St.
         George Tucker to his wife Elizabeth Gilmer Tucker, describing
         his experiences as a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate
         Army. Lyon Tyler corresponded with his wife, Annie Tucker
         Tyler, his daughter Julia, and son-in-law James Southall
         Wilson, and others, concerning family matters and his academic
         career.</p>
      <p>The James Southall Wilson correspondence is largely between
         members of his immediate family, his wife Julia and two
         daughters Nancy Tucker and Alida, concerning personal and
         professional matters. He corresponded with his University
         colleagues and students and scholars around the country
         including Edwin A. Alderman, J. C. Metcalf, Charlotte Kohler,
         Walter Pritchard Eaton, Stringfellow Barr, Atcheson Hench, and
         Rexmond Cochrane. There are a few letters from people in the
         literary world such as Allen Tate, Julien Green, Carl Van
         Doren, and Emily Clark Balch. The subjects discussed in the
         correspondence are literature, the literary work of Wilson and
         his associates, life at the University of Virginia, the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Quarterly Review</title>, the
         Bread Loaf School of English, and various trips abroad. There
         are many letters of condolence on the deaths of James Southall
         and Julia Tyler Wilson.</p>
      <p>The collection includes a few personal and genealogical
         papers, such as notebooks, school records, certificates, and
         diplomas. There are quite a few photographs of Wilson, his
         family, friends, and colleagues at the University and the
         Bread Loaf School of English. Gertrude Stein appears in one
         group photograph. Newspaper clippings and postcards complete
         the collection.</p>

      <p>The collection arrived at the library in rough
         chronological order. The correspondence has been sorted
         chronologically, the papers alphabetically by topic, the
         photographs chronologically, followed by the postcards, and
         finally the newspaper clippings chronologically.</p>
