      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Chester H. McCall was best known as an Assistant Secretary
         of Commerce under Daniel C. Roper in the first administration
         of Franklin D. Roosevelt. On September 1, 1933, he was
         appointed Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce and placed in
         charge of public relations and publications for the Commerce
         Department. This reflected his early career of journalism in
         Hawaii and on the West Coast. In 1927 he moved east to work
         for Chase Manhattan Bank and then for the American Bankers'
         Association. From there he moved to the National Association
         of Credit Men, where he worked on the national staff and
         edited and published their journal 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Credit and Financial
         Management</title>. In his work at the Commerce Department he
         once again combined his writing skills with his financial and
         business acumen.</p>
      <p>In 1934, McCall founded the National Institute for Public
         Affairs. His work at Commerce expanded to include supervision
         of trade development, business expansion, marketing,
         distribution, and transport of American goods. After a few
         months "on the job," McCall was designated a Special Assistant
         of the Secretary and began directing housing matters for the
         department. He was considered an expert on textile exports and
         was named Secretary to the Cabinet Textile Committee. Because
         of his enthusiastic interest in education and career training,
         McCall was also appointed to the Executive Committee of the
         National Youth Administration.</p>
      <p>In May 1936, McCall left the Commerce Department to
         re-enter the business world. He became the Executive
         Vice-President of the U.S. Advertising Corporation. Very
         little is known of McCall's private or, indeed, his later
         life, save that he was married and had at least two children.
         McCall appears from his writings to have been thoughtful and
         deliberative. He and Secretary Roper attempted to collaborate
         on a book dealing with current economic trends, and he is
         known to have published 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Tested Collection Letters</title>, a
         compendium of types of letters used in business in the
         collection process. His magnum opus, however, was to have been
         a great work on democracy, tracing the philosophy from its
         earliest roots to the dangers it faced in the rise of
         totalitarianism in the 1930s. Research and drafts of parts of
         several chapters make up much of the collection.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection contains 440 items, 1932-1937, pertaining to
         Chester H. McCall's work for the National Association of
         Credit Men, the Commerce Department, and his proposed books
         and articles, including many newspaper articles. Some of
         McCall's personal letters (Box 1, Commerce Department:
         Personal) and notes for several chapters reflect his thinking
         on citizenship in a democracy, the dangers democracies have
         always faced, his views on the high calling of public service,
         and his personal goals for service. The collection as a whole
         incidentally shows the tremendous intellectual ferment of the
         1930s as the grim economic picture raised fundamental
         questions about society and the human condition.</p>
