      <p>Jacques Nicolas Colbert ("James Nicholas Colbert"), born in
         Paris in 1655, was the second son of Jean-Baptist Colbert
         (1619-1683), Louis XIV's chief advisor and government
         administrator. He was archbishop of Rouen from 1691 until his
         death in 1707. 
         <emph render="super">1</emph></p>
      <p>Daniel de Cosnac, born in 1627 or 1630 at his family's
         chateau in Limousin, was the youngest son of Baron Cosnac. His
         father intended him for a church career and Cosnac was sent to
         the household of Francois- Louis de Bourbon, prince de Conti
         (1664-1709), and became a favorite of the Duchess of
         Longueville (Anne-Genevi&amp;#36261; de
         Bourbon-Cond&amp;#39532; and later, the prince himself. He
         gained influence over the prince but at the conclusion of the
         Fronde, Cosnac persuaded the prince to reconcile with the
         royal court while Louis de Bourbon, prince de
         Cond&amp;#39712;military leader of the forces against the
         king, offered his services to Spain, France's chief enemy. 
         <emph render="super">2</emph></p>
      <p>Seventeenth century France experienced severe religious
         persecutions and civil war. The First Fronde (1648-1649), was
         a rebellion of the middle class and nobility in opposition to
         higher taxes and suspension of interest payments on state
         bonds ordered by Cardinal Jules Mazarin (1602-1661), the
         king's chief political, spiritual and intellectual advisor and
         administrator. [Frondes were slings used by Paris criminals.]
         Such was the turmoil caused by the Fronde that Louis XIV and
         the royal family fled Paris and remained away from the capital
         for nearly a year. 
         <emph render="super">3</emph></p>
      <p>Cosnac became first chaplain to Monsieur, Philippe, duc
         d'Anjou and later, duc d'Orl&amp;#39022;s (1640-1701), the
         king's brother. Thanks to the influence of Prince Conti,
         Cosnac was appointed bishop of Valence in 1654 although he had
         not been formally admitted to holy orders (nor was even a
         sub-deacon). Nevertheless, Cosnac stood high in Philippe's
         favor and became his chaplain in 1658. Following a quarrel
         with the Chevalier de Lorraine (Philippe de Lorraine-Armagnac)
         caused in part because Cosnac sided with Madame (the
         Monsieur's wife), Philippe ordered him to leave Paris; however
         Madame used her influence to effect his return. Cosnac was
         later accused of being a counterfeiter, arrested and tried by
         a bishop's tribunal which exiled and confined him at
         L'Ile-Jourdain [a small village in Armagnac; later the chief
         town of the canton of the department of Gers] for thirty-two
         months (1670-1672). Louis evidently did not hold this against
         him, for he later gave Cosnac opportunities to demonstrate his
         loyalty to the crown.</p>
      <p>Three years later Cosnac was appointed archbishop of Aix.
         He proved zealous on the crown's behalf as a member of several
         general assemblies of clergy (1655-1657, 1665-1666, 1681-1682,
         1685, 1690, 1695, 1701, 1707) and was a signatory of the
         Declaration of the Four Articles, sometimes known as the Four
         Gallican Articles of 1682. The first of the Articles
         reaffirmed the overall authority of the king; the second,
         third and fourth articles rejected the supremacy of the papacy
         and held that the final authority over religion in France
         rested with the Assembly of Clergy and the king
         ("Gallicianism"). The pope (Innocent X; reigned 1676-1689) was
         declared to have but limited control over the Gallican
         (French) Church. 
         <emph render="super">4</emph></p>
      <p>The persecution of French Protestants (Huguenots) became
         state policy in October 1685 when Louis XIV revoked the Edict
         of Nantes (1598) which had guaranteed state toleration of
         Huguenots (his act was known as the Revocation). During this
         period Cosnac, as head of a commission on religious affairs
         and a spokesman for French Catholic clergy, publicly joined
         the defense of the liberties of the French Church and
         vigorously persecuted Protestants in his diocese. He was
         called to the bishopric of Aix in 1687 but did not officially
         take possession of his see until 1695. He died at
         Aix-en-Provence on 18 January 1708. A contemporary, Louis de
         Rouvroy, second duc d'Saint-Simon (1675-1758), described him
         as a man of intelligence, justice, vivacity and
         resourcefulness, but also a fearsome, ambitious intriguer.
         Cosnac's two volume Memoires, written with humor and eccentric
         details of the author's intrigues, were not published until
         the summer of 1852 by his descendant, Gabriel Jules, Comte de
         Cosnac (1819-1893), for the Society of the History of France.

         religious affairs during the reign of Louis XIV (born 1638;
         reigned 1643-1715). Also present is a similarly entitled "A

         the Session, and taking leave of his Majesty." The manuscript
         closes with "A Panegyric made some years since on the Dauphin
         of France," post 1711.</p>

        <p>These lengthy orations primarily praise Louis XIV as the
            greatest king on earth, defender of France and the true
            Catholic Church, and urge religious unity. Colbert hails
            Louis as a powerful, merciful genius who "can pour out your
            Thunder beyond the Bounds of Africa." French Protestants
            (Huguenots) are characterized as instigators of domestic
            strife and urged to be loyal Frenchmen by rejecting
            Protestantism. Cosnac accuses them of violating the laws
            and practicing heresy. He also urges Louis to offer
            military assistance to James II of England [reigned
            1685-1688] to restore Catholicism in that kingdom. These
            speeches are typical of various general religious
            assemblies held in France during the seventeenth century
            which tended to agreed unanimously on the issues of the day
            and not dispute the king.</p>
        <p>The unidentified speaker of the panegyric, post 1711,
            eulogizes the Grand Dauphin [title of the official heir to
            the French throne], Louis de France (1661-1711). As Louis
            XIV's son and intended heir, he was usually addressed as
            Monseigneur and died on April 12, 1711. The speaker
            identifies the Dauphin's godfather as Pope Clement IX
            (reigned 1667-1670) and the date of his christening as
            August 24, 1668. The Dauphin is portrayed as first among
            men, a man of virtue and merit, and a brave, skillful
            soldier. [According to the Library of Congress, Louis de
            France (1682-1712) was the son of the Grand Dauphin Louis
            (1661-1711). It is possible this panegyric has them
            confused.] 
            <emph render="super">1</emph></p>
        <p>The volume concludes with a postscript statement (whose
            ink color and handwriting suggests it was written some time
            after the transcript of the two speeches) praising Cosnac
            and the French effort to exterminate the heresy of
            Calvinism. Its tone indicates the possibility that this
            entire volume was some form of notebook or intended book or
            pamphlet manuscript originally preserved by an English
            Catholic and supporter of King James II (deposed in the
            "Glorious Revolution of 1688"; died 1701) and later, his
            son, the Prince of Wales, James Edward Stuart (styled by
            his supporters as "James III" and his detractors as "the
            Old Pretender").</p>
        <p>In 1651 the bishop of Cummings pleaded with Louis XIV
            not to plunge France into a campaign of religious
            persecution by restricting the rights of its Protestants;
            the bishops of Orleans and Grenoble publicly opposed
            anti-Protestant measures. But between 1662 and 1684
            Catholics were given control of Protestant cemeteries,
            Protestant funerals were forbidden in the daytime,
            marriages between Protestants and Catholics were banned,
            Protestant churches closed, and Protestants barred from
            many professional and public occupations, including
            appointments to royal service. 
            <emph render="super">2</emph></p>
        <p><emph render="super">1</emph>A probable historical
            explanation of the panegyric: In a limited extent, Cosnac's
            and Colbert's orations could be considered rebuttals of
            Michel de L'Hospital (1503- 1573), Chancellor of France and
            a proponent of religious coexistence. In a speech before
            the Estates General meeting at Saint-Germain and later, in
            the Colloquy of Poissy (1561), he argued for tolerant
            coexistence between Catholics and Protestants to maintain
            internal political stability and for the good of the king
            (Louis XIII), his subjects, Christianity, and civic peace
            in France. L'Hospital was a politique, a person who,
            despite his own religious convictions (L'Hospital was
            Catholic) and impelled by secular and temporal motives,
            "put the interests of the State above all else and was
            willing to make compromises to preserve its security and
