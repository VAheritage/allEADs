                  poet who, declaring himself a 'worker,' has applied
                  to him for aid." About vulgarity, Beerbohm writes,
                  "Vulgarity has its uses. Vulgarity often cuts ice
                  which refinement scrapes at vainly. And I like to
                  think that some of the Labor leaders who have read
                  J.Q.X. 's account of my shocking little drawing will
                  visit the Leicester Galleries and be shocked
                  themselves -- shocked even into realizing, as they do

                  <p>Galvez fought against the Apaches in 1763 on the

                  handling of border incidents with Great Britain along
                  the Mississippi. In 1779, on the outbreak of war with
                  Great Britain, he was promoted to Brigadier-General
                  and Governor, capturing Fort Manchak, Baton Rouge,
                  and Mobile by 1780. In 1781, his conquest of

                  <p>Gissing mentions the return of his wife, Nell, his
                  lack of leisure to spend in writing a second book,
                  and the dangers of procrastination (1881);
                  congratulates his brother on the completion of his
                  examination, his wife determined to return to Soho
                  Square to live, is busy writing his last will and
                  testament, and reading about Italy (1882 May);
                  Helen's arm to be operated upon, asks about an
                  edition of Byron without 
                  <title render="italic">Don Juan</title>, and plans to
                  send his paper on pessimism (1882 Nov 5); his wife
                  has gone to live in [Brinton ?], taking half of their
                  furniture, hopes to have another novel finished by
                  midsummer, and he pays Nell a pound weekly (1882 Dec
                  27); advocates learning to read German, recommending 
                  <title render="italic">Goethe</title>by Lewes, and
                  the essays by Thomas Carlyle about Goethe, and his
                  purchase of engravings by Raphael (1884 Sep 18); gas
                  explosion on the ground floor of his building, Jean
                  Ganssen now staying with him, discusses Buchanan's 
                  <title render="italic">In Stormy Waters</title>, "It
                  puzzles me how a man capable of fairly good work can
                  condescend to the most amazing trash in this way,"
                  and says that the third volume of his novel advances
                  (1885 Feb 28); praises George Meredith's 
                  <title render="italic">Diana of the
                  Crossways</title>as Shakespeare in modern English
                  (1885 Apr 29); recasting his novel [ 
                  <title render="italic">Isabel Clarendon</title>] into
                  two volumes, enjoying the Reminiscences of Crabb
                  Robinson, and is spending about eight hours a day
                  writing (1885 Aug 5); has a check for

                  <p>Law came to America in 1794, when 35 years old and
                  had distinguished himself in India. He settled in
                  Washington City, prospered and married Elizabeth
                  Parke Custis, a grand daughter of Martha Washington.
                  He came in contact with most of the prominent men of
                  his time, including presidents. Thus the letters
                  contain much information about the growth of the
                  United States and the capitol, politics, the War of
                  1812, anti-Jackson sentiment, trips to springs in
                  Virginia, a visit to the University of Virginia, the
                  death of Judge Selden in a duel, affairs in India,
                  and much personal news. Many of these letters are
                  addressed to his sister, Joanna, who married Sir
                  Thomas Rumbold, a prominent East India Company
                  official;

                  <p>Dolley writes chiefly to her sister, Anna Payne
                  Cutts, and cousins, Mrs. Van Zandt and Mrs. L. Henry
                  Cutts, but also to Richard Smith and Mrs. Thornton,
                  primarily concerning family matters, but also: wigs
                  (n.y. Aug 2); difficulties in reaching Montpelier
                  because of bad roads and swollen rivers (n.y. May
                  13); a letter from Thomas Jefferson about the death
                  of Maria and the deep grief of the family (1804 Apr
                  26); and the delicate health of James Madison ([1805]
                  Jul 29). 
                  <lb/>
                     <lb/>Dolley also writes concerning problems with her
                  knee and her memory of the Society of Friends, "our
                  Society used to control me entirely and debar me from
                  so many advantages and pleasures, and tho so entirely
                  from their clutches, I really felt my ancient terror
                  of them revive to disagreeable degree." ([1805] Aug
                  19); Madison going to the office though ill with a
                  cold; Thomas Jefferson has a sick headache every day;
                  Colonel Aaron Burr on the way to Richmond for trial
                  ([1807] Mar 27); marriage of sister Lucy Payne
                  Washington and Supreme Court Judge Thomas Todd of
                  Kentucky; Federalists refuse to enter the Madison's
                  doors ([1812] Mar 20); disappointed in her desire to
                  see Payne at Montpelier; and the affairs of her
                  brother-in-law John George Jackson (1830 Jan 25). 
                  <lb/>
                     <lb/>Other topics include: gift of a scarf; the
                  inflammation of her eyes (1838 Oct 8); intense
                  concern for her sister's health (n.y. May 18);
                  trouble with her knee keeping the family from
                  returning to Orange; regrets not being able to nurse
                  her through this childbirth; anxious to place Payne
                  at Baltimore in the fall (n.y. Jul 8); urges her
                  sister to visit and sends money for Payne to come
                  home (Friday); Madison confined to bed though in
                  constant receipt of visitors and mail; receipt of the

                  Philadelphia at the U.S. Constitutional Convention,
                  whose most prevalent idea is a total change in the

                  upon the principles of equal proportionate
                  representation consisting of two branches of the
                  Legislature, and making the state legislatures
                  subordinate to the national, establishing a national
                  executive, and a judiciary system. He also appends a
                  list of Amendments to the Confederation under
                  consideration.

                  a French medical student, Armand Lement, to accompany

                  no objection. Gallatin was in Great Britain
                  negotiating a commercial treaty for President Madison

                  Newfoundland and the Colony of Virginia. Reade
                  (1657-1723) began his account of his first voyage in
                  1674, when he sailed as a physician and surgeon in
                  chief, on a merchant vessel commanded by Captain
                  Stoplen Pain. He furnishes much information about the
                  fishing trade, crops, planters, diseases, flora and
                  natural features of Newfoundland. 
                  <lb/>
                     <lb/>He undertook another voyage with Captain

                  and the habits and characteristics of the snake, much

                  <p>Anderson was a native of New Kent County,
                  Virginia, presently Hanover County, who operated a
                  store and a plantation, and served as a factor for
                  several British merchants. Until 1700, Anderson was
                  jointly concerned with Cuthbert Jones and Samuel
                  Clarke, of England, in the operation of the store and
                  in the purchasing of tobacco in Virginia. After 1700,
                  Jones continued to consign European goods to Anderson
                  and to order annual purchases of tobacco.
                  Occasionally, John Page and Richard Lee also used
                  Anderson as their factor. Anderson consigned his own
                  tobacco harvests to Page, Lee, John Gibson, or John
                  Lane. In 1713, he was appointed an executor in the
                  estate of John Page, which brought him into
                  association with Micajah and Richard Perry. 
                  <lb/>
                     <lb/>All of these activities are reflected in his
                  letters, as well as revealing information about the
                  Virginia economy, annual tobacco prices, rates of
                  exchange, shipping rates, annual crop conditions,
                  store keeping, and his duties as a Virginia factor
                  for British firms. The letterbook also contains a
                  small group of letters, 1715-1717, pertaining to the
                  executors settlement of his estate. #

                  <p>The first orderly book is that of the artillery
                  corps, from Winchester, and the first eleven pages
                  were written by the commander Major James Faulkner
                  with the remainder in the handwriting of his
                  sergeants. It records the events of the march to
                  Norfolk, the organization of the artillery under
                  Colonel Read, and all the General, Brigade, and
                  Regimental orders to June 17, 1813, when Major
                  Faulkner was ordered to Craney Island. At the end is
                  a note by Charles J. Faulkner about the finding of
                  the book. The second orderly book was that of Elisha
                  Boyd, Lt. Colonel of the 4th Regiment of Virginia
                  Militia, and father-in-law of the first Charles James
                  Faulkner, covering May 3 to August 1, 1814, when
                  Washington was threatened by Cockburn and the
                  defenses of Norfolk were strengthened. On July 22 an
                  attack was repulsed and dead buried. It also records
                  courts-martial, punishments, and all the general,

                  <p>Eden begins with his service in 1785 as a
                  Captain's servant and continues through the
                  Napoleonic Wars. It contains accounts of all ships on
                  which he sailed, admirals under whom he served,
                  including Hyde Parker and Horatio Nelson, actions in
                  which he was engaged and enemy ships captured. He
                  describes the battle of Copenhagen, sieges of Malta
                  and Flushing and action at Naples. There are personal
                  notes on health and travels, and observations on the
                  British custom of requiring other ships to salute her
                  colors. With the memoirs are a letter granting
                  permission to publish, 1823; a letter, 1793, as a
                  midshipman, relating an encounter with the French
                  fleet with a sketch of the ships' positions; and a
                  letter, 1778, from Charles Henri, Comte d'Estaing, to
                  Louis Antoine de Bougainville on naval matters.
