      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>Nelson Noland</persname></p>
      <p>An early letter, undated but written on the reverse side of
         a note from Mr. Morrison of 
         <corpname>Rugby Academy</corpname>which was dated February 11,
         1851, speaks of the sale of stock, crops, farming implements
         and slaves, excluding the "best behaved" slaves, from both
         plantations, [ 
         <corpname>Dewberry</corpname>?] and [ 
         <corpname>Endfield</corpname>?]. In the fall of 1861, Nelson
         attended a school in 
         <geogname>Richmond, Virginia</geogname>, run by 
         <persname>Heath J. Christian</persname>. Most of the letters
         to Nelson were written to him from his mother and father, and
         brother Frank, while he was away at school, first at
         Christian's and then at the 
         <corpname>Virginia Military Institute</corpname>, which he
         entered in August of 1863. These letters contain news of life
         and events during the Civil War. Nelson's father, 
         <persname>Callender St. George Noland</persname>, served as
         Commandant of the battery at 
         <geogname>Mulberry Island Point</geogname>defending the 
         <geogname>James River</geogname>. In his letter January 12,
         1862, 
         <persname>Callender Noland</persname>mentions receiving three
         dispatches telling him to look for the enemy, who he wishes
         would come up and fight or else go on out to sea, and being on
         board one of the two steamers stationed near the battery to
         protect the 
         <geogname>James River</geogname>.</p>
      <p>Other letters to Nelson mention: selling barrels of corn
         and stacks of fodder to the Quartermaster (January 16, 1862);

         position of assistant surgeon under Dr. Wiley in the 
         <corpname>Confederate Army</corpname>and several social
         gatherings involving General Pendleton's staff and Captain
         Kirkpatrick's Company, and the presence of General [Stuart] at
         the wedding of Dr. Fontaine after a ride of forty miles
         (February 14, 1863); and the progress of Nelson at school and
         his hopes of entering 
         <corpname>Virginia Military Institute</corpname>(August 1,
         1863).</p>

         <persname>Walter Cope</persname>, and
