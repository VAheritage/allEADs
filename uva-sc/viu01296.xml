         <p>Sommerville first attended the University of Pennsylvania
         medical school in 1859 and returned there following the war.
         During the war he returned to Virginia and served as a
         Confederate surgeon in a hospital at Liberty (now Bedford),
         Virginia. He married Fannie Meriwether of Bedford County in
         1865; they had children, Elizabeth and Frank Meriwether. In
         1899, he married Philippa Randolph; they had children, Susie
         Randolph and Mary Beverley.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>In a letter, ca. 1861, Sommerville's sister, Louisa, writes
         from Romney, Hampshire County, Virginia (West Virginia),
         concerning the excitement and confusion around the locality,
         rumors of the Yankees being in Romney, and the rumor that
         Sommerville is for the Union following his negative talk upon
         returning from Moorefield, and making disparaging remarks
         about the Union, Abraham Lincoln, and the local Union men. On
         September 25, [1863], Molly writes from Front Royal, Virginia,
         mentioning the sacramental meeting held by the Presbyterians
         and news of the war, including talk of victory in the west,
         the good news from a minister that Charleston, South Carolina
         cannot be taken, that the Yankees are no closer than
         Martinsburg, and that from ten to fifteen deserters from the
         Yankee army come through everyday. She also encourages him to
         make the acquaintance of H. S. Taylor of Westmoreland. A
         November 8, 1863 letter from "Castalia," Albemarle County,
         Virginia contains comments on Southern literature and
         literature in general, and mentions current works of persons
         such as Victor Hugo, Edward Robert Bulwer, Earl of Lytton, [ ]
         McCauley, and [ ] Harrison. The writer of the letter is
         apparently tutoring students at the small school of Mr.
         [Robert Walker] Lewis at "Castalia," and writes that he is
         busy with several music scholars and extra French scholars as
         well as his own studies in German. He also mentions that the
         Yankee raiders have disappeared from the area. On October 2,
         1865, W. T. Pryor of Evergreen, [Alabama,] writes about the
         location at Union Depot being overstocked with physicians, the
         growth and sale of crops of cotton, corn, and potatoes, the
         M[obile] and O[hio] Railroad cars running daily, and news of
         family and friends. There is also a letter, February 18, 1880,
         from Sommerville at White Post, Clarke County, Virginia, to a
         delegate in Charlestown, West Virginia, discussing the terms
         for the donation of property to be used by the S[henandoah]
         V[alley] Railroad.</p>
