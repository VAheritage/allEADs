      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection consists of fourteen letters, 1861-1864, to Sally Magruder Warren from her brothers-- James W. Magruder, David Magruder and George S. Magruder--all of whom were Confederate soldiers from
Virginia. Two of her brothers, Hillery and James, were killed in the Civil War. One letter in 1861 appears to be from Sally's father--James Magruder--concerning some business affairs of Hillery.
</p>
      <p>On February 25, 1861, James Magruder writes from Union Mills, [Virginia]to "My Dear Sir" in reference to a contract with Hillery concerning his practice as a new physician.
</p>
      <p>October 23, 1861, David writes from "at home" to Sally about the "slow healing" of a wound and says that "Sis Florence" is now tending him since Hillery's departure. He writes that "Father and George" brought
news of a grand victory [Ball's Bluff] at Leesburg in which "2500 of our men whipped 10,000 or 12,000 of the enemy."
</p>
      <p>November 12, 1861--from Leesburg, Virginia--James tells Sally he has recovered from a severe attack of influenza and is "as homesick and low spirited an individual as can be found." He thinks the war "will ruin
the whole country as it has gotten to be a question of endurance, not of valor, and the North, I fear, has the advantage of us in that respect." He comments on David's slow recovery and fears Hillery may have been
killed as he has not heard from him--needs new boots and flannel for undershirts.
</p>
      <p>January 25, 1862--Leesburg, Virginia--James has been promoted from Corporal to Sergeant but believes he will have to stay in the service until war's end; is very concerned about father growing old without the
business assistance he needs.
</p>
      <p>October 6, 1863--Camp near Orange Springs--James tells Sally he hears that Edward writes that conditions are bad at Charleston and wants to know if Sally has written Edward of Hillery's death and reflects upon
Hillery's life and the mysteries of life and death.
</p>
      <p>November 3, 1863--Camp Wellford's Farm--James writes Sally he has visited George (who is well except for boils) and expects a visit from David; mentions that Col. [W.] and men, who have been at Brandy Station,
are making preparations for winter by building huts; mentions that several days previously his unit was ordered to go on a raid, but went instead to Kelly's Ford before returning the next day.
</p>
      <p>November 17, 1863, from Headquarters 3rd Artillery Corps near Orange Court House--David reports to Sally that the whole army has fallen back from Culpeper and occupies much the same position it had before the
advance; says he is "so tired of war" but believes in the fighting; comments on what Ashby and Stonewall Jackson "the noblest Roman of them all" would arise and say--"heaven forbid, we should not grumble, for it
is God's will thus to punish us for our sinful ways and he will end it in his own good time"; thinks the current course of the war might be different if Jackson had not been killed, but thinks God "took him from
us for we were bringing ourselves to almost worshiping him."
</p>
      <p>Dec 7, 1863--Camp Twyman's Farm--James writes Sally he has been involved in General [Meade's] late demonstration on the lower Rapidan, "we had some fifteen or so men wounded in the [thing], none killed"; has
heard that Colonel Edward Tiffin Harrison Warren is safe and in command of Brig. Gen. George H. Steuart's Brigade as Steuart was wounded; writes he has been picketing near Madison Court House.
</p>
      <p>January 6, 1864--[Frescati]--James, who apparently is at home, writes family news to his sister.
</p>
      <p>March 18, 1864--Camp Montpelier--James describes departure of George and says father has received letter from Edward from Appling County, Georgia which says he will not come home on furlough. A letter written
March 29, 1864, to "Sis" from Camp Montpelier is faded and illegible.
</p>
      <p>June 3, 1864--from "In Line of Battle 9 miles from Richmond"--this is an anguished letter from George to Sally in which he attempts to console her on the deaths of Colonel Warren and two of their brothers.
George writes that he himself expects to be killed and despite the fact that he probably will be buried on the battlefield, wishes he could be laid with "Hillery and Jim" in the family graveyard. He says "I am
very unprepared to die but I would rather die a thousand deaths on the field than live to see a Negro guard posted by your door." He concludes by saying--"I cannot write more as the balls are flying all around me
and a man has just been wounded in a few feet of me."
</p>
      <p>September 18, 1864--Co. C., 13th Virginia Infantry, Pegram's Brigade, Ramseur's Division, Army of the Valley--George tells Sally he is in camp on the Berryville Pike about a mile from Winchester. He reports
many of the men make frequent trips to town for diversion, but he himself has not. He pleads for delivery of some new pants, details what he knows of Confederate troop movements, laments the loss of Confederate
leaders--Morgan [ ], John Daniel Imboden, and John Singleton Mosby--and writes "I fear the spirits of the army here are not very good--the clouds which hang over our history as a people seem indeed to be darkening
and gradually closing in around us. I don't think our chances for independence were ever so dark before since the war."
</p>
      <p>April 8 [ 1864? ]--from [Frascati]--George inquires of Sally if she knows the whereabouts of any of Hillery's papers dealing with an account which Lt. P.P. Kennon of his company refuses to pay. He also requests
Sally to send to their father resolutions passed by Hillery's company in his honor as he wishes to have them published in the Richmond papers; expects a "grand row with Grant in a few days."
</p>
      <p>September 6 [1864? ]--from near Stephenson's Depot, Camp of the 18th Virginia Infantry--George discusses Cupid and Hornet (apparently two of his ponies) and says he is glad Cousin Jennie has taken good care of
Hornet. He writes "No news from this army. We are marching around after them every day but can't get a fight out of them."
