      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This farm journal belonged to Robert Thruston Hubard
         (1808-1871) of "Chellowe," Buckingham County, Virginia, and
         includes farm accounts from September 26, 1835 to December
         1846. The journal contains clear and very detailed accounts of
         tobacco and wheat farming expenses and receipts as well as
         personal and family expenses. At one point in the journal,
         Hubard stops to commend to his sons and every man his practice
         of keeping a "register of receipts and payments" for his own
         economic health (1841 Dec 5; 1846 Dec).</p>
      <p>The first page of the journal begins with a memorandum
         concerning the administration of the estate of Hubard's
         mother, by his brother, Edmund W. Hubard which lasted until
         January 1, 1835. As part of the settlement of his mother's
         estate, Robert T. Hubard had received a tract of mountainous
         land called the Tye River tract which he sold to William
         Harvey on September 26, 1835 (see second entry in
         journal).</p>
      <p>Near the back of the journal are two inventories of slaves
         with notes on births and deaths called "Names of Negroes owned
         by Robert T. Hubard in Nelson in 1837, with their ages
         ascertained to the fall of 1837" and "Names of Negroes owned
         by Robert T. Hubard in Buckingham in 1837, with their ages
         ascertained to the fall of 1837."</p>
      <p>Another reference to named slaves includes the murder of
         "Joe" (age 24) by the "other Joe" (age 24), who was condemned
         to death by the Nelson County Court and then pardoned by
         Governor Gilmer, who sent him out of the United States instead
         of having him hung (1841 Sep 28). Hubard also refers to the
         purchase of a male slave, George, "at Maysville under
         execution" from the sheriff of Buckingham County (1842 Jan
         10). Hubard also refers to expenses related to his service in
         the Virginia House of Delegates.</p>
      <p>Another topic of interest is a penciled account in a
         different hand of political controversy over activities at the
         Republican state and national conventions in 1896 to control
         the state chairman and deprive the minority delegates of their
         right to participate. The author writes an eleven page
         description of how one faction refused to recognize the
         Virginia state chairman, Colonel [William ?] Lamb (1835-1905)
         of Norfolk, chosen by the convention and their mistreatment of
         him at St. Louis. Other individuals mentioned in this attempt
         to remove Lamb from the chairmanship of the party include
         Edmund Waddill, Jr. (1855-1931) and Park Agnew (1847-?) of
         Alexandria, who became state Republican Chairman in 1900.</p>
      <p>The journal records Hubard's expenses for a trip with his
         family to the White Sulphur Springs and Hot Springs (1839 Sep
         11), where he includes his comments about the springs, "that
         sink hole of extravagance, gambling and vice for many young
         and unmarried men" . . . "If either of my sons should after or
         before my death visit the Virginia springs, for health and I
         hope they will never go for any other purpose, may heaven in
         its mercy guard &amp; defend them from all the evil, the
         seduction &amp; corrupting influences of those dull,
         disagreeable and dangerous places."</p>
      <p>Hubard gives additional advice about debt and economy at
         the end of his account of the expenses involved in remodeling
         his house (1837, at the end of his regular accounts), followed
         by several pork and agricultural memoranda concerning the
         "Rosny Estate," his wife's property after the death of her
         father in January 1835, and the "Tye River Estate," in Nelson
         County.</p>
