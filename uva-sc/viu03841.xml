</head>
         <p>The James De Ruyter Blackwell collection consists of 275 items, ca. 1860-1900, primarily autograph poems written by Blackwell. Blackwell, born in Fauquier County, Virginia, in 1828, originally studied law and
was admitted to the bar in 1860. He later taught at the Bethel Classical and Military Academy. Having been both a lawyer and a teacher, he settled into his third, and final, vocation as a poet. Two volumes of his
poetry were published, one in 1879 and the other in 1884, under the title, <title render="italic">The Poetical Works of James De Ruyter Blackwell</title>. Many of his poems concern his native state where he lived
until his death in 1901.

         <head>Arrangement
</head>
         <p>The poems in this collection are organized alphabetically by title, or by first line in cases where there is no title. Some of the manuscripts were numbered by Blackwell, but this apparent pagination was not
considered in the final order. The last two folders contain essays and a bill, and a verse play.
