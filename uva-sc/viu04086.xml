</head>
      <p>The Henkel family of New Market, Virginia, operated the Henkel printing press which
                became the most important bilingual printing establishment for German Lutherans in
                the states of Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina during the nineteenth century.
                Paul Henkel (1754-1825) was an itinerate Lutheran preacher involved with
                various synods in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Maryland and North Carolina.
                Solomon David Henkel (1777-1847), Paul's son, was a physician, teacher and
                head of the Henkel Press along with his brother, Ambrose (1786-1870). Andrew
                Henkel (1790-1870), was also the son of Paul Henkel as well as an itinerate
                preacher and educator. Samuel G. Henkel (1807-1863), was the son of Solomon
                and continued running the press after his father's death.</p>
      <p>For more information concerning the contributions of the Henkel family to the
                printing of religious works and preaching in the Lutheran Church, consult Klaus

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection contains 606 items contained in 5 Hollinger boxes (2.5 linear feet)
                concerning the Henkel Family of Shenandoah and the operation of the Henkel Press in
                New Market, Virginia. The dates of the materials range from 1793-1910, with
                the bulk of the material coming from the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>
      <p>The journals of Paul Henkel give a history of his travels and family as well as the
                history of the Shenandoah Valley. The journals also are a depiction of parts of
                Pennsylvania, Maryland, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Ohio that interacted with the
                Shenandoah Valley. Many of these journals along with Paul Henkel's correspondence
                were used by Dr. William J. Finck to write the "Chronological Life of Paul Henkel"
                (MSS 2827).</p>
      <p>Solomon D. Henkel is the chief recipient of the correspondence as he, along with his
                brother, Ambrose, is the head of the press. He also served as the postmaster of New
                Market, physician and educator. The correspondence covers a variety of subjects
                concerning Solomon's multiple expertise. He does not only receive letters concerning
                his own business, but also in regard to the business of others due to his position
                as postmaster. The collection is invaluable as a source of information on the Henkel
                Family, the starting and operation of the press, the decline of German as a
                prominent language in the Shenandoah Valley, and the activities of Lutheran
                Preachers during this period. Many of the Henkels' business contacts were also
                personal friends so the letters include aspects of daily life as well as the
                logistical matters of the business.</p>
      <p>Much of the later material in the collection is the correspondence, both to and from,
                Samuel G. Henkel, Solomon's son. Samuel's memorandum books are also a tremendous
                source of logistical information especially as it pertains to the history of
                commercial imports to the Winchester Millers and the New Market Henkels from New
                York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Alexandria. Information includes names of
                merchants, locals, printing, medicines, books, etc.</p>
      <p>Some items of interest are the correspondence of John Barnett (1814-1819)
                which concerns a variety of subjects, including the treatment of maladies, crop
                prices and book sales; a series of letters from the War of 1812, including a discussion of the moral implications of military service, conditions at Camp Crossroads and the defense of Baltimore particularly the battle of North Point and the bombardment of Ft. McHenry where the writer, William Warner, noted "naught could be seen but the light of Rockets and the bursting of Bombs thrown from their shipping at our fort...."; a letter from Jacob Woltz of February 9, 1811 concerning retribution against slaves that killed their
                masters; the correspondence of Warner and Schaeffer from Baltimore, March 26, 1813,
                who must take into account the positions of British troops when shipping goods to
                New Market. The two letters of Gideon Jones from November 1818 describe relations
                with the Cherokees of Georgia, the Secret Green Corn Dance, and the African slaves
                of the Native Americans.</p>

      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The collection is arranged in three series topically, alphabetically and
                chronologically. The manuscripts for publication are organized alphabetically by
                title. Series I is correspondence of the Henkel Press, Series II is the
                correspondence of the Henkel Family and other items of historical importance, and
                Series III is manuscripts intended for publication. Boxes 1 and 2 contain
                correspondence, primarily letters addressed to Solomon or Ambrose Henkel or to the
                Henkel Press in general. Boxes 3 and 4 contain other historical resources on the
                Henkel Press including historical notes by a later hand and the journals and
                memoranda books of the Henkels. Box 5 contains the remainder of the journals and
                memorandum books as well as manuscripts for items that might have been meant for
                publication.</p>
