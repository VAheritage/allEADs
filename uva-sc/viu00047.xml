      <p>Letters dated 20, 25 April 1866; 10 July 1868; and 3 Sept
         1869 concern debts and taxes on the estate of

      <p>Two small notebooks dating from 1862 and 1863 are among the
         bound volumes in Box 1. These consist of notes taken by 
         <persname>Charles G. Alexander</persname>during his period as
         a member of the 
         <corpname>15th Regiment of the Virginia Cavalry</corpname>in
         the Civil War. Included in these notebooks are lists of
         prisoners taken and guards appointed, munitions, cavalry
         companies and their captains, and mess and pay accounts of the
         soldiers. Also included is a daily record of the movements of
         the 
         <corpname>15th Virginia Cavalry, Company E</corpname>, under
         Captain 
         <persname>Mark Arnold</persname>, and a record of the battles
         and skirmishes in which it was involved. The 
         <corpname>9th Virginia Cavalry</corpname>is also frequently
         mentioned.</p>
      <p>Two folders include material concerning 
         <corpname>King George County Schools</corpname>, such as
         teachers' certificates, letters of the 
         <corpname>King George County Textbook Committee</corpname>,
         correspondence concerning teaching positions (Box 5), and
         three bound volumes (Box 1) entitled "Teacher's Pocket
         Record." These consist of the attendance records and policies
         of 
         <corpname>Potomac District Public School #4</corpname>from
         1876 to 1887 while 
         <persname>Charles G. Alexander</persname>was schoolmaster.</p>
      <p>Medical records and doctors' bills of the 
         <famname>Alexander family</famname>have been separated into
         one folder covering the period from 1826 to 1865. Included in
         these documents are records of medical attention given to
         slaves of the 
         <famname>Alexander family</famname>and of the 
         <famname>Fitzhugh family</famname>. These slaves are often
         mentioned by name.</p>
      <p>Two folders contain the tax records of the 
         <famname>Alexander family</famname>from 1814 to 1886 with some
         undated material. These records are also of particular
         interest because they list the number of slaves held by the
         family in any given year.</p>
      <p>Meteorological surveys and observations were made by 
         <persname>Charles G. Alexander</persname>for the 
         <corpname>U.S. War Department</corpname>in 1874 and 1875.
         These may be found in a folder along with several weather maps
         of the 
         <geogname>United States</geogname>and correspondence between 
         <persname>Charles G. Alexander</persname>and the Chief Signal
         Officer of the 
         <corpname>War Department</corpname>.</p>
      <p>Material concerning 
         <corpname>St. Paul's Church</corpname>in 
         <geogname>King George County</geogname>consists of one folder
         of correspondence and notes, including records of goods and
         money donated to the church, meetings of the vestry, and an
         undated list of pew-holders.</p>
      <p>Some miscellaneous items have been separated into a single
         folder. These include business and calling cards,
         advertisments, poetry of such writers as 
         <persname>Alexander Pope</persname>and 
         <persname>John Stuart Mill</persname>, the passport of 
         <persname>Charles G. Alexander</persname>dated 1849, a school
         report for 
         <persname>Charles G. Alexander</persname>at 
         <corpname>Wood Grove Seminary</corpname>in the 1842-3 term,
         and the will of 
         <persname>Gustavus B. Alexander</persname>, dated 1855. Also
         included is an 1855 application for a land warrant due 
         <persname>Gustavus B. Alexander</persname>as a veteran of the
         War of 1812.</p>
