      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists of the papers of the 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>lawyer, 
         <persname>W. E. Bibb</persname>(1848-1910) and other 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>families, ca. 1830-1940, ca.
         18,250 items (44 Hollinger boxes, 2 oversize folders and 2M
         volumes) of a non-official character removed from private
         offices on the premises of the 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>Court House. Among the
         earliest items are those of Dr. 
         <persname>Baldwin M. Buckner</persname>and the 
         <famname>Buckner family</famname>of 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>. Other persons or subjects
         in the collection include Captain 
         <persname>Boyd M. Smith</persname>, 
         <persname>Reuben Lindsay Gordon</persname>, 
         <persname>John G. May</persname>, 
         <persname>William Worth Smith, Jr.</persname>, Virginia State
         senator, 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>election materials, 
         <corpname>Mineral City Mining</corpname>, 
         <corpname>Manufacturing and Land Company</corpname>, 
         <persname>Robert F. Moss</persname>(d. 1883), 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>sheriff, and 
         <persname>John Q. Rhodes</persname>.</p>
      <p>The papers include correspondence, business &amp; legal
         papers, political papers, and bound volumes, arranged
         alphabetically under the name of the family or individual.
         Papers within each folder are arranged chronologically unless
         otherwise noted in the guide. A number of prominent Virginians
         appear in this collection and are cited in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The National Union Catalog of
         Manuscript Collections</title>but unless they are specifically
         mentioned in this guide or have their own folder the subject
         of the letter is usually a legal or business matter; this is
         especially true of the prominent people who are lawyers.</p>
      <p>The collection has been arranged in five series, 1) 
         <persname>William Emmet Bibb</persname>and the 
         <famname>Bibb Family</famname>(Boxes 1-14), 2) Miscellaneous 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>Families (Boxes 15-24), 3) 
         <persname>Boyd Smith</persname>Papers (Boxes 24-26), 4) 
         <persname>William Worth Smith, Jr.</persname>Papers (Boxes
         26-33), and 5) Bound Volumes pertaining to people in all of
         the previous four series (Boxes 34-43). These papers were
         given to the Library by 
         <persname>Carl Nolting</persname>, Chairman of the 
         <corpname>Louisa County Board of Supervisors</corpname>on
         February 17, 1953.</p>

         <geogname>Louisa County, Virginia</geogname>, whose
         correspondence and other papers (Boxes 1-14) were chiefly
         concerned with his law practice and allied business
         activities, especially real estate development and mineral
         speculation companies, which were widespread but centered in
         the 
         <geogname>Roanoke</geogname>- 
         <geogname>Salem</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Lynchburg</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Waynesboro</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>areas, and correspondence
         pertaining to 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>politics. 
         <persname>Bibb</persname>was also involved with the 
         <corpname>Mineral City Mining, Manufacturing, and Land
         Company</corpname>of 
         <geogname>Mineral, Virginia</geogname>, but these papers have
         been separated and grouped together (see Boxes 20-23, and
         Boxes 40-42, &amp; 2M bound volumes listing, for bound volumes
         pertaining to the company).</p>

         <persname>Kate Lester Cammack</persname>(1855-1942) on
         December 28, 1876, and they had five children:

      <p>Several individuals or companies who frequently

         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>alumnus (1871-1872)
         and his brother, 
         <persname>W.E. Bibb</persname>, is chiefly concerned with
         business deals they have in common, especially a plan by 
         <persname>James Bibb</persname>to purchase a fire clay deposit
         on Ogg's farm in order to make bricks, eventually called the 
         <corpname>Clay Valley Brick and Tile Works</corpname>,
         beginning with his letters of April 1891 and continuing
         through 1894, including the mention of a strike by
         African-American workers at the brick works (1891 Sep 14).
         Other topics include: a purchase of a mill in

         <persname>T.J. Harmon</persname>(real estate), and 
         <persname>James E. Bibb</persname>(notary public). Also
         occasionally mentioned is 
         <persname>James Bibb</persname>'s involvement in the
         publication of weekly newspapers. 
         <persname>James E. Bibb</persname>and

         <geogname>Louisa</geogname>will be redeemed and that instead
         of negroes and white Radicals I will meet a simon pure
         Virginian delegation from your good old county," (1875 Oct
         25); notification of the escape of an inmate from the 
         <corpname>Central Lunatic Asylum</corpname>near 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>who was probably headed for 
         <geogname>Louisa</geogname>(1881 Feb 16); and concerning the
         primary election, 
         <persname>H.V. Winston</persname>asking for support in the
         upcoming election (1880 Jul 1).</p>
      <p><persname>John Q. Rhodes</persname>was the law partner of 
         <persname>W.C. Bibb</persname>in the 1920's and his business
         and legal papers chiefly pertain to his legal work in 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>. In 1936, 
         <persname>Rhodes</persname>became director of the 
         <corpname>Division of Motor Vehicles</corpname>for 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>. He served as a member of the 
         <corpname>House of Delegates</corpname>from 1930-1934. His
         correspondence contains very little personal material and is
         chiefly concerned with the legal cases he represented. An
         unusual item in the business and legal papers is a prospectus
         of the 
         <corpname>Haile Gold Mines, Inc.</corpname>(1937 Jul 15).</p>
      <p>The personal and political folder contains a booklet of
         admission tickets for delegates to the 1924 
         <corpname>Democratic National Convention</corpname>in 
         <geogname>New York</geogname>and the declaration of 
         <persname>Rhodes</persname>for candidacy with supporting
         papers for the 
         <corpname>House of Delegates</corpname>from 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>to 
         <persname>Carl H. Nolting</persname>, Chairman of the 
         <corpname>Louisa County Democratic Committee</corpname>(1933
         May 9).</p>
      <p>Among the papers related to 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>elections and politics are:
         the

         election ballots for 1905; and voting lists (1895 &amp; n.d.)
         with separate "white" and "colored" lists. There is also some
         political material in a folder labelled "Miscellaneous:
         Political &amp; Miscellaneous Documents."</p>
      <p>Businesses represented in this series include: 
         <corpname>Craig Kennels and Game Farm</corpname>,

         <persname>W.E. Bibb</persname>; and the 
         <corpname>Mineral City Mining, Manufacturing, and Land
         Company</corpname>. The directors of this company were

         <persname>W.H.F. Lee</persname>(Vice-President), 
         <persname>W.R. Goodwin</persname>(General Manager), 
         <persname>P.B. Porter</persname>(Secretary &amp; Treasurer,

         <persname>J.F. Bickers</persname>, and 
         <persname>J.W. Flannagan</persname>. Most of the
         correspondence was handled by 
         <persname>P.B. Porter</persname>and then 
         <persname>A.G. Hill</persname>, and was concerned with a new 
         <corpname>C &amp; O Railroad</corpname>depot (1890 Apr 11
         &amp; 19), a petition to change the name of the town of 
         <geogname>Tolersville</geogname>to 
         <geogname>Mineral City</geogname>(1890 Apr 17), questions
         about the charter, the prospectus of the company, the purchase
         of stock shares, and advertisements concerning the property.
         Other types of papers include: bills &amp; receipts, financial
         statements, pay rolls, printed material, and a time book (for
         bound volumes pertaining to the 
         <corpname>Mineral City Mining, Manufacturing, and Land
         Company</corpname>see Boxes 40-42). For a recent discussion of
         the history of 
         <geogname>Mineral</geogname>and the 
         <corpname>Mineral City Mining, Manufacturing, and Land
         Company</corpname>see the Louisa County Historical Magazine,
         Spring 1990 Mineral Centennial Issue, Volume 21, No. 1, pages
         15-27.</p>
      <p>Series III: Boyd Smith Papers</p>
      <p>The 
         <persname>Boyd Smith</persname>mines were first opened about
         1886 by 
         <persname>Boyd Smith</persname>, who was also President of the
         <corpname>Pyrites Mining &amp; Chemical Company</corpname>.
         The mines were never as successful as the nearby 
         <corpname>Arminius Mines</corpname>and much of his business
         and legal papers deal with claims made against 
         <persname>Boyd Smith</persname>and his company, law suits
         against 
         <persname>Boyd Smith</persname>, and attempts to interest
         various mining companies in purchasing his mines in 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>. There is a fair amount of
         correspondence with 
         <persname>W.E. Bibb</persname>who was his legal representative
         in 
         <geogname>Louisa</geogname>and who was appointed Special
         Commissioner to sell the 
         <corpname>Pyrites Mining &amp; Chemical Company</corpname>in
         November of 1900. These files also contain 
         <persname>Boyd Smith</persname>'s personal business and legal
         papers such as late life insurance payments, bills, and other
         matters. Also present are inventories of the stores and tools
         at the pyrite mines listed for potential buyers of the
         property (1900 August &amp; October; 1901 Apr) and examples of
         the 
         <corpname>Pyrites Chemical &amp; Mining
         Company</corpname>store script (see separate folder).</p>
      <p>The folder of family and personal correspondence,
         1897-1903, contains mainly letters from his son, 
         <persname>D. Boyd Smith</persname>to his father, one from his
         wife [Bliss ?] (1902 May 14), and a photograph of [Bliss ?]
         and Mrs. 
         <persname>Bibb</persname>(1901).</p>
      <p>Series IV: William Worth Smith, Jr. Papers</p>
      <p>This series consists chiefly of the legal cases handled by 
         <persname>William Worth Smith, Jr.</persname>(1887-?), a 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>State Senator from 1924-1934,
         arranged alphabetically by the name of the claimant. 
         <persname>William Worth Smith Jr.</persname>'s papers are
         concerned predominantly with the collection of debts for his
         clients but they also contain separate folders of a slander
         case, cases of divorce, the purchase of "Ionia Farm, and law
         suits. 
         <persname>William Worth Smith Jr.</persname>'s correspondence
         folder includes letters of a political nature from 
         <persname>Claude Swanson</persname>, 
         <persname>Charles C. Carlin</persname>, 
         <persname>Howard W. Smith</persname>, and 
         <persname>A. Willis Robertson</persname>. 
         <persname>William Worth Smith Jr.</persname>was born in 
         <geogname>Fauquier County</geogname>to 
         <persname>William Worth Smith</persname>and 
         <persname>Lucinda Lewis Smith</persname>and was educated at 
         <corpname>Randolph-Macon College</corpname>and the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>, receiving his law
         degree in 1910. He was married to 
         <persname>Lucy Winston Sims</persname>, daughter of Judge 
         <persname>F.W. Sims</persname>, and became a dairy farmer in 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>. His only brother was
         Representative 
         <persname>Howard Smith</persname>of the Eighth District.</p>

      <p>This series has three subseries based on the size of the
         items, a) boxed bound volumes, b) 2M bound volumes and c)
