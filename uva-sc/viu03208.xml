      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Correspondents discuss camp life; winter quarters; marches;
         deserters with forged papers and the shooting of deserters;
         illnesses and deaths in battles; prisoners of war,
         particularly the care and transportation of wounded and ill
         Confederates; picket duty and friendly exchanges across the
         lines; hostile behavior against African American troops;
         England's attitude; a comparison of McClellan vs Hooker; and
         opinion of Halleck.</p>
      <p>Engagements mentioned include Harper's Ferry, Antietam,
         Fredericksburg and Union attempts to bridge the Rappahannock,
         Chancellorsville and retreat, destruction of Yorktown, and
         events in Grant's march around Richmond.</p>
      <p>Correspondents include Union soldiers George B. Elmore,
         61st Regiment New York [Engineers?]; Joel W. Gaylord; A. H.
         Mayo, engineer; Thaddeus [K.?] Pendleton, Engineers
         Headquarters, Falmouth; and Samuel W. Richards, Sanitary
         Commission.</p>
      <p>There is also a single letter from T.S.L. to his brother
         and sister, Baltimore, October 12, 1861, discussing the
         fortifications about Baltimore, where they will be ready to
         mount the cannon in two or three weeks, and his work repairing
         army wagons. He has also heard that an expedition of 50,000
         men, including the Eighth and Ninth Maine Regiments, has left
         from Annapolis for an unknown destination.</p>
