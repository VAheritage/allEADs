      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This material, 1798 (1857-1865) 1979, which includes ca.
         135 items, concerns the 
         <famname>Graham</famname>and 
         <famname>Tate</famname>families of 
         <geogname>Wythe County, Virginia</geogname>, and includes
         correspondence, financial and legal papers, genealogical and
         historical information, and an ambrotype of Squire 
         <persname>David Graham</persname>.</p>
      <p>The family papers consist chiefly of letters, 1857-1865,
         from 
         <persname>Charles Beverly Tate</persname>(Feb. 18, 1847-July
         10, 1925), 
         <persname>James Graham Tate</persname>(Dec. 14, 1840-Aug. 25,
         1864), and 
         <persname>William Hanson Tate</persname>(Sep. 19, 1837-May 15,
         1864) to their father, 
         <persname>Charles Campbell Tate</persname>(Jan. 30, 1808-May
         27, 1874), and siblings, 
         <persname>Nannie Montgomery Tate</persname>(Feb. 8, 1843-Jan.
         30, 1923) and 
         <persname>John Montgomery Tate</persname>(July 15, 1833-Nov.
         7, 1881).</p>
      <p><persname>Charles Beverly Tate</persname>entered 
         <corpname>Virginia Military Institute</corpname>in 1862 at the
         age of fifteen. During the 
         <corpname>Battle of New Market</corpname>, where his brother
         William was fatally wounded, he was a cadet private in Company
         C and was detailed to serve in the artillery section of the 
         <corpname>V.M.I. Corps</corpname>. He continued in service
         with the corps until the evacuation of 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>in April 1865. On January 22,
         1865, a few days after being appointed a sergeant in Company
         B, Charles wrote his father, asking his advice as to whether
         or not he should resign 
         <corpname>V.M.I.</corpname>to join the army, and, if so, what
         branch he should enter.</p>
      <p><persname>James Graham Tate</persname>entered 
         <corpname>Emory and Henry College</corpname>in 1859 and
         remained until the spring of 186l. His letters during this
         time were mostly concerned with school, family and friends in 
         <geogname>Wythe County</geogname>, and wanting news of the
         "ladies." On January 10, 1861, he wrote his brother John
         mentioning that he wanted to finish school but that he
         anticipated being called upon to fight soon. On May ll, 1861,
         he enlisted in the 
         <corpname>Wythe Grays</corpname>which later became 
         <corpname>Company A of the 4th Regiment of
         Virginia</corpname>, organized April 28, 1861; the regiment
         was accepted into Confederate service on July 1, 1861. In June
         1861 he wrote from 
         <geogname>Harper's Ferry, Virginia</geogname>about elections
         in his company and adapting to life in the barracks; and
         later, from 
         <geogname>Camp Stevens, Berkeley County</geogname>, he
         described the burning of the Potomac Bridge and public
         buildings which had been ordered by 
         <persname>Joseph E. Johnston</persname>as the Confederates
         evacuated 
         <corpname>Harper's Ferry</corpname>. The 4th Regiment became a
         part of the 
         <corpname>Virginia First Brigade</corpname>, which had
         established itself as the 
         <corpname>"Stonewall Brigade"</corpname>at the First 
         <geogname>Bull Run</geogname>Campaign, July 1, 1861. During
         August and September of that year, he discusses the loss of
         his knapsack and blankets after a skirmish, requested that his
         father send 
         <persname>"Burkhart"</persname>to help in the mess and take
         care of luggage, and mentioned the court martial of a
         deserter, 
         <persname>Francis Tomney</persname>. And, as their marching
         continued, he wondered about their purpose. An interesting
         letter of April 3, 1862, pertains to their orders to take
         their pieces of artillery to 
         <geogname>Staunton, Virginia</geogname>and having to use
         muskets again, the men wanting transfers to artillery and
         cavalry companies, and losing some 76 men in their regiment
         while fighting on March 23 (probably at the 
         <corpname>First Battle of Kernstown, Virginia</corpname>). It
         was not until April 30 that 
         <persname>"Stonewall" Jackson</persname>left 
         <geogname>Elk Run</geogname>heading for 
         <geogname>Staunton</geogname>, which became a major part of
         the 
         <geogname>Shenandoah Valley</geogname>Campaign. During 1863,
         the Confederate armies seemed to be faced with severe
         hardships, including a shortage of rations, the reduction of
         transportation, and the scarcity of "white labor." In the
         spring of 1863, James revealed his disappointment in southern
         farmers for avoiding their duty by not growing grain to feed
         the men in the Confederate armies. In a March 1863 letter,
         Tate mentions 
         <persname>"Jeb" Stuart</persname>'s fight with the enemy,
         calling it a "right brilliant little affair," probably in
         reference to the Battle of 
         <geogname>Kelly's Ford</geogname>in late December when the
         Federal Army pulled back from the site after a day's fighting.
         The following month, April 1863, he writes of marching toward 
         <geogname>Port Royal</geogname>to meet the enemy who was
         crossing 
         <geogname>[the Rappahannock]</geogname>, only to find that
         they had recrossed. At this time there had been a three-day
         Federal expedition operating from 
         <geogname>Bell Plain</geogname>to Port Royal. In late October
         1863, Tate describes the engagement at 
         <geogname>Bristoe Station</geogname>on the 14th which brought
         criticism to General 
         <persname>Ambrose P. Hill</persname>who had "ordered only two
         brigades" to make the charge on General 
         <persname>George Gordon Meade</persname>'s 
         <geogname>Army of the Potomac</geogname>. The following year, 
         <persname>James Graham Tate</persname>was killed at 
         <geogname>Shepherdstown, Virginia</geogname>on August 25.</p>
      <p><persname>William Hanson Tate</persname>became a cadet at the 
         <corpname>Virginia Military Institute</corpname>on July 30,
         1857, and was a member of the 
         <corpname>Cadet Corps</corpname>. While at 
         <corpname>V.M.I.</corpname>, he wrote of living arrangements,
         social activities, new cadet initiation, and news of family
         and friends. In his September 4, 1857, letter, he gave a
         lengthy description of living in "encampment," mentioning the
         barracks and guard duty. As early as October 1857, he was
         looking forward to the cadets' trip to 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>in February 1858; and, on March
         8, 1858, he wrote an interesting and lengthy account of the
         trip to 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>during which the cadets
         represented the 
         <corpname>Virginia Military Institute</corpname>at the
         dedication of the Crawford equestrian statue of 
         <persname>George Washington</persname>in the city's Capitol
         Square on February 22, 1858. In the fall of 1859 he became a
         teacher at the 
         <corpname>Anchor and Hope Academy</corpname>as all 
         <corpname>V.M.I.</corpname>men were expected to serve some
         time as teachers. Between October 1859 and June 1860, his
         letters contained news of the school; and, on February 14,
         1860, he mentioned a trip to Richmond being planned by "Uncle
         David" [Squire 
         <persname>David Graham</persname>] and his father. During this
         time he was on the muster roll of the 
         <corpname>Wythe Grays</corpname>, although his real military
         service was in the 
         <corpname>51st Regiment of the Virginia Volunteers</corpname>.
         He was elected First Lieutenant upon its organization in May
         1861. On November 20, 1861, he described their retreat from 
         <geogname>Cotton Hill</geogname>which resulted in considerable
         loss of property, General 
         <persname>John Buchanan Floyd</persname>'s delay and retreat
         tactics, and illness among the men. In May and June 1862, his
         letters pertained to skirmishes in 
         <geogname>Princeton</geogname>, and mentioned Colonel 
         <persname>Gabriel Calvin Wharton</persname>, General 
         <persname>Henry Heth</persname>, General 
         <persname>[John Buchanan] Floyd</persname>, and General 
         <persname>Humphrey Marshall</persname>. Later, on August 26,
         1863, he wrote of a visit to the 
         <corpname>"Stone Wall Brigade"</corpname>while at 
         <geogname>Liberty Mills</geogname>. In November 1863, in camp
         near 
         <geogname>Blountville, Tennessee</geogname>, he wrote of his
         command witnessing the execution of three deserters from the
         Confederate Army, their orders to move toward 
         <geogname>Knoxville, Tennessee</geogname>and rumors of 
         <geogname>Knoxville</geogname>being captured by General 
         <persname>James Longstreet</persname>. During November 4-22
         the siege of 
         <geogname>Knoxville</geogname>was underway, but the
         Confederate Army was forced to retreat in early December. On
         May 1, 1864, while encamped near his home, 
         <corpname>Max Meadows</corpname>, he wrote that it was his
         duty to remain with his company while so close to their home.
         Soon afterwards, on May 15th, he was killed in the Battle of 
         <geogname>New Market</geogname>while leading a charge. At his
         death he was Captain of 
         <corpname>Company B, 51st Regiment, Wharton's
         Brigade</corpname>.</p>
