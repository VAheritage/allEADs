      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>William W. Abbot (1922-2009) a native of Louisville, Georgia and a long time
                resident of Virginia was an admired and world famous historian, professor, scholar,
                administrator, and editor. His career spanned nearly fifty years and he was
                described as a "man of letters," and an editor of great skill, knowledge, and tact.
                Colleagues also described him as possessing "gentlemanly good humor and decent human
                concern, much valued during his stints as chairman." He was also known for his "acts
                of personal and professional generosity." He changed many lives by offering his
                support to graduate students, working in their best interests to improve their
                writing and find respectable history positions for them throughout the country.</p>
      <p>He was the chief editor of the Papers of George Washington and an expert in early
                American History. He attended Davidson College and graduated from the University of
                Georgia in 1943, whereupon he entered the United States Navy. Using the G. I. Bill,
                he earned his master's and doctoral degrees in history from Duke University in 1953.
                He taught at William and Mary from 1953 to 1962; Northwestern University
                1958-1959; Rice University 1962 and returned to William and Mary from 1963 to
                1966. He edited the William and Mary Quarterly from 1961 to 1966 and the Journal of
                Southern History from 1960 to 1961. He was among the founders of the Association for
                Documentary Editing. In 1966 he was recruited by the University of Virginia to be
                the James Madison Professor of History. In addition to teaching and editing, he
                served twice as the chairman of the Corcoran Department of History at the University
                of Virginia.</p>
      <p>He retired from the University of Virginia in 1992, although he continued to edit
                individual volumes of the Washington Papers until 1998, when nearly fifty volumes
                were in print. He was the author of two books, "The Royal Governors of Georgia,
                1754-1775," and "The Colonial Origins of the United States,
                1607-1763," and a number of articles.</p>
      <p>He was president of the Alpha chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, served on the councils of
                the Institute of Early American History and Culture and the Southern Historical
                Association. For twenty years, he was on the board of editors of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Virginia Quarterly Review,</title> was a member of the
                Gridiron Club at the University of Georgia and the University of Virginia's honorary
                Raven Society.</p>
      <p>The College of William and Mary awarded him the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 1998,
                and the Virginia Historical Society made him a life member. He was best known for
                his work as chief editor of The Papers of George Washington (1977-1992).
                According to his son, Abbot believed that "his chief contribution as a teacher and
                historian came from the attentive reading and detailed responses that he gave over
                the years to the writing of his students and fellow historians." The personal and
                professional correspondence in this collection does indeed confirm that he spent
                much of his time reading and offering helpful advice to thousands of writers.</p>
