      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>A conservationist, environmentalist, and civic and womens'
         rights activist, Joseph Flakne was born on November 10, 1900,
         in Minnesota, where he became interested in nature at any
         early age. In 1929, he hitchhiked to Alaska and attended
         Alaska's Agricultural College and School of Mines, now the
         University of Alaska. To earn tuition, he worked for the U. S.
         Biological Survey, monitoring reindeer, caribou, and other
         wildlife. During 1946-1953, he was chief of the Alaska
         Division of the Office of Territories for the U. S. Department
         of the Interior. In 1946, he and his wife Irene moved to a log
         cabin in Fairfax County's Mason Neck near Washington, D. C.,
         when the Department of the Interior transferred him to work
         for Alaskan statehood. During 1958-1961, he was a labor
         relations officer in Ancorage, Alaska for the U. S.
         Government. In 1964, he retired to his log cabin and began
         donating his time and energy to improving the park system in
         North Virginia. He was a conservation consultant for the
         Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District from
         1972-1986. He continued to be actively involved in
         conservation matters concerning the Occoquan Regional Park,
         Mason Neck State Park, and other natural refuges in the area,
         and worked closely with the NVSWCD and the Northern Virginia
         Regional Park Authority. He received widespread recognition
         for his public service record and his efforts in conservation
         and care of the environment, and was honored with the 1986
         Chevron Conservation Award and the 1989 Elly Doyle Service
         Award, sponsored by the Fairfax County Park Authority.</p>
