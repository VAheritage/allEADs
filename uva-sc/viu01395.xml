      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Philena Carkin was a Massachusetts schoolteacher of
         freedmen in Charlottesville, Va., 1866-1875, under the
         auspices of the American Freedmen's Aid Commission.</p>

    <scopecontent>
      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection contains a bound manuscript journal 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Reminiscences of my Life and Work among
         the Freedmen of Charlottesville, Virginia, from March 1st 1866
         to July 1st 1875. Vol. 1</title>(140 pages), together with a
         carte-de-visite portrait, n.d., of Carkin by Charlottesville
         photographer William Roads, and a copy of her certificate of
         commission as a teacher of ex-slaves issued by the Eastern
         Department of the American Freedmen's Aid Commission.</p>
      <p>In her reminiscences Carkin describes her arrival; the town
         of Charlottesville; military occupation; the University of
         Virginia and its students; Monticello; fellow teachers,
         particularly Anna Gardner, Isabella Gibbons and Paul Lewis;
         schoolhouses, schoolrooms, teaching duties, and students;
         entertainment; and travel, including a trip to Grant's
         inauguration and one to the Virginia constitutional convention
         of 1867-1868.</p>
      <p>She discusses the lives of the freedmen and their desire
         for an education; religious revivals; harassment of the school
         staff and the freedmen by townspeople and university students;
         celebrations and social events; trips to town by local
         mountaineers; and a Rivanna River flood in 1870. Aspects of
         local life different from New England are noted particularly
         in the purchase of food and fuel, lack of sanitation, and
         casual cruelty to animals.</p>
      <p>Thomas Jefferson Randolph and Alexander Rives are mentioned
         briefly.</p>
