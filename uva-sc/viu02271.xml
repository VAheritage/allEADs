      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Yardley family papers contain ca. 160 items, 1814-1906,
         and consist mostly of family correspondence. A large portion
         of the correspondence involves Manly R. Yardley, oldest son of
         John Yardley, and his sons, Claude and Ralph Waldo Emerson
         Yardley.</p>
      <p>Manly Yardley served several years in the 1st New Hampshire
         Cavalry, 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division, (ca.1864-1867) during
         which time he seems to have been very unhappy. He wrote to his
         father [1864 March 15] and to his cousin, William, [1866 June
         19] about his hatred of the army and his desire to leave it. A
         letter dated simply Thursday, 1867 from D. Farwell to John
         Yardley suggested J. M. Edwards as counsel to get his son
         discharged from the army. Since there is no further mention of
         the army, it seems he did manage to arrange a discharge.</p>
      <p>On July 26, 1868, Manly wrote to his parents from Missouri,
         where he apparently went in a great hurry. He said he left to
         be free of his former employers, the Phillips, who he claimed
         swindled him out of $230. He described Mrs. Phillips as "the
         meanest, treacherous, hateful" person and says Mr. Phillips
         should be sent to the house of correction for selling ale on
         Sunday. Manley had a rough time in Missouri and apologized
         constantly in his letters for failing his parents and not
         being a good son [1868 November 14]. Of some interest is the
         letter of November 26, 1868, in which Manley discussed the
         political situation in Missouri and the status of
         ex-Confederate soldiers there.</p>
      <p>The next series of letters concern Russell M. Yardley and
         begin 10 years later. Manley married Elizabeth Straub of
         Mansfield, Ohio, and painted for his livelihood. Evidenced by
         a group of letters from his sister, Adelia, it seems he left
         his wife and young son, Claude. Adelia blamed Elizabeth for
         not being a good wife [1882 September] but managed to get the
         two back together. Over the next ten years, he frequently
         travelled, trying to earn a living as a painter, writing home
         periodically to describe his successes and failures. The
         letters from him stop in 1894, and there is no further mention
         of him by his wife or children after 1899.</p>
      <p>Russell M. and Elizabeth Yardley's oldest son, Claude, left
         home to attend college in Delaware, Ohio, in 1898. Soon after
         he arrived, he discovered he needed nicer clothes to fit in
         with the other boys and decided against becoming a minister
         [1898 October 24]. While in college, most of Claude's letters
         asked for money, apologized for asking for it and promised
         repay his loans. In 1904, Claude moved to Charlottesville; all
         of his letters are on Red-Land Club letterhead, but his
         association with the club was never specified. The Red-Land
         Club (or Redland Club) was called "the swell and aristocratic
         club of Charlottesville" by a magazine writer in 1906. The
         club allowed no dogs or gambling and required a coat and tie
         its the sitting room. A series of letters in 1906 describe his
         life in Charlottesville, although little mention is made of
         his work there.</p>
      <p>Ralph Waldo Emerson Yardley, Russell M. and Elizabeth
         Yardley's second son, went to Columbus, Ohio, in 1902 to work
         as a draftsman [1902 June 15]. In 1904 he began studying
         architecture at the University of Illinois in Champaigne. His
         letters [1904 February 14-1905 November 27] described in great
         detail his activities while at college: his membership in Phi
         Kappa Psi fraternity, directing church choirs, travelling with
         the University glee club, dates with sorority women, pranks
         played on friends, etc. This series of letters provides an
         amusing and interesting account of the life of a popular young
         college man in the early 20th century. Ralph's love and
         concern for his mother and his younger sister, Laura, is
         obvious in these letters; he wrote regularly, sending any
         extra money he had. In one letter to Laura, Ralph solved and
         explained an algebra problem she had apparently sent him [1904
         December 2]. In 1906, Ralph began working in an architecture
         firm in Colombus, where his life settled down into contented
         bachelorhood.</p>
      <p>The remainder of the collection consists of various letters
         among other members of the Yardley family and related
         families. Legal papers in the collection include a deed for
         land in Parkersfield, New Hampshire [1814 March 26], military
         appointments and the resignation of John Yardley [1842-1846]
         and an adoption agreement between Joseph and Harriet Yardley
         and Ellen Cobb for Clara Cobb [1860 February 25]. The
         collection also contains six unidentified photographs.</p>
