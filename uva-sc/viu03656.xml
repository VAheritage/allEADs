         <p>In a long letter, June 15, 1990, George Garrett writes to
         Alan Cheuse concerning his struggle with Stamberg [?] to
         incorporate a short story by Alan Cheuse in the "wedding cake
         books." Stamberg objects to including a selection by Cheuse
         because he is such a good friend of Garrett's although she
         does like Cheuse's work. Garrett urges Cheuse to submit a
         "Wedding Cake in the Middle of the Road" story for the
         proposed anthology which Garrett will accept for 
         <title render="italic">The Texas Review</title>even if it is
         refused by Stamberg for the anthology. Garrett also mentions
         talking [?] Ruffin into devoting a whole issue of 
         <title render="italic">The Texas Review</title>to Southern
         fiction during the fall of 1991 and trying to find an
         university press to do an expanded book version of the issue
         the following year.</p>
         <p>Other topics include a request from Staige Blackford of the
         <title render="italic">Virginia Quarterly Review</title>for an
         essay review of new books of short stories and another essay
         for 
         <title render="italic">the Dictionary of Literary Biography
         Yearbook 1990</title>entitled "The Year in Short Story" in
         both of which Garrett hopes to favorably mention Cheuse's new
         book. Garrett also mentions his anxiety over his new book
         published by Doubleday, Entered From the Sun, and his review
         of Kurt Vonnegut's new book 
         <title render="italic">Hocus Pocus</title>, "He's as wild and
         wooly as ever. Funny, though. He can make me laugh." Also
         mentioned is Michael Mewshaw's article in the 
         <title render="italic">Washington Post</title>about the
         University of Virginia English Department which infuriated
         most of the faculty.</p>
         <p>In another letter, July 10, 1990, Garrett writes about how
         much he likes Douglas Day's new book about several individuals
         involved in the Mexican Revolution and asks if Cheuse thinks
         the publisher Gibbs Smith might be interested in the
         manuscript. He also encloses a copy of a letter from James
         Dickey (March 27, 1990) to a teenager Heather Schafroth.</p>
