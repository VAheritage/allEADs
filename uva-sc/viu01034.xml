      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists of personal correspondence of the 
         <famname>McNeir family</famname>of 
         <geogname>Annapolis, Maryland</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Washington, D.C.</geogname>, containing seventy-five
         letters, 1846-1883, chiefly those of 
         <persname>Joseph McNeir</persname>concerning his experiences
         in the Mexican War, and letters from 
         <persname>Katie Mc Neir</persname>and other family members to
         her brother, 
         <persname>George McNeir</persname>, while he was practicing
         law in 
         <geogname>Minneapolis, Minnesota</geogname>.</p>
      <p>Correspondence of Joseph McNeir during the Mexican War</p>
      <p><persname>Joseph McNeir</persname>, son of 
         <persname>George McNeir</persname>of 
         <geogname>Annapolis, Maryland</geogname>, joined the 
         <corpname>Maryland Volunteer Battalion</corpname>, in 
         <corpname>Captain Piper's Company</corpname>, and left for 
         <geogname>Mexico</geogname>by way of 
         <geogname>Washington</geogname>. The earliest letter (1846 Jun
         20) was a letter of farewell from Joseph's brother, 
         <persname>Thomas Shepherd McNeir</persname>, written while the
         volunteers were waiting to embark for 
         <geogname>Mexico</geogname>.</p>
      <p>Joseph's first letter describes the trip from 
         <geogname>Washington</geogname>to his camp at the 
         <geogname>Brazos de Santiago, Texas</geogname>, located at the
         mouth of the 
         <geogname>Rio Grande River</geogname>, where he arrived on
         July first. He discusses the possible attack routes of General
         <persname>Zachery Taylor</persname>, the unhealthy conditions
         of the camp, his visit to Dr. Wells at 
         <geogname>Point Isabel</geogname>who gave him pen, paper, and
         ink; he also mentions the deserters from the Mexican army
         employed by the Army to store provisions, the rumors about
         General Taylor's campaign plans against 
         <geogname>Vera Cruz</geogname>, seeing the grave of Captain 
         <persname>Samuel Ringgold</persname>who was mortally wounded
         in the Battle of 
         <geogname>Palo Alto</geogname>and several of his men who lost
         limbs during the battle; and tells his family to write him in
         care of Colonel 
         <persname>W.H. Watson</persname>, and reveals their plans to
         leave tomorrow for 
         <geogname>Matamoros</geogname>(1846 Jul 6).</p>
      <p>His father, 
         <persname>George McNeir</persname>, agrees that General Taylor
         will not be able to do much in 
         <geogname>Mexico</geogname>before October, and expresses the
         hope that when the 
         <geogname>Oregon</geogname>boundary dispute between the 
         <geogname>United States</geogname>and 
         <geogname>England</geogname>is resolved the government will
         turn its full attention to the Mexican War; he also mentions
         that the Navy is busy turning out ships supposedly for an
         attack on 
         <geogname>Vera Cruz</geogname>(1846 Jul 26).</p>
      <p>Writing from 
         <geogname>Camargo</geogname>, Joseph shares rumors of an
         impending march to 
         <geogname>Monterrey</geogname>, ninety miles distant; on the
         twelfth of August, his battalion left 
         <geogname>Barita</geogname>for 
         <geogname>Matamoros</geogname>where they remained one day, and
         left 
         <geogname>Matamoros</geogname>on the fifteenth of August,
         arriving at 
         <geogname>Camargo</geogname>around August 23; he describes the
         city of 
         <geogname>Matamoros</geogname>; mentions passing two regiments
         of dragoons and 
         <corpname>Ringgold's Artillery</corpname>commanded by Colonel 
         <persname>David E. Twiggs</persname>who told of rumors of 900
         Comanche Indians in the vicinity; mentions that the Ohio and
         Kentucky Volunteers are marching with the 
         <corpname>Maryland Volunteers</corpname>making them about
         3,000 soldiers in all, travelling with 202 wagons of
         provisions; remarks upon the scarcity of water in the region
         and the suffering from thirst which forces them to march each
         day until they find water; and mentions the unusual flora of
         the area, especially the orange trees (1846 Aug 28).</p>
      <p>A letter from a brother to their father George mentions his
         thankfulness that Joseph survived "the battle," perhaps the
         Battle of 
         <geogname>Monterrey</geogname>(1846 Nov 1). In his letter of
         November 13, 1846, written in a camp in the mountains near 
         <geogname>Monterrey</geogname>, Joseph mentions that he has
         seen battle and survived, that they have plenty of fresh
         water, and that the armistice signed by General Taylor and
         General 
         <persname>Pedro de Ampudia</persname>will be over on November
         13. General 
         <persname>William J. Worth</persname>'s division has left 
         <geogname>Monterrey</geogname>and started for 
         <geogname>Saltillo</geogname>taking with him Colonel 
         <corpname>[Charles A.] May's Dragoons</corpname>from 
         <corpname>Twiggs' Brigade</corpname>, with the rest of General
         <persname>David E. Twiggs</persname>' Brigade remaining to
         take possession of 
         <geogname>Monterrey</geogname>and then proceed to 
         <geogname>San Luis Potosi</geogname>(1846 Nov 13).</p>
      <p>Still writing from a camp near 
         <geogname>Monterrey</geogname>, December 2, 1846, Joseph tells
         of the plan for his division (General 
         <persname>David E. Twiggs</persname>') of 2,000 men to march
         towards 
         <geogname>Victoria</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Tampico</geogname>, where the 5,000 to 10,000
         Mexicans guarding 
         <geogname>Tampico</geogname>are rumored to be some of the same
         soldiers who stood the charge so well at 
         <geogname>Palo Alto</geogname>. General 
         <persname>William J. Worth</persname>is to remain at 
         <geogname>Saltillo</geogname>which his men captured without
         resistance and General 
         <persname>William O. Butler</persname>and his volunteers are
         to remain in 
         <geogname>Monterrey</geogname>. Joseph also reports about
         rumors concerning General 
         <persname>Robert Patterson</persname>bringing a large group of
         men from 
         <geogname>Brazos Island</geogname>to 
         <geogname>Tampico</geogname>, and a controversy in Joseph's
         battalion over the removal of Captain Stewart as Colonel and
         his replacement by Major Buchanan engineered by the officers,
         which prompted the volunteers to send a petition to General
         Taylor asking for the right to choose their own commander. He
         also mentions Mexican skirmishes with the volunteers between
         the camp and 
         <geogname>Monterrey</geogname>, and complains about the
         exaggerated and incorrect accounts of the Mexican campaigns in
         the newspapers (1846 Dec 2).</p>
      <p>In the next letter, Joseph shares the plans of the army to
         move on to 
         <geogname>Victoria</geogname>the next day, in order to capture
         <geogname>Victoria</geogname>which would give the 
         <geogname>United States</geogname>control over three of the
         Mexican states, that 2500 soldiers were left to garrison
         Monterrey, and the plans for General Taylor to join General
         Worth's division at 
         <geogname>Saltillo</geogname>(1846 Dec 12). His next letter
         was written from 
         <geogname>Victoria</geogname>where Joseph arrived around
         December 28 after a sixteen day march from 
         <geogname>Monterrey</geogname>. In the letter he mentions an
         express message which came to General Taylor while at 
         <geogname>Montemorales</geogname>en route to 
         <geogname>Victoria</geogname>with General 
         <persname>David E. Twiggs</persname>' division and General 
         <persname>John A. Quitman</persname>'s Brigade, from General
         Worth at 
         <geogname>Saltillo</geogname>asking for help because he heard
         rumors of an impending Mexican attack. Taylor ordered Quitman
         to continue but returned to 
         <geogname>Saltillo</geogname>with Twiggs' regulars. The
         Mexican plans to attack were called off and Taylor decided it
         was unnecessary to travel to 
         <geogname>Saltillo</geogname>and returned to 
         <geogname>Victoria</geogname>. The four thousand Mexicans at 
         <geogname>Victoria</geogname>evacuated the town before the 
         <geogname>United States</geogname>troops arrived and the
         original troops were augmented by the arrival of General 
         <persname>Robert Patterson</persname>with 5,000 soldiers and
         500 cavalry. Joseph also mentions the presence of numerous
         parrots which the soldiers have taken for pets and the plans
         for General 
         <persname>John A. Quitman</persname>'s division to leave for 
         <geogname>Tampico</geogname>on Saturday, January 9, 1847,
         (1847 Jan 6).</p>
      <p>The next letter from Joseph, January 29, 1847, repeats some
         of the same information as the last but also mentions the loss
         of eleven of Colonel May's dragoons scouting above 
         <geogname>Saltillo</geogname>where the Mexicans pushed rocks
         into a narrow pass cutting off the eleven from their comrades
         and killing them. When Joseph's division left 
         <geogname>Victoria</geogname>for 
         <geogname>Tampico</geogname>on the fifteenth of January, six
         men who fell behind the others during the march to 
         <geogname>Tampico</geogname>were robbed and killed by Mexican
         bandits, General Taylor was ordered to Monterrey by General
         Scott and Taylor issued an order to be read to his men
         concerning the dangers and fatigues they had endured together
         and his regret upon having to leave them. Joseph expresses his
         belief that it is unlikely that they will be sent to 
         <geogname>Vera Cruz</geogname>after all (1847 Jan 29).</p>
      <p>Joseph's last letter from 
         <geogname>Mexico</geogname>mentions that his one year term of
         military service was about over; reports that General Twiggs
         routed the Mexicans at 
         <geogname>Jalapa</geogname>with 5,000 regulars and had taken a
         great deal of artillery and that all troops have left 
         <geogname>Tampico</geogname>except the 
         <corpname>Louisiana Volunteers</corpname>and Joseph's
         battalion, about a thousand in all; and he also writes
         concerning parrots and chihuahua dogs and reports of yellow
         fever at 
         <geogname>Vera Cruz</geogname>(1847 Apr 16).</p>

      <p>The remainder of the 
         <famname>McNeir family</famname>correspondence consists
         chiefly of miscellaneous personal and family news, including a
         reference to the Know-Nothing Party in 
         <geogname>San Francisco, California</geogname>(1855 Dec 20)
         and the anxiety of family members for those absent during the
         Civil War (1862 Jul 16).</p>
      <p>Letters to George and Meda McNeir</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname normal="George McNeir">George</persname>(1860-1941)
         and 
         <persname>Meda McNeir</persname>are chiefly from his sister 
         <persname>Katie McNeir</persname>, his father, 
         <persname>Thomas Shepherd McNeir</persname>, and his brother, 
         <persname>William McNeir</persname>, all of 
         <geogname>Washington, D.C.</geogname>. These letters were
         written between May and July of 1883 while 
         <persname>George McNeir</persname>and his wife, 
         <persname>Meda Burrows</persname>, and his son, 
         <persname>Thomas S. Burrows McNeir</persname>(1882-?), were
         visiting Senator 
         <persname>Julius Caesar Burrows</persname>(1837-1915) and 
         <persname>Frances S. Peck Burrows</persname>of 
         <geogname>Michigan</geogname>, and 
         <persname>Herbert Peck</persname>, in 
         <geogname>Minneapolis, Minnesota</geogname>.</p>
      <p><persname>George McNeir</persname>was born in Washington, D.C.
         to Thomas Shepherd and Emily Schwarar McNeir and attended
         Georgetown University where he received two law degrees, in
         1881 and 1882. He served as a page in the United States Senate
         in 1870, and married 
         <persname>Meda Burrows</persname>, daughter of the Michigan
         Senator 
         <persname>Julius Caesar Burrows</persname>, in 1881. In 1883
         the family moved to Minneapolis where George began to practice
         law in partnership with 
         <persname>Herbert Peck</persname>, possibly the brother of his
         mother-in-law. He practiced law there from 1883 until 1894,
         when he became the manager of the House of W. &amp; J. Sloane,
         1894-1922, and then served as Chairman of the Board of Mohawk
         Carpet Mills, Amsterdam, New York, 1922-[?].</p>
      <p>The letters to George and 
         <persname>Meda McNeir</persname>are chiefly concerned with
         news of the health and activities of family and friends in 
         <geogname>Washington, D.C.</geogname>The majority of letters
         are from 
         <persname>Katie McNeir</persname>, an older sister of George,
         who worked for the Federal Government in Washington, first as
         a clerk in the Census Office of the Interior Department and
         then in the Government Land Office of the Interior Department.
         Her letters provide an interesting view of the "working girl"
         of the late nineteenth century. Her brother, 
         <persname>William McNeir</persname>(1864-) , was also a
         government clerk in the Department of State, and he eventually
         became a bureau chief in the same department. A few topics in
         these letters include: a reference to their visit to Senator
         and Mrs. Burrows in Michigan (1883 May 11); the ambition of
         Senator Burrows to be appointed Commissioner of Internal
         Revenue (1883 May 13); a Grand Army parade in Washington, D.C.
         of two hundred to three hundred drunken veterans (1883 May
         20); the decision of George to go into partnership with 
         <persname>Herbert Peck</persname>in 
         <geogname>Minnesota</geogname>(1883 May 22); and the civil
         service exams and rules, especially the participation of black
         candidates (1883 Jul 19, 2 letters). Although the McNeirs
         remained in 
         <geogname>Minnesota</geogname>for at least ten years, only
         letters covering the first three months of their stay are
         present in the collection.</p>
