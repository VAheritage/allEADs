      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of eight items, 1861-1863: a
         letterbook containing copies of daily reports by Captain J.T.
         Champneys concerning his supervision of defenses at Fort
         Sumter during the siege of Charleston, South Carolina
         (1862-1863), six miscellaneous letters chiefly regarding his
         work as an Confederate ordnance officer, and an undated
         newspaper clipping.</p>
      <p>Champneys was a member of the staff of General Leonidas
         Polk (1806-1864) and received an appointment as ordnance
         officer on November 7, 1861. Promoted to the rank of captain
         in the Engineering Corps on February 15, 1862, Champneys
         apparently obtained the rank of major during his service in
         Department No. 2 (comprising the Mississippi Valley and parts
         of Arkansas, Tennessee, and Louisiana). At one point he was in
         command of an ordnance depot at Okolona, Mississippi, and
         subsequently was chief of ordnance, April 6-7, 1862 until
         ordered to Charleston on October 23, 1862. During his tenure
         at Fort Sumter (April 1862 through October 1863) he held the
         rank of captain of engineers until he was relieved of ordnance
         duty on April 23, 1863, though he was apparently stationed
         there for some time afterwards. According to one source
         Champneys was a resident of Apopka, Florida, in 1895 and
         possibly a vice-president on the Board of Trustees of the
         Monteagle Sunday School Assembly, a Christian community adn
         summer resort in Monteagle, Tennessee.</p>
      <p>The Letterbook (April 1862-October 1863): This bound volume
         has 140 numbered pages, some of which are damaged, missing, or
         blank: 21-22, 33-34, 36-37, 48-49, and 51-68. Page 69-70 is
         detached from the volume and has been filed with the material
         in section B.</p>
      <p>Pages 2 to 32 contain Champneys' accounts of "commutations"
         (replacements) of clothing (shoes, shirts, drawers, caps,
         socks, pants, unifrom jackets, blankets, etc.), various goods
         and payrolls for a South Carolina (?) regiment's companies A
         through K. Supplies for a band and Fort Sumter's hospital are
         also indicated. Individuals alluded to are Captain Motte A.
         Pringle, quartermaster; Lieutenant J.R. Macbeth; and a Private
         Johna Johnson of Company D.</p>
      <p>Champneys' ca. eighty-five morning reports and related
         letters appear between pages 38 and 140; a few are not in the
         proper chronological sequence and are continued in the latter
         part of the volume; other have more than one entry for
         specific days. He describes construction, repairs, the results
         of Union bombardments, the use of slave labor, and similar
         occurrences. Most (fifty-eight) were addressed to his
         superior, Major William H.Echols, chief engineer of South
         Carolina's Engineering Bureau during the siege. In late
         October 1863 a few of these reports were signed by Champneys
         on behalf of C.J. Tennent, assistant engineer. Comparable
         reports and communications were addressed to Colonel David. B.
         Harris (1814-1864), chief engineer of the Department of South
         Carolina, Georgia, and Florida; Major Stephen Elliot
         (1830-1866), commander of the engineer's office at Fort Sumter
         and later a Confederate general; Major Motte A. Pringle;
         Thomas Bennett, assistant superintendent of slave labor;
         Lieutenant John C. Riley, acting assistant quartermaster; and
         Captain William Nance, assistant quartermaster.</p>
      <p>Several of the fort's employees, soldiers, and staff are
         named throughout the reports: Nicholas Devereaux, assistant
         superintendent of slave labor; LePaye, foreman of carpenters;
         Gadbury Moll and James [?]oyhtery, carpenters; [?] Robinson,
         [?] Smith, [?] Wheeler, and W.B. Natcher, slave overseers;
         Joseph Baker, Engineering Department; and, Dr. Bennett, fort
         surgeon. Confederate officers, especially generals, are
         mentioned as visitors or inspectors: Pierre G.T. Beauregard
         (1818-1893); Gabriel J. Rains (1817-1898); Rosewell Sabine
         Ripley (1823-1887); Jeremy Francis Gilmer (18181-1883);
         Lieutenants Edwin A. Ford, John T. Elmore, John Johnson
         (1829-1907), [?] Veal (at Sullivan's Island), and J.B. Lanneau
         (Company B, 25th South Carolina Infantry); Major Julius A.
         Blake (27th South Carolina); Captains [?] Gooding (27th South
         Carolina); Peter C. Gaillard (1st South Carolina Artillery),
         and [?] Eason; Privates John H. Houston and Bennett L.
         [?](25th South Carolina Infantry); also cited are Fraser
         Matthews and a Mrs. Martha Hemphill of York District.</p>
      <p>There are numerous references to slaves and slave labor
         (September 23 &amp; 24, October 1, 10, &amp; 28, 1863). One
         slave is mentioned as the victim of Union shelling (September
         29); the duties of blacks are summarized by Champneys (October
         8) who reports an outbreak of typhoid fever among them
         (October 22). The firms of Robertson &amp; White and WIlliam
         &amp; C[?] were the fort's suppliers of slaves.</p>
      <p>Various naval vessels, fortifications, and military units
         are discussed or indicated: U.S.S.

         South Carolina Infantry; the 1st South Carolina Artillery; and
         , Company B of the Washington Light Artillery.</p>
      <p>Champneys recounts a salute held in honor of a Confederate
         victory [the battle of Chicamauga] on September 24 and of a
         failed Union assault [September 9] against Sumter (September
         28). Of special interest are: a letter from Champneys to Dr.
         William Nixon of Paulding, Jasper County, Mississippi, in
         which he requests that Nixon keep an eye on his plntation
         (October 16); orders for the arrest of certain employees who
         were absent without leave (October 5); shortages of overseers
         for blacks (October 10); the arrival of 880 bags of sand
         (October 18); and, a description of a massive Union
         bombardment that almost destroyed the fort--679 shells were
         fired at it (October 28).</p>
      <p>The Letters (1861, 1862 &amp; 1863): There are six in
         number plus an unrelated newspaper clipping. In the first
         letter, January 19, 1861, W.A. Ramsey of Memphis, Tennessee,
         informs "Champ" that he has completed work on the Mississippi
         River Railway; although he remains a Union man Ramsey refers
         to Mississippi as a "republic" and asks Champneys' opinion of
         orders by Governor John J. Pettus (1813-1867) that all ships
         at Vicksburg be stopped and searched.</p>
      <p>A copy of General Order 24, April 16, 1862, from
         Confederate Adjutant and Inspector General Samuel Cooper
         (1789-1876) outlines procudures for the appointment and duties
         of ordnance officers. On October 23, 1862, Champneys, writing
         from Chattanooga, Tennessee, as a major and ordnance officer
         of artillery in Department No. 2, informs General Benjamin
         Hardin Helm (1830-1863) of his decision to withdraw charges of
         disobedience and terminate the confinement of Private John Day
         of the Ordnance Department.</p>
      <p>[J.H.?] Reid, of the ordnance office at Enterprise,
         Mississippi, reports the return of certain soldiers to their
         units in his letter of January 15, 1863. Colonel Clark,
         Sergeant Murray, Lieutenant Thoebalds(?), [?] Shacklock, and
         [?] Cady are briefly noted. Reid observes that Champneys'
         horse, which had run off, has returned minus its saddle and
         bridle. In a letter of January 26, 1863, Thomas M. Bartlett of
         Chattanooga speaks of Major Wicks, Colonel Richmond, Dr.
         Blackburn, and generals [Lucius Eugene] Polk (1823-1877) and
         Braxton Bragg (1817-1876); Governor Oliver Perry Morton
         (1823-1877) of Indiana and Abraham Lincoln (1809- 1865) are
         referred to as Bartlett discusses attempts by Democrats and
         Republicans to dominate Indiana's senatorial election.</p>
      <p>The remaining letter in this group is dated June 14, 1863
         and is addressed to Champneys from a Mrs. S.L. of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Forest Home,</title>Desoto County,
         Mississippi. She describes a trip through Mississippi locales
         such as Grenada, Belmont, Jackson, Memphis, Vicksburg, and the
         Tallahatchie River to visit a relative. Also mentioned is her
         nephew, Edmund Eason, and a Lieutenant Chapman; the burning of
         Hernando, Mississippi, and the Yankee depredations [May 1863];
         the death of a cousin at Grand Gulf [May 3rd, 1863?]; the oath
         of allegiance; and her possession of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">a bottle of good whiskey and peach
         brandy (not purchased from the Yankees),</title>as an
         inducement for visits by 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">gentlemen friends.</title></p>
      <p>Mrs. S.L. continues her letter on June 16 with news of the
         nomination of Clement L. Vallandigham (1820-1871) for governor
         of Ohio and her hopes that Lincoln 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">will refuse to give him up and
         thereby create greater fuss among the Democrats and
         Republicans and let it all end in a war among
         Thereselves.</title>She urges Mr. and Mrs. Champneys to visit
         her.</p>
      <p>Page 69-70, September 23, 1863, is from the letterbook and
         has been filed among these letters for its preservation.</p>
      <p>The final item of the collection is an undated and
         unidentified South Carolinian newspaper article, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Evacauation of St. Simon's
         Island,</title>on the faithfulness of a slave named Henry and
         of Captian Hazzard's Rangers during the fighting and
         occupation of this Georgia island.</p>
      <p>Additional identification and select information for many
         of the aforementioned individuals and events associated with
         the fort and the siege of Charleston may be found in Warren
