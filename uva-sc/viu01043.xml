      <p>This collection of twenty-one items, 1936-1963, is
         comprised of materials by and about author 
         <persname>Murrell Edmunds</persname>and his brother, poet 
         <persname>Abe Craddock Edmunds</persname>. Included are
         correspondence, Christmas cards, and clippings sent to their
         friends, 
         <persname normal="Samuel Allen Chambers">Samuel
         Allen</persname>and 
         <persname>Edith Chambers</persname>of Lynchburg.</p>
      <p><persname>Murrell Edmunds</persname>(1898-1981), born in
         Halifax, received his Bachelor of Law degree from the
         University of Virginia in 1921 and went on to a brief career
         of teaching and in law before devoting himself to writing. He
         wrote novels and short stories, including 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Sojourn Among Shadows</title></bibref>(1936), 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Passionate Journey to Winter</title></bibref>(1962), and 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Reservoir</title></bibref>(1977). In the beginning, his books, which probed
         "contemporary and philosophical concepts," were not well
         received, but they eventually gained public acceptance with
         the help of publisher 
         <persname>Thomas Yoseloff</persname>.</p>
      <p><persname>Abe Craddock Edmunds</persname>(1899-1959), also
         born in Halifax, graduated from Randolph-Macon College in
         Ashland and received his masters degree from the University of
         Virginia. One of his major books, 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">The Renaissance</title></bibref>(first published in 1932 and revised in 1954), marked
         him as a poet of significance. Other works included 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Geese are Swan</title></bibref>(1929), 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Twenty-Nine Poems</title></bibref>(1940), and 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Thirty-Five Poems</title></bibref>(1951). He sought perfection in his work and was
         often referred to as a man of poetic genius.</p>
      <p>Murrell Edmunds' correspondence to Sam and Edith Chambers
         include two Christmas cards and a November 14, 1959, letter
         concerning his brother's death and the possibility of
         presenting his books to Alderman Library's Rare Books and
         Manuscripts Division. There is also a letter, December 13,
         1962, addressed to the 
         <corpname>Lynchburg Chamber of Commerce</corpname>, in
         appreciation of the local paper's review of his 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Passionate Journey to Winter</title></bibref>.</p>
      <p>Craddock Edmunds' letters to Sam and Edith Chambers were
         mostly concerned with the couple's complete set of the poet's
         works. On May 5, 1937, Edmunds sent them a first edition of
         his 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">The Renaissance</title></bibref>bearing his holograph revisions; and, later he
         borrowed the edition to make additional revisions, returning
         it on February 15, 1954. Another reference to the collection
         was in his December 26, 1957, letter concerning 
         <corpname>Mary Washington College</corpname>'s interest in
         buying a complete set of his books. Also included is a 1940
         booklet, 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Twenty-Nine Poems</title></bibref>, with contents pasted in and notes made by
         Edmunds.</p>
