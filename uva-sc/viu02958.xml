      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers contain documents, letters, broadsides and
         miscellaneous material relating to the abolition of the slave
         trade and the anti-slavery movement in Great Britain and
         America. A few of the letters were kept by the compiler for
         their autograph value (Duke of Wellington, Disraeli) but have
         no discernible connection to the abolition movement.</p>
      <p>
Correspondence and documents relate to the anti-slavery movement in America and to the abolition of slavery in Africa and South America, 1821-1887.</p>
      <p>
Much of the correspondence consists of letters written to Thomas Denman, Margaret Denman Cropper, and Henry William Macaulay on English efforts to abolish the international slave trade.</p>
      <p>
Of interest are letters from Sierra Leone residents seeking employment or making other requests of Henry William Macaulay or William Wilberforce.</p>
      <p>
Items of United States interest include a letter from Thomas Clarkson on slave-holding clergy in the South and letters from Frederick Douglass to Margaret Cropper on the anti-slavery cause, the aid of the Liverpool Society, gifts from Mrs. Cropper, and the destitution of escaped slaves.</p>
      <p>
There are also a few letters from Thomas Babington Macaulay to Mrs. Henry William Macaulay on family matters and a request for documents from the 1690s.</p>
      <p>
Miscellaneous letters include one from a gunner on the "Scylla," captured and imprisoned by the Carlists, and one from Robert Cecil on winning over the Roman Catholics of Ireland.</p>
      <p>
The papers also contain a few letters collected by the compiler for their autograph value and having nothing to do with abolition. These include two letters from the Duke of Wellington on a railway from Warrington to Liverpool, social notes from Disraeli and Bulwer-Lytton, a letter forwarding orchids from Robert H. Schomburgk, a letter from George Biddell Airy on a magnetic disturbance on an iron ship, a letter from John Taylor Coleridge conveying family news, and an envelope addressed in 1871 by one of the last survivors of Waterloo.</p>
      <p>
Miscellaneous items include broadsides from the Sierra Leone Turf Club and one regarding a regatta, and an invitation to the coronation of William IV.</p>

      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The letters were originally in a bound volume, grouped
         roughly by type of material and by correspondent but otherwise
         in no discernible order. The original arrangement has been
         maintained.</p>

               Liverpool continue to obtain signatures for their
               address while he and the London Committee do the same
               there. He explains that upon completion the two lists

               differences in wording between the addresses and
               requests that Cropper not send anything to London until

               efforts to change opinion in the United States. He
               informs the recipient that the clergy of the South are
               not only slaveholders themselves and mistreat their
               slaves but that they defend the practice in the pulpit.
               He states that this defense of slavery has spread to the
               North and that overall, seven-tenths of the clergy in
               America do not consider slavery a sin. Clarkson was
               requested to use his influence to try and change the
               opinions of the clergy and, after deliberation due to
               his age, acquiesced. His writing on the subject was
               printed and sent to the United States, where 100,000
               copies were to be made. [A letter to the clergy of
               various denominations, and to the slave-holding

               for review and to assess its likely effectiveness
               altering the clergy's position. Together with a

               Liverpool Antislavery Society donation towards the
               publication of his antislavery papers. He reports on the
               progress of the antislavery cause in the U.S. and the
               nature of the movement compared with ten years earlier.
               Specifically, he describes more action being taken by
               individuals than by organizations. He stresses the
               importance of constantly reminding the people about the
               movement in order to sway their opinions. He credits
               assistance from abroad with helping by allowing him to
               work more efficiently and by giving him influence among
               his people because he is not asking them for financial
               support. He also discusses the destitute situation of

               furnish escaping slaves with tools as they pass
