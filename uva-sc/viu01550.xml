      <p>This collection consists of seven letters from Samuel
         Taggart (1754-1825), a Federalist member of the United States
         House of Representatives from Massachusetts, 1803-1817, and a
         Presbyterian minister, to the Rev. Jedidiah Morse (1761-1826),
         a Congregationalist minister, founder and editor of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Panoplist,</title>"father of
         American geography," and author of a report concerning the
         conditions of the Indian nations (1822) made to the Secretary
         of War. The letters are chiefly concerned with Congressional
         activities and the War of 1812.</p>
      <p>In a letter of March 5, 1814, Taggart discusses the loan
         bill which would allow the Federal Government to pay the war
         expenses for the coming year, "I think moneylenders have not
         the greatest encouragement as no adequate funds are pledged
         even for the payment of the interest." He mentions the desire
         of Congress for peace with Great Britain, "They have been
         frustrated in all their plans of the invasion of Canada. They
         have been happily disappointed in all their calculations on
         events in Europe. The idea of finally crushing the British
         nation is pretty much given up." He also discusses the
         difficulty in funding the war, the balance of trade going
         against the South which resented the flow of its money into
         Northern coffers, the pressure of the war taxes and embargo on
         the economy and the political ambitions of Samuel Dexter
         (1761- 1816) for the governorship of Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>On October 20, 1814, he writes concerning the lack of
         progress towards peace by the Commissioners at Ghent, his
         anger against those who plunged the nation into an unnecessary
         and ruinous war without the preparation or the means to carry
         it out, refers to the report by Secretary of the Treasury
         George W. Campbell concerning the nation's bankruptcy and
         outlines the system of taxation presented to Congress by the
         chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, promises a copy of
         the instructions given to the American Commissioners in Ghent
         that are public knowledge, expresses his fears concerning a
         possible mutiny by the army, criticizes the awarding of medals
         for the costly victories at Plattsburg and Lake Champlain,
         describes the resolution to enpower the Library Committee to
         purchase Mr. Thomas Jefferson's library of about ten thousand
         volumes to replace those burnt by the British for about forty
         or fifty thousand dollars, includes a disparaging remark about
         President Madison's lack of courage, mentions the ruins of the
         city and the plundering of its buildings largely by criminal
         elements of Washington taking advantage of the confusion, and
         shares his amazement at the abandonment of Washington to the
         enemy without a fight.</p>
      <p>His November 28, 1814, letter discusses the National Bank
         Bill, the Whiskey Tax Bill, and two conscription bills, one
         for the militia and one for the regular army, both of which he
         opposes due to the bankruptcy of the Treasury. He relates his
         anticipation and hopes for the meeting of the Hartford
         Convention called by the Massachusetts Legislature but states
         his belief that the Union is not yet in danger of dissolution.
         He also names several states that are predominantly
         Federalist.</p>
      <p>Taggart describes the political successes of the Federalist
         Party in North Carolina, the impressive speech of Daniel
         Webster for the minority view of the [Giles ?] Conscript
         Militia Bill, and the "monstrous doctrine" of the Secretary of
         War James Monroe (December 14, 1814).</p>
      <p>He notes the postponement of discussion concerning the
         Militia Bill by the Senate until March because of some of its
         more radical proposals, the ardent debate over the National
         Bank Bill, news of the British attack on New Orleans, and the
         epidemic among troops at Richmond and Norfolk (December 29,
         1814).</p>
      <p>He relates the opening of Congress, the move from the
         patent office to a new temporary headquarters for Congress
         until the Capitol building could be repaired, the excellence
         of Madison's [State of the Union] speech, described as the
         best presidental communication since Thomas Jefferson's
         Inaugural, various proposals to deal with the national debt,
         the mention of an Unitarian controversy, involving the
         writings of William Ellery Channing (1780-1842), Dr. [Samuel
         ?] Worcester (1770-1821), and Mr. Wardlaw (December 12,
         1815).</p>
      <p>The last letter, February 22, 1817, mentions several
         petitions from New Englanders in opposition to the
         transportation of mail on the Sabbath, the postponement of the
         repeal of internal taxes and a reduction in the army, news of
         religious revivals in various areas of the country, and his
         plans to retire from the House of Representatives.</p>
