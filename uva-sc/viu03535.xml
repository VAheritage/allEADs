      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Patrick Henry Drewry was born in Petersburg, Virginia, May
         24, 1875. he attended public schools, Petersburg High School,
         and McCabe's University School. Drewry graduated from
         Randolph-Macon College in Ashland (1896) and later received
         his law degree from the University of Virginia. For a brief
         time he taught English and Greek at Centenary College in
         Palmyra, Missouri. Following his admission to the Virginia bar
         (1901), Drewry returned to his home state to practice law. He
         was a member of two well-established Petersburg firms:
         Lassiter &amp; Drewry and Drewry &amp; Old. He also served for
         a short time as director of Petersburg Savings and American
         Trust Co.</p>
      <p>Drewry always took an active interest in state politics. In
         1912, he was elected to the Virginia General Assembly,
         representing the 29th senatorial district (Dinwiddie County
         and Petersburg City). Throughout his political career, he
         enjoyed a favorable reputation as a diligent and competent
         legislator, and was rewarded for his efforts with the
         unwavering support of his constituency. As chairman of the
         Senate Fish and Game Committee, Drewry helped to secure needed
         legislation to protect Virginia's wildlife. He was well
         acquainted with state fiscal affairs and served as chairman of
         the Economy and Efficiency Commission of Virginia (1916-1918)
         and chairman of the State Auditing Committee (1916-1918). Both
         agencies exerted considerable control over state finances. In
         1919, as chairman of the State Advisory Board, Drewry was
         instrumental in formulating the Commonwealth's first official
         budget.</p>
      <p>Drewry was continually active in party politics, serving as
         delegate to several Democratic state and national conventions.
         In 1923, he was named a member of the Democratic National
         Committee and later elected as chairman. He held this position
         for 12 years (1935-1947), longer than any of his
         predecessors.</p>
      <p>In 1920, Drewry was elected to the 66th U. S. Congress,
         filling an unexpired term. He represented Virginia's fourth
         congressional district for 27 years. Moderate in his views and
         quiet in nature, Drewry avoided political controversy,
         partisan strife, and Congressional spotlights. He served as
         ranking Democratic member of the House Naval Affairs Committee
         during a period of rapid naval contracts. He played a key role
         in the committee's investigation of the Brewster Aero-nautical
         Corporation which had a government defense contract but failed
         to satisfy production agreements.</p>
      <p>Drewry's voting record in the House was marked with a high
         degree of party regularity. Despite the dynamic role he played
         in national politics, he was never considered part of the
         "inner circle" of the State Democratic Organization. But
         Drewry was able to capture the confidence of Virginia voters,
         and was continually re-elected to his post without threatening
         opposition.</p>
      <p>Patrick Drewry was a member of the American and Virginia
         State Bar associations, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Phi Beta
         Kappa and Sigma Chi fraternities, and Alumni Association of
         Randolph-Macon College. He also served as a member of the
         board of visitors to the United States Naval Academy. Drewry
         married Mary Elizabeth Metcalf in 1906 and had three sons:
         Patrick Henry; John Metcalf; and William Emmett. He died
         December 21, 1947 at his home in Petersburg.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Patrick Henry Drewry Collection (ca. 16,500 items, 23
         shelf feet) is comprised of legal correspondence, family
         financial papers, and some personal correspondence covering
         the years ca. 1825-1948. Most of the material relates to
         Drewry's legal practice in Petersburg, Virginia as a member of
         the firm Lassiter and Drewry (1907-1921) and later during the
         partnership of Drewry &amp; Old. The collection includes
         letters from various clients as well as professional
         correspondence with several prominent Virginia attorneys,
         i.e.; B. F. Glahn, Samuel Carter, W. R. McKenney. As a member
         of the Virginia State Senate (1912-1920) and as a U.S.
         Congressman (1920-1947) Drewry continued to practice law. The
         letters and papers in the collection reflect Drewry's
         continuing concern with private legal cases and his commitment
         to the general welfare of his constituents.</p>
      <p>In the initial stages of his career, Drewry focused his
         professional efforts on settling small property claims and
         securing veteran benefits for his clients. He also handled a
         few criminal and divorce cases. The documentation and
         correspondence concerning a few cases is fairly complete. In
         1906, Drewry acted as defense attorney for George Gee, a poor
         black man accused of murder. Later, Drewry acted as lawyer and
         friend to Pattie Harris, handling a lengthy legal dispute
         between Harris and the Virginia State Highway Commission
         concerning the construction of a road through Ms Harris's
         property. The Harris Family papers, ca. 1825-1943, make up a
         large proportion of the Drewry collection.</p>
      <p>During his eight years in the Virginia General Assembly,
         Drewry played an active role in the passage of legislation
         advancing the State highway system and affecting the Virginia
         Health Department and the Board of Charities and Corrections.
         The papers include some information concerning the Vital
         Statistics Bill (1919) which Drewry helped to formulate.</p>
      <p>Drewry was keenly interested in economic affairs and state
         finances. As a state senator, he served as chairman of the
         Governor's Advisory Board on the Budget. The collection
         includes copies of budget documents as well as a few letters
         for Governor Westmoreland Davis concerning the preparation of
         the state budget.</p>
      <p>As an ardent opponent to statewide prohibition, Drewry
         worked closely with the Virginia Association for Local Self
         Government. The campaign for local option is clearly outlined
         in the correspondence. There are also a few letters concerning
         women's suffrage.</p>
      <p>As a member of the State Auditing Committee and chairman of
         the Commission on Economy and Efficiency, Drewry corresponded
         frequently with other officials regarding the financial
         interests of the state. There is a good deal of information
         concerning county audits and reports on investigations of
         various agencies, organization, state schools, hospitals, etc.
         Drewry also belonged to the Virginia Council of Defense and
         the Four Minute Men, two patriot organizations established to
         enlist and maintain public enthusiasm and support during World
         War I. There are several letters concerning the
         responsibilities and activities of both organizations.</p>
      <p>Although Drewry served as a U.S. congressman for
         twenty-seven years, there is not a great deal of information
         concerning his political career in Washington. Drewry
         corresponded frequently with his secretary, W. L. Bragg, on
         matters concerning individual legal cases, civil service
         appointments, private pension claims, etc. There is no
         significant correspondence between Drewry and his
         congressional colleagues. There is some information regarding
         various investigations conducted by the sub-committee of Naval
         Affairs, state redistricting plans, improvement of Virginia's
         postal service and expansion of rural routes. There is little
         material concerning election campaigns or party politics, and
         only a few personal letters between Drewry and family
         members.</p>

      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>Part one of the Patrick Henry Drewry Collection consists of
         twenty-one boxes and is arranged chronologically. Included are
         legal documents, business papers, receipts, cancelled checks,
         social correspondence, and personal correspondence. There is
         also material relating to Virginia politics, Drewry's
         campaigns, legislation; patronage, and such controversial
         issues as woman suffrage and the local option. Although the
         correspondence in this section has not been systematically
         organized the material covering politics and Drewry's public
         career is concentrated in boxes 4-11 and 21. Material covering
         Drewry's business and personal affairs is interspersed
         throughout this segment of the collection.</p>
      <p>Part two is comprised of boxes 22-29. It contains material
         similar to that in the first section. It is arranged
         alphabetically. Among the items of interest are the file on
         James Cannon and the Local Option Campaign.</p>
      <p>There are also two small family collections at the end of
         the papers. Boxes 48-52 contain the Harris Family papers.
         Arranged chronologically, this collection is primarily related
         to financial and legal matters of the family. The A. G. Ryland
         Papers in boxes 54 and 55 are also arranged chronologically
         and contain business papers.</p>
