      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 160 items, 1943-1945,
         chiefly the letters from Captain Charles G. Fox, Jr.,
         originally of Shawyer's Mill, Virginia, to his wife Claudyne
         [Worley ?] Fox, while serving in the Medical Corps in the
         United States, Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and
         the Netherlands. Charles Fox, Jr., took his final medical
         exams at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, during September 1943 and
         looked forward to his own medical practice at the end of the
         war. These deeply personal letters illustrate clearly how much
         World War II affected the personal lives of many American
         families, especially the "war marriages" that occurred during
         those uncertain years. Charles G. Fox, Jr. ([1915 ?] - ?) and
         Claudyne [Worley ?] were married on October 27, 1942, and Fox
         requested not to be called to active duty prior to August 15,
         1943, because they were expecting their first child, Charlyne,
         at the end of July. Their second child, Gary, was born on
         March 5, 1945, while Charles Fox was serving in the 320th
         Medical Battalion in Europe. Many of his letters mention his
         pain at being separated from his growing family and new wife
         at the beginning of their life together. Others discuss all
         the everyday difficulties with communication, money, repairs,
         business matters, payments, etc. that occurred because
         families were separated during wartime.</p>
      <p>Other correspondents include: Lt. George M. Pride to
         Claudyne Fox (1944 May 21 &amp; 1945 Apr 13); Claudyne's
         sister-in-law, Madge Worley, Queensland, Australia, to
         Claudyne, about her marriage to Wilbert Worley and her desire
         to meet the other sisters, Virginia and Lucille (1944 Sep 10);
         Wilbert P. Worley, 91st Repl. Battalion, to his sister
         Virginia, about his new wife (1944 Nov 9); a friend, Janice O.
         Evans, to Claudyne (1944 Nov 16); cousin Mamie Gibson to
         Claudyne (1945 Feb 4); a Christmas card, 1944, from Mr. &amp;
         Mrs. T.J. Higginbotham to Claudyne; Charlie Fox to his
         sister-in-law, Virginia, about the birth of his son (1945 Mar
         16); and a telegram from Virginia to Charlie notifying him
         about his wife's ruptured disk (1945 Sep 25).</p>
      <p>The letters from Charlie to Claudyne began in July 1944
         when he left for his post with Company "C" 320th Medical
         Battalion, Indiantown Gap, Military Reservation, Pennsylvania,
         on July 22, 1944, and Claudyne and her daughter Charlyne,
         returned to Richmond, Virginia. Fox left the Boston harbor on
         August 6, 1944, on the Mariposa, a former luxury liner,
         reached the coast of Scotland on the twelfth, and stopped at
         Liverpool. He then traveled across England to Winchester by
         train.</p>
