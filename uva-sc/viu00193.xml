      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Archibald Stuart was born on March 19, 1757, in Staunton,
         Virginia, the son of Alexander and Mary (Patterson) Stuart. He
         was educated at the Augusta Academy, the College of William
         and Mary, and studied law with Thomas Jefferson following the
         American Revolution. He then began practicing law in the
         Shenandoah Valley and served as a judge of the General court
         of Virginia from 1800 until just before his death.</p>
      <p>Stuart was also active in politics as a leader of the
         Jeffersonian Democrats in Virginia. He was elected to the
         Virginia House of Delegates from Botetourt County in 1783 and
         was particularly active in the reform of the state court
         system and the reorganization of state government. He also
         played a prominent role in the ratification of the new federal
         Constitution in 1788, was a member of the Virginia-Kentucky
         Boundary Commission in 1795, a member of the Virginia Senate
         at the turn of the century, and was a presidential elector for
         the Jeffersonian Democrats from 1800 to 1824. Stuart married
         Eleanor Briscoe, the daughter of Gerard Briscoe of Frederick
         County, Virginia, in May, 1791, and died in Staunton on July
         11, 1832.</p>
      <p>Briscoe Gerard Baldwin was born on January 18, 1789, in
         Winchester, Virginia, the eldest son of Cornelius Baldwin and
         Mary Briscoe, another daughter of Gerard Briscoe. He attended
         William and Mary College and later studied law under Judge
         William Daniel in Cumberland County, Virginia. During
         1818-1820 he served in the Virginia House of Delegates as
         representative for Augusta County; and, in 1829-1830 was a
         member of the constitutional convention. He returned to the
         House of Delegates during 1841-1842. On January 29, 1842,
         Baldwin was elected a member of the Supreme Court of Appeals
         of Virginia and held that position until his death on May 18,
         1852.</p>

         (1789-1852) of Staunton, Virginia. The collection is comprised
         chiefly of correspondence and legal and financial papers

         Baldwin to her husband, Briscoe G. Baldwin, containing news of
