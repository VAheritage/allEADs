      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>James Lawson Kemper (1823-1985), Confederate general and
         governor of Virginia, was born June 11, 1823, in Madison
         County, Virginia. He attended the Virginia Military Institute
         and Washington College, received his B.A. from the latter in
         1842, and commenced practicing law a year later. At the
         outbreak of the Mexican War in 1846 Kemper was comissioned a
         captain in the Virginia volunteers, but did not see active
         service. Returning to Virginia and his law practice, in 1853
         he married Cremora Conway Cave, affectionately called "Belle"
         by her husband. They were to have six children. The same year
         Kemper was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates for the
         first of five terms, the last (1861-1863) as speaker of the
         house. He headed the committee on military affairs and was
         appointed president of the Board of Visitors at the Virginia
         Military Institute. In 1861 Kemper advocated calling the state
         convention that eventually declared Virginia's secession from
         the Union on April 17.</p>
      <p>Kemper joined the Confederate army receiving a comission as
         colonel of the 7th Virginia Regiment on May 2, 1861. He led
         his regiment with great skill and valor at First Bull Run and
         Williamsburg, which resulted in his promotion to brigadier
         general on June 3, 1862. Commanding a brigade in the Army of
         Northern Virginia, he fought in the Seven Days Battles, Second
         Bull Run (where he temporarily commanded a division),
         Antietam, and Fredericksburg. After serving with Longstreet's
         First Corps in North Carolina during the Battle of
         Chancellorsville, he rejoined Lee's army as a brigade
         commander for the Gettysburg campaign in Pickett's division.
         At Gettysburg, Kemper led his brigade in the ill-fated
         Pickett's charge of July 3, 1863, and was severely wounded and
         captured. Returned on a prisoner exchange in 1864, he was
         deemed unfit for futher field service, and was relegated to
         the command of the Virginia Reserves. Kemper was promoted to
         major general on September 19, 1864, and after Appomattox he
         was paroled by United States military authorities on May 2,
         1865.</p>
      <p>Kemper returned to his law practice and resumed his
         involvement in politics in Reconstrudction-era Virginia. He
         favored reconciliation with the north with an eye to
         rebuilding Virginia's shattered economy by attaching
         railroads, commercial business, and industry to the Old
         Dominion. At first he opposed the reign of the Republican
         Party under President Ulysses S. Grant, attending the 1860
         Democratic National Convention, and speaking for presidental
         candidate Horace Greeley in 1872. In 1873, with the support of
         General William "Billy" Mahone, the powerful postwar
         Conservative Party leader, Kemper captured the party
         nomination for governor, and won the ensuing election. His
         campaign made no attacks on the Grant administration, adopting
         a "wait-and-see" attitude. As John Scott wrote to Kemper on
         December 18, 1873 after taking to Grant, "when they have got
         the whites of Virginia as allies they can then let the negro
         go and will do it." Later, Kemper's support of Grant led to
         rumors of a Grant-Kemper ticket in 1876.</p>
      <p>As governor Kemper urged full civil rights and protection
         for the freedmen. Believing that the state should pay its
         debts, Kemper broke with Mahone and joined the "Debt-payer"
         faction in fighting the "Readjustors" or "Repudiators" in
         state politics. He also fought for a new constitution and the
         restoration of Virginia to normal relations with the United
         States. After his term as governor, he returned to his law
         practice, and died in April 7, 1985, in Orange County,
         Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection of James Lawsoon Kemper papers contains
         correspondence, business papers, and legal papers of James
         Lawson Kemper (1823-1895), lawyer, politicans, Confederate
         general, and governor of Virginia (1874-1877).</p>
      <p>The correspondence series spans the years in 1852 to 1895,
         with most material covering the years 1884-1889. A few letters
         pertaining to Kemper's service in the Confederate army as
         commander of the Virginia Reserves in 1864 regard measures for
         the storing of provisions in order to withstand the advancing
         Union armies under Ulysses S. Grant. Most of the letters refer
         to business conditions in Reconstruction Virginia, and
         Kemper's own business affairs and law practice. Two letters
         from William Mahone and Fitzhugh lee discuss state politics. A
         series of letters in 1888 and 1889 between Kemper and his son
         Heber concern Heber's unsuccessful search for employment in
         New York City and the search for Kemper's missing son James,
         rumored to have committed suicide. Kemper later attempted to
         collect on James' life insurance policy; however, young James
         finally turned up alive several years later and Kemper was
         forced to repay the insurance company. Included in the
         correspondence series are letters from Kemper's son-in-law
         John P. Thompson, who later turned Kemper's home, Walnut
         Hills, into a summer resort.</p>
      <p>The series of business papers, dating from 1840 to 1891,
         includes bills, receipts, tax records, land surveys, and
         checks. They are evidence of Kemper's desire to diversify his
         business interests after the war in an effort to achieve
         economic recovery. This series also includes some business
         papers belonging to Kemper's eldest son, Meade, a doctor.</p>
      <p>The legal papers series, dating from 1824 to 1892, includes
         deeds, bonds, court fees, licenses, and wills. Kemper buit a
         thriving law practice, doing most of his business in Madison,
         Orange, and Albemarle counties. Incuded are papers relating to
         Kemper's administration of the Thomas Shirley estate. The
         printed material section dating from 1864 to 1891, includes a
         Confederate war order and advertising broadsides.</p>
