      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Edwin Anderson Alderman (1861-1931) served as the President of three
                universities. The University of Virginia's Alderman Library is named after him, as
                is Edwin A. Alderman Elementary School in Wilmington.</p>
      <p>Alderman graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1882. He became a
                schoolteacher in Goldsboro, North Carolina, and then superintendent of the school
                district there.</p>
      <p>In 1891, Alderman and Charles Duncan McIver successfully pressed the North Carolina
                Legislature to establish the Normal and Industrial School for Women, now known as
                the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Alderman taught there until 1893,
                when he became a professor at the University of North Carolina; he was named
                president of that institution in 1896. He moved on to take the same position at
                Tulane University in 1900, before moving again to the University of Virginia in
                1904. There he stayed for 27 years, until his death in 1931 from a stroke in
                Connellsville, Pennsylvania, while en route to deliver a speech in Illinois. He is
                buried at the University of Virginia Cemetery.</p>
      <p>Alderman was a noted public speaker, and won fame for his memorial address for
                Woodrow Wilson, delivered to a joint session of Congress on December 15, 1924.</p>
      <p>In 1904, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia invited Alderman, then
                president of Tulane University, to become the first president of the University of
                Virginia. Since its founding in 1819, Mr. Jefferson's University had been governed
                by its Board of Visitors, but increasing discord between Visitors and the faculty,
                as well as the rising administrative burden of dealing with expanding academic
                departments and burgeoning student enrollments, led to the decision to move forward
                with the creation of the office of the president.</p>
      <p>Alderman was not the first choice for the new office. After considering other
                candidates, including Virginia Law graduate Woodrow Wilson, the Board of Visitors
                had first invited its former member George W. Miles, a colonel who had served on the
                staff of Virginia Governor James Hoge Tyler. The faculty opposed Miles' nomination
                and he was forced to withdraw. Other candidates were proposed, including Francis
                Preston Venable (who had succeeded Alderman as president of the University of North
                Carolina), but Alderman was unanimously chosen as the consensus candidate on June
                14, 1904. He began to serve in the fall of 1904 but was not formally inaugurated
                until April 13, 1905 (Thomas Jefferson's birthday, which was then as now celebrated
                as Founder's Day).</p>
      <p>The University changed in several significant ways under Alderman's guidance. First,
                he focused new attention on matters of public concern, creating departments of
                geology and forestry, adding significantly to the University Hospital to support new
                sickbeds and public health research, created the Curry School of Education,
                established the extension and summer school programs, and created the first school
                of finance and commerce at the school. He then restructured existing programs,
                separating the former "academic department" into the College of Arts and Sciences
                and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, in accordance with a growing move to
                standardize college educations by the Association of American Universities. The
                enrollment of the school greatly increased under his administration, as well, going
                from 500 regular session students in 1904 to 2,200 in 1929.</p>
      <p>Alderman also laid the financial groundwork for the University's future, during the
                first years of his presidency establishing its first endowment fund and leading the
                fundraising of almost $700,000 to meet a $500,000 challenge grant from Andrew
                Carnegie. By the end of his presidency the endowment would increase to $10
                million.</p>
      <p>He spent two-thirds of his long term at the University of Virginia physically
                disabled after a bad bout with tuberculosis.</p>

      <p>Speeches and addresses by Alderman form a large part of the collection and are in
                various stages of construction from notes, manuscripts, and typescripts, to a
                printed version, often printed in whole or in part in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The
                    Alumni Bulletin</title> or as a separate publication. Whenever possible, all
                versions of the same speech can be found together in a single folder under the date
                of the original speech even though the published version came later.</p>

                            liberalization of thought in North Carolina and methods of changing
                            attitudes to the outside world, particularly through the teaching of
                            history and economics, and Page's belief that the influence of "Dead
                            Men's Hands" or dead opinions lies too heavily upon the people, "the
                            weight of these mighty and invisible powers of the past - the dead part
                            of the past, not the part that ought to live &amp; be revered."

                            but it is struck through); congratulates Alderman upon his marriage and

                            President of the University of Virginia and urges him not to hesitate
                            but "Where Jefferson laid the foundations, go, you, &amp; build, if you

                            tuberculosis (December 9, 1912); mentions his impression of Woodrow
                            Wilson as President and [Frederick Taylor?] Gates, advisor to John D.
                            Rockefeller, who was developing 17,000 acres of land in North Carolina
                            and who said "he had left old Jno. D. for good" (December 9, 1912);
                            shares his hopes and fears for the Woodrow Wilson presidency, and writes
                            "but when this awful office descends on a man, it oppresses him, changes
                            him, you are not quite as sure of him, you doubt whether he knows

                            greetings on behalf of the Southern Education Board members,
                            particularly mentions Robert C. Ogden in his final stages of illness, as
                            Page reflects upon Ogden's involvement on the Board; he also praises the
                            work of Wicliffe Rose and his work on the eradication of hookworm
                            disease (January 26, 1913); mentions work on his farm in North Carolina
                            and shares his reassurance in government with the election of Wilson, "I
                            have a stronger confidence in government now as an instrument of human
                            progress than I have ever had before." (March 10, 1913); reveals that
                            President Wilson has appointed him as Ambassador to England (March 27,

                            writes concerning the Lusitania matter (May 12, 1915); writes a very
                            personal and revealing letter about his service as Ambassador to England
                            during World War I, "what the continent has already become - a bankrupt
                            slaughter-house inhabited by unmated women. We have talked of 'problems'
                            in our day. We never had a problem; for the worst task we ever saw was a
                            mere blithe pastime compared with what these women and the few men that
                            will remain here must face. The hills about Verdun are not blown to
                            pieces worse than the whole social structure and intellectual and
                            spiritual life of Europe. I wonder that anybody is sane." Page believes
                            the only answer is for the English-speaking men to work together to keep
                            the predatory peoples at bay, to exchange students between the
                            universities of the United States and Great Britain, casting aside the
                            medieval traditions of the English colleges, and to lead the rest of the
