         <p>Charles James Apperley (1778-1843), "Nimrod," was born at
         Plasgronow, near Wrexham, Denbighshire, second son of Thomas
         Apperley, tutor to Sir Watkin Williams Wynn. In 1790, Apperley
         entered Rugby and stayed until 1798; After leaving he became a
         cornet in Sir Watkin Wynn's Ancient Light British Dragoons, a
         regiment of fencible cavalry, with which he served in the
         suppression of the Irish rebellion. Returning to England in
         1801, he married Winifred, the daughter of William Wynn of
         Peniarth (the cousin of Sir Watkin), Merionethshire, and
         settled at Hinkley in Leicestershire. In 1804, Apperley moved
         to Bilton Hall, near Rugby, where he hunted with the Quorn,
         the Pytchley, and the Warwickshire hounds. From Bilton he
         moved in 1809 to Bitterley Court in Shropshire, and accepted a
         commission as captain in the Nothinghamshire militia, known as
         the Sherwood Foresters. Later he moved to Brewood in
         Staffordshire, and then to Beaurepaire House in Hampshire,
         where he lost much capital in farming experiments. His first
         paper in 
         <title render="italic">The Sporting Magazine</title>was an
         article about "Foxhunting in Leicestershire" in January 1822.
         Apperley continued a fruitful association with the magazine
         and its editor, John Pittman, until 1828, when he stopped
         writing for the publication. To escape disputes over his
         finances, connected with the settling of the Pittman estate,
         Apperley fled to Calais, France in 1830, where he became a
         regular member of the staff of the 
         <title render="italic">Sporting Review</title>. He also began
         a series of sporting memoirs and reminiscences, and in 1835,
         he published three articles, including "The Road," "Melton
         Mowbray," and "The Turf" in 
         <title render="italic"/>. Nimrod returned to England in 1842,
         dying in Upper Belgrave Place, Pimlico, on May 19, 1843.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection consists of the unpublished correspondence
         of Charles James Apperley ["Nimrod"] (1778-1843), primarily
         with John Pittman, editor of 
         <title render="italic">The Sporting Magazine</title>, and
         other members of the staff, and other papers pertaining to the
         magazine, bound into eleven volumes and containing ca. 1,043
         items, ca. 1797, 1818-1839, 1847-1851, and one volume of
         financial documents. Apperley is ranked as the greatest
         hunting correspondent of all time by A.H. Higginson in 
         <title render="italic">British and American Sporting
         Authors</title>.</p>
         <p>An experienced horseman, Apperley wrote his lively
         anecdotes and stories mainly for 
         <title render="italic">The Sporting Magazine</title>, the
         greatest sports journal of its day, from 1822 to 1828, under
         the pseudonym "Nimrod," reaching a large audience and
         providing an accurate picture of 19th century English sports,
         especially those of fox hunting and horse racing. Many of the
         letters in the collection deal with Apperley's often stormy
         relations with the magazine and its publisher; his financial
         difficulties despite constant loans and an ever increasing
         salary; his own personal horse-dealing interests, complaints
         about the quality of other writers' work; suggestions for
         raising the price of the magazine; details of his hunting
         tours, complete with expense reports; gossip; praise of
         himself and his popularity; suggestions for articles on cock
         fighting, fencing, pheasant breeding and others; and sprinkled
         throughout with names of royalty, nobility, and sporting
         personalities.</p>
         <p>Apperley's relationship with 
         <title render="italic">The Sporting Magazine</title>and its
         editor was extremely variable. During his tenure as hunting
         correspondent, the immense popularity of his reports of hunts
         and hunting men tripled the magazine's circulation. But his
         financial demands on the magazine's editor and owner John
         Pittman were so great that after Pittman's death on November
         27, 1827, the publication, burdened with debt, had to be sold.
         Apparently, Apperley moved to Calais, France, in November 1830
         (see volume seven, page 83) to avoid the importunities of the
         widow, Mary Ann Pittman, and the estate's executors, who were
         trying to recover money advanced to Apperley by Pittman and
         already spent.</p>
         <p>The collection consists of two distinct but intertwined
         groups of papers. One is the correspondence of Apperley,
         approximately 584 letters, signed, mostly to John Pittman, and
         after Pittman's death, to various individuals concerning the
         claims of his estate. Also present is a manuscript by
         Apperley, 
         <title render="italic">Road Work</title>, and two pages of
         corrected proofs, both in volume one. General subjects in
         these letters include: Apperley's comments about the quality
         of the reporting in 
         <title render="italic">The Sporting Magazine</title>which is
         lacking from "real practical observation"; an emphasis on his
         own qualifications as a sporting correspondent; his
         agricultural pursuits; innovative ideas like watering down
         race courses; potential subjects for articles such as
         cockfighting, angling, fencing, pheasant breeding, etc.;
         Apperley's various literary projects; details of hunting tours
         and expense reports; and constant financial appeals. The
         financial arguments continue after Pittman's death and
         Apperley's resignation from the magazine on October 10, 1828,
         well into the next decade.</p>
         <p>The second group contains 459 letters and documents
         concerning 
         <title render="italic">The Sporting Magazine</title>, and
         includes drafts of letters to Apperley, correspondence from
         the magazine's contributors, and legal documents detailing the
         confusion which affected the magazine after Pittman's death,
         partially attributable to Apperley's financial demands. Items
         include: expense reports, drafts of solicitors' letters, an
         enumeration of subscribers to reimburse Apperley for expenses
         incurred in his support of fox-hunting (1830 Apr 2), a letter
         from Lord Palmerston regretting that he could not stay a legal
         proceeding against Apperley (1824 Jun 23), correspondence to
         the staff of 
         <title render="italic">The Sporting Magazine</title>from
         attorneys, readers, potential correspondents, and two letters
         from R.S. Surtees about writing under another name.</p>

               deletions throughout, concerning "everything relating to
               working a coach through a country." Nimrod defines
               several of the technical terms, "working a coach is
               called horsing it," discusses considerations in horsing
               a coach, the division of the coach's earnings, the
               inequity of tolls paid by stage coaches compared to
               steamers, "so many of their old customers patronize the
               tea kettles and forsake the road," and praises the
               contributions of John Loudon McAdam to the betterment of
               British roads giving a brief history of his career.

               <title render="italic">The Sporting
               Magazine</title>offering to write for the publication
               and furnishing his qualifications, December 10, 1821, "I
               have long been a reader of your magazine and have for
               some time observed, in common with my friends, a great
               falling off in its contents, for the want of information
               derived from a proper source; that is to say - from the 
               <emph render="underline">real
               practical</emph>observation of one who witnesses and has
               witnessed the scenes which your work (to create the
               interest of your readers) ought to contain. .... With
               respect to my pretensions to your notice I have to
               observe that I have been an owner of race horses up to
               the present year, as also an attendant with [the] best
               hounds in all the celebrated counties up to the present
               season - have a large circle of sporting friends with
               whose private entertainments I am well acquainted, and
               my own connections in life are of the highest class." In
               his second letter to the magazine, December 12, 1821,
               Apperley continues, "I think I could materially alter
               the character of your work, and increase its sale very
               considerably by making it the vehicle for 
               <emph render="underline">that kind</emph>of information
               which is so much sought after in the sporting world -
               add to which, I know the private history of almost every
               man who is, or who has been, conspicuous amongst 
               <emph render="underline">us</emph>." A latter letter,
               October 16, [1822], in the same volume attacks one of
               his predecessors at the magazine, "My friend Corbet
               thinks old L[awrence] and his chaff sickened them [the
               readers] and certainly on looking over your kind present
               [past numbers of

               do find a great deal that had better been blown away.
               However, we must remember he has been an old servant,
               &amp; perhaps, once useful."</p>

               <p>Volume two, ca. 1823-1824, consists of 103 items and
               88 pages, and is as much concerned with Apperley's
               financial difficulties, his schemes for expanding the
               readership of 
               <title render="italic">The Sporting Magazine</title>,
               and his negotiations with John Pittman for an increase
               in salary or loans of money, as it is with authoring
               articles for publication. An example of this is a letter
               from Apperley to Pittman, August 5, 1823, where he is
               proposing new terms for his services, including
               agricultural articles, "This could enable me to keep one
               hunter, and go some way towards keeping a sort of a
               groom (one of all works) which would contribute not only
               to my comfort but 
               <emph render="underline">respectability</emph>, which
               should not be altogether lost sight of." He goes on to
               say that he must also have a pony for parcels, copies of
               the provincial papers, money to attend the principal
               agricultural fairs, and be recompensed for the money
               lost by having to keep his hunting horse at hand.

               <p>Volume three of the Nimrod letters, ca. 1824-1825,
               consists of ca. 84 items, and 75 pages. Apperley writes
               of his and Pittman's relationship, "I have often thought
               it was an evil day that brought you and myself together.
               Our whole career has been one of trouble, perplexity,
               &amp; everything unpleasant to our feelings as
               gentlemen" (n.d., page 20). In this volume, he also asks
               Pittman to release him from his contract, "I am getting
               very sick of labouring, as I have done these last few
               years, and doing myself no good. I have a great regard
               for you, but 'number one' will predominate" (n.y. May
               17, page 27).

               <p>Volume four of the Nimrod letters, ca. 1825-1826,
               consists of ca. 66 items, and 62 pages. Apperley writes
               about his relationship with Pittman, "I cannot conceive
               what you allude to in 'the tone of my letter.' I am not
               aware of having said anything that could have hurt your
               feelings - on the contrary, all I say, do, or think of,
               is for our 
               <emph render="underline">mutual</emph>interest" (page 3,
               [1825]). Apperley also assures him, "All my predictions
               will be verified and in another year or so, 
               <title render="italic">The Sporting Magazine</title>will
               be one of the most interesting periodical works going,
               and its circulation unbounded"(page 6). He reports to
               Pittman, "the whole county rings with the praises of
               Nimrod's second Tour. I told you how it would be!" (page
               19, [1826] Mar 5). Elsewhere Nimrod writes, "Indeed,
               from the beginning to the end, the work is worthy of the
               title it bears, and I assure you I feel an honest pride
               in the reflection that I have been so powerful and
               instrument in advancing it to its present
               respectability" (page 51, [1826]). Apperley discusses
               his financial difficulties, "Had these difficulties been
               brought on me by extravagant living, or any other
               misconduct, I could not hold this language to you; but
               this has not been the case. I have barely allowed myself
               the necessaries of life, and have been guilty of no
               extravagance. My debts have been contracted by my
               connection with your work" (page 58, [1826?]).

               consists of 102 items, and 76 pages. In this volume his
               financial difficulties and complaints continue,
               "Whatever my future fate may be, I shall have this to
               console me - I have exerted myself 
               <emph render="underline">to the utmost</emph>- nay
               indeed, to the manifest injury to my health for the
               well-doing of the magazine and I have done what no other
               person could have done for its advancement. I may say
               still more that nothing but a personal regard for
               yourself would have, under existing circumstances, kept
               me to the collar as long as I have been at it" (page 1,
               1827 Jan). He continues, "Altercation you say is
               unnecessary and I see no reason for it. The world will
               of course know what has [dissolved?] our contract, and I
               think it will say there was nothing unreasonable in my
               demand, which would give me a year to endeavor to write
               myself out of debt, and the produce of my pen to go to
               the Magazine. If I am to work hard, and get poorer every
               year, it shall not be my fault if I don't 
               <emph render="underline">try</emph>to remedy the evil"
               (page 23, 1827 June 30).

               <p>Volume six contains letters from Apperley, most
               following the death of John Pittman, ca. 1824-1828, 83
               items, and 79 pages, chiefly to and from Mr. Henry
               Crawter, the executor of Pittman's estate and
               representative for Mrs. Mary Ann Pittman in her dealings
               with Apperley, and including several letters to William
               Young and D.N. Shuey. In a letter to Crawter, Apperley
               writes, "I have always been a great admirer of women in
               certain situations and places but in the way of business
               I abhor them. They are, for the most part, suspicious,
               illiberal, and see no further than the present moment;
               so that on the present occasion I must look to 
               <emph render="underline">you</emph>to arrange matters in
               Warwick Square" (page 2, 1827 Dec 21). To the editor of 
               <title render="italic">The Sporting Magazine</title>,
               William Young, Apperley threatens to quit, "I am quite
               prepared for consequences, and having lost the tie that
               has hitherto bound me to the task - I mean a strong
               personal regard for Pittman - I care not how soon I quit
               an occupation that has never put a shilling into my
               pocket, but has fixed me with the charge of taking it
               out of that of others" (page 10, 1828 Jan [28?]). Nimrod
               also observes, "I understand when Mrs. P. speaks of me -
               It is 
               <emph render="underline">that fellow</emph>" (page 13,
               [1828 Jan]). For another letter mentioning his
               relationship with Mrs. Mary Ann Pittman see page 53,
               July 7, 1828.

               <p>The draft of Apperley's "advertisement" concerning
               his retirement from 
               <title render="italic">The Sporting
               Magazine</title>reads as follows, "Never having had much
               relish for Hampshire hunting, and being unable to afford
               to go from home for better, I have determined on
               retiring from the field. Under such circumstances, it
               would be presumptuous in me to continue to write in 
               <title render="italic">The Sporting
               Magazine</title>under the imposing signature of Nimrod.
               I therefore think it proper to state, that nothing in
               that work in future will proceed from my pen, with the
               exception of two more letters, concluding the Yorkshire
               Tour which shall appear at my earliest convenience"
               (page 15, 1828 Jan 31).

               Oct [8]) and "I have run my eye over the last double

               exceptions, such low life trash was never foisted on the

               <p>Volume nine consists of 116 items, 97 pages, ca.
               1822-1830, including correspondence, accounts, receipts,
               and legal documents concerning the settlement of the
               John Pittman estate, the business of 
               <title render="italic">The Sporting Magazine</title>,
               and questions concerning the contract and the employment
               of C.J. Apperley. The rupture in relations between Mrs.
               Mary Ann Pittman's representative and the executor of
               the estate, Henry Crawter, and Apperley is shown in his
               letter of October 6, 1831 (page 18), "All your spouting
               about the Magazine a fraud on the public is not worth
               answering. Your last letter to me was a most insulting
               one and this a tissue of misrepresentation which I
               flatly say is not true and when insulted you will find I
               can kick. I must now say I do not intend to waste my
               time in again writing answers to your misrepresentations
               and repeat what I said in my last that your threats and
               daring I hold in sovereign contempt." For additional
               letters from Crawter to Apperley about their
               disagreements over his contract and payments see the
