      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>James Rogers McConnell was born in Chicago, Illinois, on
         March 14, 1887, one of three children of Samuel Parsons and
         Sarah Rogers McConnell. The elder McConnell practiced law in
         Chicago from 1872-1889, and served as Judge of the Cook County
         Circuit Court from 1889-1894. After an interval of private
         practice, he moved to New York City, where he served as
         vice-president and counsel of the George A. Fuller Company
         until his retirement in 1904.</p>
      <p>The younger McConnell grew up in Chicago and New York City.
         He gained a certificate from the Haverford School in
         Pennsylvania before entering the University of Virginia in
         1907. He spent two years in the College and a year in the Law
         School, withdrawing from his studies in the spring of 1910.
         While at Virginia, Jim McConnell held memberships in Beta
         Theta Pi, Theta Nu Epsilon, O.W.L., T.I.L.K.A., and the German
         Club. He was King of the Hot Feet, Editor-in-Chief of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Corks and Curls,</title> Assistant Cheer Leader, and President of the Aero
         Club, which he had helped to found. His bonhomie and
         bagpipe-playing gave rise to fond memories among his college
         contemporaries.</p>
      <p>After several years in business in New York and in
         Carthage, North Carolina, where he served as land and
         industrial agent for a small railroad, McConnell sailed from
         New York with a friend in January 1915, to enlist in the
         French service. Through the spring and summer of 1915 he drove
         for Section "Y" of the American Ambulance, in the thick of the
         fighting on the Western Front, around Pont-à-Mousson and the
         Bois-le- Pretre. He was cited for conspicuous bravery and
         awarded the Croix de Guerre. Some of his
         letters from the period were edited and published in the
         September 15, 1915 issue of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Outlook,</title> with an introduction by former president Theodore
         Roosevelt, a strong advocate of preparedness.</p>
      <p>A deepening conviction of the rightness of the French cause
         led McConnell to volunteer for service in French aviation. He
         trained at the flying school at Pau and was breveted for
         flight on February 6, 1916. On April 20, 1916 he joined the
         newly-formed American Escadrille (later redesignated the
         Lafayette Escadrille) at its operational base at
         Luxeuil-les-Bains, becoming one of the first four of the seven
         original Escadrille pilots to arrive. He participated in the
         squadron's first patrol on May 13, 1916, and in the aerial
         actions during the great German offensive at Verdun in June
         and the Allied counteroffensives in July and August. On July
         1, 1916, he was promoted to sergeant, the rank which he held
         until his death.</p>
      <p>A back injury received in a landing mishap in August 1916
         near the squadron field at Bar-le-Duc forced McConnell's
         hospitalization in September. Although he rejoined the
         squadron at Cachy briefly in November 1916 and again at
         Ravenel in March 1917, his health never returned to normal.
         While convalescing, he busied himself with writing, and
         produced articles for <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">World's Work</title> magazine that were published in November 1916 and
         March 1917, and in book form as <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Flying for France</title> which appeared in April 1917, shortly after his
         death. He also was best man for his friend, Paul Rockwell, the
         squadron's historian and publicist, at the latter's Paris
         wedding on December 4, 1916.</p>
      <p>McConnell was killed in aerial combat with two German
         planes, above the Somme battlefields, near the village of
         Flavy-le-Martel, Aisne, on March 19, 1917. He thereby became
         the last American pilot of the squadron to die under French
         colors, before American entrance into the war in April 1917.
         His body was laid to rest where he fell, and was later
         re-interred at the Lafayette Escadrille memorial near Paris in
         accordance with his father's wishes. McConnell was
         memorialized with a plaque from the French government and a
         statue by Gutzon Borglum at the University of Virginia, and
         with an obelisk on the court square of his home town of
         Carthage, North Carolina.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The 
          James Rogers McConnell Memorial
         Collections consist of ca. 220 items, (1915-1917)1977, chiefly
         ca. 160 letters, 1915-1917, written by the University's famed
         aviator of the 
          Lafayette Escadrille to his friend, 
          Paul Ayres Rockwell and to Mademoiselle 
         <persname normal="Marcell Guerin">Marcelle
         Guérin</persname>, a French nurse serving at the
         hospital in 
          Paris, France during World War I. The
         letters date from 1915, when McConnell served with the
         American Ambulance on the Western Front in France, through
         1916, the year of the formation of the Escadrille, with
         McConnell as one of its original seven American pilots. They
         provide a vivid picture of McConnell's service in the cause of
         France, first as a non-combatant and then as a combatant.
         Included are accounts of his ambulance patrols (May-June,
         1915) and nearby bombardments while serving on the Western
         Front, where he earned the 
         <emph render="italic">Croix de Guerre</emph>for exceptional
         bravery under fire. Other events discussed are his first
         flight in a "Baby" Nieuport (May 20, 1916); the patrol of June
         1, 1916 after which McConnell crashed during a landing attempt
         (June 3, 1916); his convalescence from back injuries received
         in a later crash (August-September 1916); and his role in Paul
         Rockwell's Paris wedding (November-December 1916).</p>
      <p>There are also photographs and printed items pertaining to
         McConnell. There are photographs and printed information on
         McConnell's grave and other monuments to his memory. Items of
         interest include the proof copy of the authorized English
         translation (1919), published only in significantly altered
         form, of the account of the Lafayette Escadrille written by
         its French captain, 
         <persname normal="Georges Thenault">Georges
         Thénault</persname>. The volume, inscribed
         personally by Thénault to Paul Rockwell, has been
         returned to the owner and placed on microfilm for the use of
         researchers.</p>
