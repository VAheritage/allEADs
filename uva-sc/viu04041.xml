            <p>Edward R. Stettinius, Jr. (1900-1949), was an American industrialist and
                public servant and the Secretary of State in President Franklin Roosevelt's Cabinet.
                He was born in Chicago, Ill., on Oct. 2, 1900 to Edward Reilly and Judith
                (Carrington) Stettinius. His mother was a Virginian of colonial English ancestry and
                his father was of German descent, and a native of St. Louis who worked for
                financier, J. P. Morgan.</p>
            <p>Stettinius, Jr. received his education at the Pomfret School and the University of
                Virginia although he did not graduate. In 1924 he joined the General Motors Company
                as a stock clerk at 44 cents an hour. On May 15, 1926, he married Virginia Gordon
                Wallace, daughter of a prominent family of Richmond, Virginia. They had three
                children: Edward Reilly, and twins Wallace and Joseph. In 1931 he became Vice
                President in charge of public and industrial relations at General Motors. He worked
                to develop unemployment relief programs and came into contact with Franklin D.
                Roosevelt, for whom he worked briefly in the National Recovery Administration. In
                1934 he became chairman of the finance committee of the U.S. Steel Corporation, and
                in 1938 he became chairman of the board. Two years later he became head of the
                Lend-Lease aid to the allies, a position he held until he became undersecretary of
                state. In October 1943 Stettinius succeeded Cordell Hull as Secretary of State. In
                this capacity he undertook a reorganization of the department, sought to bring it
                into closer relations with other parts of the government, improved the relations of
                the department with the public at large, and labored vigorously in the creation of
                the United Nations. In the winter of 1945 Stettinius accompanied President Roosevelt
                to the Yalta Conference in the Crimea, at which the Big Three, Roosevelt, Winston
                Churchill of England, and Joseph Stalin of the U.S.S.R., attempted to plot the
                future course of international affairs.</p>
            <p>As Secretary, Stettinius made the decision to return a Russian codebook, found in
                Finland, to the Soviet Union. This hampered efforts of the United States to decode
                Russian cables, many of which, when later released, provided information about the
                widespread penetration of Soviet agents into senior United States Government
                positions. The reasons for this act are not clear. Soon afterward, Stettinius
                resigned as Secretary of State to become the first United States Ambassador to the
                United Nations. Stettinius resigned from this position in June 1946, after which he
                became critical of what he saw as Truman's refusal to use the United Nations as a
                tool to resolve tensions with the Soviet Union.</p>
            <p>For three years after his return to private life he served as rector of the
                University of Virginia. A longtime friend of William Tubman,, the president of
                Liberia, he helped form (1947) the Liberia Company, a partnership between the
                Liberian government and American financiers to provide funds for the development of
                that African nation. He lived during his retirement at his estate, Horseshoe Farm on
                the Rapidan River, Virginia. He died of a coronary thrombosis at the home of a
                sister in Greenwich, Connecticut, at the age of 49, and was buried in the family
                plot in Locust Valley Cemetery, Locust Valley, New York.</p>
