      <p>John Daniel Imboden was born in Augusta County, Virginia,
         in 1823, the son of George and Isabella Imboden. Imboden
         attended Washington College for two years, then taught school
         and later practiced law in partnership with William Frazier in
         Staunton, Virginia. When Frazier gave up his law practice in
         order to take charge of the Rockbridge Alum Springs, Imboden
         entered into partnership with John Howard McCue. During this
         time, Imboden was a leader of the Democratic party in his
         district and served in the Virginia House of Delegates during
         1850-1852 and 1855-1856. He was subsequently elected clerk of
         the County Court of Augusta in May 1857, and also served as
         district deputy of the Grand Lodge of Freemasons of
         Virginia.</p>
      <p>In 1859, during the John Brown raid, Imboden organized the
         Staunton Artillery as a volunteer company, which he later
         commanded at the capture of Harper's Ferry and battle of
         Manassas in 1861. During the latter half of the Civil War,
         Imboden served primarily in the [Shenandoah] Valley and West
         Virginia.</p>
      <p>After the war, Imboden turned his interests toward the
         development of mineral lands in southwest Virginia. He
         attempted to interest northern and foreign investors in his
         mineral and railroad development projects, traveling to London
         in 1873 for this purpose. Imboden died in 1895, having spent
         the last twenty years of his life in southwest Virginia where
         he helped found the towns of Big Stone Gap and Damascus
         (formerly Mock's Mill).</p>
      <p>Imboden was married five times, to Eliza Allen McCue
         (1824-1857, m. June 26, 1845); Mary Blair McPhail (1833-1865,
         m. May 12, 1859); Edna Paulding Porter (1841-1870, m. October
         2, 1866); Annie Harper Lockett (1851-1888, m. March 15, 1871);
         and Florence (Johnson) Crockett (1852-1908, m. May 22, 1890).
         Imboden had nine children -- Jane Crawford (1847-1930),
         Isabella (1849-1852), Martha Russie (1852-1930), Frank Howard
         (1855-1915), George W. (1857-1862), Nannie Carrington
         (1860-1947), Mary Wilson (1861-1862), John Daniel (1863-1877),
         and Helen McGuire (1874-?).</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection is comprised of ca. 3500 items (7 Hollinger
         boxes, ca. 3 linear shelf feet), (1831-1895) 1937, generated
         by John Daniel Imboden (1823-1895) of Staunton and Damascus,
         Virginia. The collection includes Imboden's correspondence
         with business associates and family members; financial and
         legal papers, some of which are related to Imboden's legal
         practice in Staunton, Virginia; manuscripts of articles and
         speeches by Imboden; galley proofs of his report to the Bureau
         of Statistics on industry, commercial and transportation in
         Virginia; printed reports and pamphlets regarding inventions
         and mineral resources; newspaper clippings, some of which are
         articles written by Imboden; and drawings of buildings and
         mechanical inventions by Imboden.</p>
      <p>The correspondence, (1844-1895) 1937, is primarily between
         John D. Imboden and his business associates and family
         members. The nature of the correspondence varies through the
         years because Imboden did not return to his legal practice
         after the Civil War. From 1844 to 1860, Imboden's business
         correspondence deals primarily with his legal practice in
         Staunton, Virginia, where he was first a partner of William
         Frazier and later of John Howard McCue. Most of this
         correspondence dealing with other legal matters, such as land
         deeds and wills. Among Imboden's business correspondents
         during these years were Claudius Crozet, Jedediah Hotchkiss,
         and John Letcher. There are also several letters written in
         1847 and 1848 by Chapman Johnson , Jr. a member of the
         Virginia House of Delegates, to Imboden regarding politics and
         business matters. Several letters written by Imboden while he
         was a member of the House of Delegates, 1850-1852, and
         1855-1856, are also included. Some of the letters during 1852
         to 1853 concern the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the
         Blind at Staunton. Also present in the pre-1860 correspondence
         are several personal letters from Imboden to his first wife,
         Eliza Allen McCue and a letter from John B. Floyd of the War
         Department, to Imboden, dated January 16, 1860, following the
         organization of Staunton Artillery by Imboden during John
         Brown's raid in 1859.</p>
      <p>The collection contains very little Civil War
         correspondence. Letters specifically related to Imboden
         participation in the Civil War include the following: George
         W. Randolph, Secretary of War for the Confederacy to Imboden,
         May 7, 1862; and Robert E. Lee to Imboden, October 6, 1862
         (photostat). A transcript of the war diary of his brother,
         Capt. Frank M. Imboden, for 1862-1863, is in Box 5.</p>
      <p>Imboden's business correspondence from 1865 until his death
         in 1895 reflects his role in the development of railroads and
         mining of mineral resources, primarily in southwest Virginia,
         and the development of his various mechanical inventions,
         including the electric street car. Imboden's major business
         correspondents include Frederick William Holliday; Major [John
         Howard] McCue; M.B. Wood; firms in Pittsburgh and
         Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Alexander H.H. Stuart; E.K.
         Hyndman; James L. Kemper; Andrew Rogers; and the Gauley
         Kanawha Coal Co. Of London, England. A few letters appear from
         such correspondents as Horace Greeley, John Tyler, Jr., Henry
         Mason Matthews, governor of West Virginia, and David Thomas
         Anstead, a British geologist. Also included is a letter from
         Henry Bergh, founder of the SPCA, who believed that Imboden's
         design for an electric street car would end the abuse of work
         horses in large cities. Some of Imboden's correspondence from
         November 1875 to 1876 concerns an alleged attack by Bradley
         Johnson on Imboden. A large part of the correspondence during
         1875-1876 concerns Imboden's role as a commissioner of the
         International Exhibition of the United Stated Centennial
         Commission, held in Philadelphia in 1876. Correspondence
         during 1886 and 1887 is largely with William Switzler, chief
         of Bureau of Statistics, Treasury Department, regarding
         Imboden's report on the mineral resources of Virginia. After
         1888, Imboden's business correspondence is chiefly concerned
         with his position as the general manager of Damascus
         Enterprise Co. in Damascus, Virginia.</p>
      <p>Imboden's personal correspondents after the Civil War
         include his fourth wife, Annie Harper Lockett (1851-1888); his
         fifth wife, Florence Johnson Crockett (1852-1908); his son,
         Frank Howard Imboden; his daughters, Martha Russie and Helen
         McGuire; and John Letcher. The correspondence contains family
         news as well as mention of Imboden's business affairs. Letters
         from Frank Howard Imboden, 1886-1892 (ca. 11 items), concern
         his work for a mining company in Honduras. The letters
         primarily relate to business matters, but some mention is made
         of the international affairs and activities of the Honduran
         people. Correspondence between John Letcher and Imboden after
         the war concerns Civil War history. One of these letters,
         April 20, 1877, with an 1864 newspaper clipping enclosed,
         describes the burning of Letcher's home in Lexington,
         Virginia, by Union troops. In addition, some of the
         correspondence between McCue and Imboden concerns Civil War
         history, including a letter dated February 3, 1883, regarding
         the historical accuracy of John Lewis Peyton's history of
         Augusta, Georgia. Peyton served as purchasing agent for North
         Carolina in England during part of the war. Also present in
         accession number 2983-a are several letters to Frank M.
         Imboden, brother of John D. Imboden.</p>
      <p>Correspondence dated after 1895 is between members of
         Imboden's family and mainly regards Imboden's participation in
         the Civil War and his business accomplishments.</p>
      <p>Imboden's legal and financial papers date from 1831-1895
         and reflect the changes in Imboden's career. Papers dated
         before the Civil War pertain primarily to the legal and
         financial problems of Imboden's clients in his law practice.
         Since most of these legal problems involved overdue accounts,
         numerous receipts and accounts of his clients are included in
         this section. Also included are land deeds, stock certificates
         in railroad and mining companies, articles of agreement, and
         summonses. Post-1865 legal material contains numerous patents
         for mechanical devices invented by Imboden. Fourteen bound
         volumes, 1841- 1893, complete the financial and legal papers.
         The earliest bound volume, 1841-1844, contains accounts,
         reports, and inventories of the Virginia Institution for the
         Education of the Deaf and Dumb and of the Blind, Staunton,
         Virginia. Other volumes include Imboden's cashbooks, which
         contain daily financial records of travel, building materials,
         and accounts. Two volumes contain records of legal cases
         handled by Imboden while practicing law in Staunton.</p>
      <p>The third group of papers, 1876-1886, n.d., consist of
         numerous articles, speeches, and notes written by Imboden
         regarding political issues, Civil War history, and the
         development of the railroad and mineral resources in Virginia.
         Also included in this section is the gallery proof of a report
         for the Bureau of Statistics, U.S. Treasury Department,
         written by Imboden.</p>
      <p>The printed material section, 1876-1896, n.d., contains
         magazine articles, pamphlets, reports, and newspaper clippings
         regarding Civil War history, and the development of coal
         mining and the railroad in southwest Virginia.</p>
      <p>Photographs of the interior and exterior of Imboden's home
         in Staunton, Virginia, and numerous drawings of Imboden's
         various mechanical inventions complete the collection.</p>
