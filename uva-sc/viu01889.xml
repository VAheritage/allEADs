      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>In at least one sense bibliography did not begin at home
         for the 
         <extref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/bsuva/sb/index.html"><corpname>Bibliographical Society of the University of
            Virginia</corpname></extref>, for the Society has never maintained a complete
         list of its own publications. The fullest record of what in
         fact has been the Society's chief activity in its first
         half-century can be found in the annual listings published in 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Studies in Bibliography</title></bibref>, beginning with its initial volume. A number of
         other sources help to amplify that history. In 1979,
         stimulated by a gift of Society publications from William B.
         O'Neal, a former councilor of the Society, the 
         <corpname>Rare Book Department of the University of Virginia
         Library</corpname>attempted to gather all such books and
         pamphlets and thereby establish a formal record of them; this
         collection is important as a focused attempt to provide a
         comprehensive account, but it falls short of completeness even
         for the first thirty years of the Society, and it was never
         developed for subsequent ones. For at least half of its life
         the Society has maintained a card file listing its
         productions, while the volumes the Society has accumulated in
         its office have over the years assumed the status of a
         reference collection and sometimes provide the sole evidence
         of an item's existence. The collections of individuals
         likewise prove to be important resources for piecing together
         the Society's work as a publisher; these in turn are indebted
         to booksellers particularly those in Charlottesville, who are
         foremost in recycling the accumulations of early Society
         members. Some documentary materials about the publications
         also exist: sporadic holdings of invoices and correspondence
         in Society files, references in the 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Secretary's News Sheet</title></bibref>or in irregular runs of Society minutes, and the
         papers of the Society's chief founders. Linton Massey's
         records were conveyed to the Society on his demise; the
         Society materials that John Cook Wyllie and Fredson Bowers had
         in their possession at the time of their deaths passed with
         other papers to the 
         <corpname>Special Collections Department of the University
         Library</corpname>(thus accounting for the presence of one of
         the Society's ledger books there instead of with the others in
         the Society office). It is appropriate that a record of a
         bibliographical society's publications therefore depends on
         representatives of its chief constituencies: private and
         institutional collectors, individual scholars and scholarly
         organizations, archivists, and booksellers.</p>
      <p>In the following list, two major series, the 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Secretary's News Sheet</title></bibref>and 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Studies in Bibliography</title></bibref>, are listed separately from the Society's other
         publications. Because the 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">News Sheet</title></bibref>is not widely known and has not been covered by
         indexes, I have noted those contents that have general
         bibliographical interest. The News Sheets that were devoted to
         a single topic were sometimes sold separately (and frequently
         appear in book dealers' catalogs without identification as
         part of the series); I have listed these both with the 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">News Sheets</title></bibref>, where the fuller information appears, and with the
         general publications. Especially during its first decade the
         Society made available to members various items which
         technically were not its own productions. Some of these bear
         such a close connection to the Society, however, that they
         merit inclusion; accordingly, they have been alphabetized with
         the other entries for the appropriate years (1947, 1949, 1952,
         and 1965), but they have been enclosed by braces. Unless
         otherwise indicated, the publications are hardbound, without
         dust jackets. Paperbound publications are described as in
         "covers" (that is, separate pieces of paper, usually thick) or
         in "wrappers" (a single piece of paper, occasionally thick,
         continuous around the spine).</p>
      <p>In its first fifty years the Society has produced 53 issues
         of its 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Secretary's News Sheet</title></bibref>, 50 volumes of 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Studies in Bibliography</title></bibref>(and reprints of 20 of them), and about 175 other
         publications. Though the amount of information available about
         the items varies, what is recoverable from archives and from
         the publications themselves makes clear the way in which the
         Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia has
         contributed to intellectual life in the second half of the
         twentieth century and why during that time the name Virginia
         became an international codeword for bibliographical
         study.</p>

                  the Lanston Monotype Machine Company of Philadelphia
                  in 1920. The type face was drawn from the 16th
                  century designs of Claude Garamond, and named for the
                  Latin form of the Frenchman's name. The type for the
                  book was keyboarded by Captain Horace F. Webb and
                  cast by Allen H. Kelly. The hand composition was by

                  cast on the Linotype by Heritage Printers, Inc. of
                  Charlotte, North Carolina. The typeface is
                  Baskerville, a design by John Baskerville
                  (1706-1775), English printer and typefounder.
                  Linotype Baskerville is a weight-for-weight and
                  curve-for-curve copy of Baskerville's celebrated
                  printing type. The pattern for the cutting was a
                  complete font of (approximately) 14 point, cast from
                  Baskerville's own matrices exhumed at Paris, France,
                  in 1929. The paper is 70-pound Warren's Olde Style,
                  an acid-free paper with a useful life of 300 years."
