      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection contains two sets of page proof, 1923, of
         "An apology for Boccaccio." One set of proofs on modern paper
         is corrected by Morley. A second set, presumably that of
         printer James S. Bates, is on 18th century paper obtained by
         James Shields for a limited edition of Morley's essay.</p>
      <p>With these are two sets of proof for Shields' editorial
         "Note" for the "Apology," one on modern paper with corrections
         addressed to Bates, and one on 18th century paper.</p>
      <p>Accompanying the proofs are a letter to Shields from Morley
         concerning the essay and a letter to Shields from Smart Set
         Company, Inc., granting permission to reprint.</p>

            <p>By Christopher Morley, apparently the printer's
                  (James S. Bates) own copy of a rare Morley item,
                  which was printed in an edition of eighteen copies on
                  18th Century handmade paper with an original deckle
                  edge obtained from booksellers Bernard S. Foster and
                  John Highlands in May 1922. The essay was originally
                  written while Morley was an undergraduate at Oxford
                  where it was read at a meeting of a literary club
                  called "The Midwives" in 1912. "The Apology for
                  Boccaccio" first appeared as an article in 
                  <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Smart Set</title>in 1916.
                  Morley was going to include the essay in 
                  <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Shandygaff</title>but withdrew
                  the corrected galleys before publication because he
                  felt it was too "juvenile." These galleys came to the
                  attention of James Shields, an editor at 
                  <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Evening Ledger</title>,
                  Philadelphia, in August 1919 where Morley wrote a
                  column under the by-line "Socrates." He left the
                  galleys with Shields who kept them until he could
                  find enough 18th Century paper to privately publish a
                  limited edition of the essay. This collection
                  includes two complete sets of page proofs, one on
                  very thin modern paper with Morley's corrections in
                  pencil and Shields' corrections in ink, and the other
                  on the 18th Century paper secured by Shields for his
                  limited edition.</p>
