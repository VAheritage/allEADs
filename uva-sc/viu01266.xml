      <p>John S. Crocker was born in 1825 (some sources say 1820) in
         Cambridge, New York. His family resided for six years in
         Fairfax County, Virginia until returning to New York. After
         reading law with a prominent local attorney Crocker practiced
         in Cambridge between 1849 and 1859. During the 1850s Crocker
         was elected to the House of Representatives of the state of
         New York (1856), became colonel of the 30th Regiment New York
         State Military Forces and apparently obtained the rank of
         general of militia. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War Crocker
         volunteered for duty and became the colonel of the 93rd
         Regiment New York State Volunteers (the Morgan Rifles), Army
         of the Potomac. During the 1862 Yorktown siege Confederate
         forces captured and imprisoned him in Libby Prison, Richmond,
         Virginia, and Salisbury Prison, North Carolina. Exchanged
         after four months' captivity (May-August 1862), he returned to
         duty and served until mustered out in September 1864 on a
         surgeon's certificate of disability.</p>
      <p>On March 13, 1865, he received a commission as brevet
         brigadier general for services during the war. General Crocker
         settled in Washington, D.C., and between 1867 and 1869 was
         elected to its board of common council and board of alderman.
         Appointed warden of the District of Columbia Jail in March
         1869 (a position which he held to his death), Crocker had
         charge over the execution of Charles J. Guiteau, assassin of
         President James A. Garfield. Crocker died on September 14,
         1890, in Washington, and was buried in Glenwood Cemetery.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of 30 items, 1843-1890, chiefly
         letters of John S. Crocker (1825-1890) of Cambridge, New York.
         Most of the letters present, accompanied by partial modern
         transcripts, were written by Crocker to his wife Harriet
         Sipperly Crocker (ten letters); Harriet's nine letters are
         addressed to her husband or members of her family. A few
         letters by other members of the Crocker family are also
         present.</p>
      <p>John and Harriet Crockers discuss local and family matters
         and express their love and devotion to each other. Items of
         interest include John's acceptance of Christianity (February
         15, 1843), a love poem by Harriet (October 8, 1843), her
         request for mailing envelopes (March 12, 1856), regimental
         orders to the 30th New York militia ordering its participation
         at an execution (November 10, 1858), a visit to Congress
         (March 3, 1859), John's reaction after his release from
         Confederate prison (August 20, 1862), antebellum visits to
         Langley, Falls Church and Fairfax County, Virginia (May 25,
         1851, March 3, 1859, February 20 and 23, 1860), and criticism
         of too many parties and balls in the midst of civil war (March
         20, 1864). Also present are three court documents concerning
         the administration of General Crocker's estate (1890),
         biographical sketches, and five empty postmarked envelopes.
         One of these, postmarked "Philadelphia/186?, Mrs. Harriet S.
         Crocker, Cambridge, Washington County, N. Y.," bears on its
         verso two illustrated advertisements of the Cooper Shop
         Volunteer Refreshment Saloon, Otsego Street near the Navy
         Yard, Philadelphia, J. Spittall, Engraver &amp; Printer, 409
         Chestnut Street, Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Prominent persons mentioned or referred to in the
         correspondence include Senator David Colbreth Broderick
         (1820-1859) of California, Brevet Brigadier General Ambrose S.
         Cassidy (?-?), General John A. Dix (1798- 1879), President
         Abraham Lincoln, (1809-1865), General George B. McClellan
         (1826-1885), Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton (1814-1869),
