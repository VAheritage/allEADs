      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The majority of this correspondence, 1917-1919, is from
         Dumas, Kemp, and Miles S. Malone to their mother, Lilian
         (Kemp) Malone, and pertains to their military service during
         World War I. In addition to the sixteen letters to their
         mother, there are three to their father, John W. Malone, three
         amongst themselves, and one to Sarah Heath Malone. There are
         also four letters, 1926-1953, of Kemp Malone while a member of
         the faculty at Johns Hopkins University. This correspondence
         complements a group of letters found in accession #10481.</p>
      <p>Letters from Dumas arrived from the Marine Barracks in such
         places as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Paris Island, South
         Carolina, and Quantico, Virginia. During this first year,
         Dumas wrote of his transfer to Company 3 Signal Battalion and
         learning the "signaling game," his training schedules, seeing
         a dreadnought in the harbor, his belief that his sister,
         Lillian, should be sent to Randolph-Macon Woman's College, and
         his first drill with rifles. There were few letters written by
         him in 1918, but he did mention the worst of training being
         over, receiving his "greens," and being squad leader of some
         50 men. Following a visit home, Dumas wrote an interesting
         letter on January 2, 1919, discussing the rest of his holiday
         in Lynchburg, Virginia and New York City. In Lynchburg, he
         visited Randolph-Macon, which he referred to as "a delightful
         place," and spent time with Dr. Webb and his family. The
         excitement over his trip to New York shows in his discussion
         of touring and talking with his brother Kemp and his friend
         Henry [Johnson] Toombs, who later became a renowned architect.
         He mentioned seeing the sites with "Henry pointing out a
         thousand small points of architectural beauty..." In the
         spring of that year, Dumas described a brief period of leave
         in Philadelphia and again wrote his belief of Randolph-Macon
         Woman's College being the best place for Lilian.</p>
      <p>As a member of the American Expeditionary Forces, Miles was
         sent to France and Germany after being trained in the Fourth
         Officers Training Camp at Camp Sevier, South Carolina, and
         Camp Gordon, Atlanta, Georgia. It is obvious from his letters
         that he was proud to serve his country, and, on seeing the
         troops bound for the front in July 1918, he referred to them
         as happy and cheering, exhibiting what he describes as the
         "spirit of the U.S. Army." By October 1918 he was bound for
         Europe to do some "real soldering"; the American ships were
         cheered along their route upon their arrival in France. He
         described the countryside of France as he saw it from the sea,
         and gave his impression of the people after landing. By
         December he was a member of one of the "American crack
         regiments on the field" in Germany, and told of their arrival
         by marching through northern France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and
         parts of Germany, and described the countryside and the
         people. An interesting letter of January 18, 1919 provides a
         lengthy description of a parade in which the colors of the
         23rd Infantry were decorated by the French in honor of the
         regiment's conduct at the Battle of Soissons. In February he
         wrote of having comfortable surroundings in the home of a
         German couple, traveling to Neuweid to a football game between
         the 1st and 2nd Divisions, and the rank of command in his
         regiment. A letter in April from Pleckhausen, Germany contains
         a description of the countryside and a tale of his patrol into
         the neutral zone. By this time he is looking forward to going
         home and receiving a "great welcome" from the American public,
         as they are anticipating peace in May.</p>
      <p>There are very few letters from Kemp during this period. In
         September 1918 he wrote from the Personnel Office about the
         family's move to Tennessee, one of his articles being
         published in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Modern Philology</title>, and not
         anticipating being sent overseas. And, in a letter dated
         "Wednesday," he wrote to his brother Miles concerning his (the
         former's) dilemma of accepting a National Guard comission as
         opposed to a National Army comission. In addition, there are
         three letters, 1948-1953, from Kemp to his mother, including
         some mention of his work as a philologist.</p>
