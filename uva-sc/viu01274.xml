      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The firm of the Stonega Coke and Coal Company was
         incorporated in 1902 to take over the work of the Operating
         Department of the Virginia Coal &amp; Iron Company, and
         beginning in 1915, underwent a decade of rapid expansion. A
         complete collection of the records of the Stonega Coke and
         Coal Company can be found at the Eleutherian Mills Historical
         Library, Greenville, Delaware (see #10516-a for a full
         description).</p>
      <p>The Virginia Coal &amp; Iron Company then became a land
         company, deriving its income from rents and coal royalties.
         The Stonega Coke and Coal Company was controlled by Dr. John
         S. Wentz and had many officers in common with the Virginia
         Company, but did not have identical stockholders and
         directors. Stonega remained the Virginia Company's principal
         operating lessee, also leasing its limestone quarry from
         1921-1950, and through a merger, was renamed the Westmoreland
         Coal Company in 1964. From 1902 to 1921, the Stonega Coke and
         Coal Company's Sawmill Department turned out construction
         lumber and mine props. The office of the Stonega Coke and Coal
         Company was located in the Minor Building in Big Stone Gap,
         Wise County, Virginia, which it leased from the Virginia
         Company after 1928.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a incomplete run of 32 Annual
         Reports of the Operating Departments, 1915-1957, (7 Hollinger
         boxes, 2.5 linear shelf feet), and about 280 glass plate
         negatives of various charts and maps used in the annual
         reports, and of safety warnings, ca. 1919-1939, pertaining to
         the Stonega Coke and Coal Company, a large Southern
         Appalachian coal producer, active in Lee County, and Wise
         County, Virginia.</p>
      <p>These are internal reports from the field to the main
         office in Philadelphia, which contained accounts of all
         activities of each department. Construction, output,
         technological change, wage scales, wholesale prices,
         recruitment of labor, accidents, legal cases, and medical
         statistics are all present. Many photographs, maps, plans, and
         drawings of all types of buildings and equipment are included.
         The officers for each year are listed in the beginning of each
         volume. Reports are given for the individual plants in Wise
         County, Virginia, at Stonega, Arno, Imboden, Osaka, and Roda,
         and in Lee County, Virginia, at Keokee.</p>
      <p>There are also two bound volumes of annual reports for the
         Crab Orchard Improvement Company, Eccles, Raleigh County, West
         Virginia, 1924-1925, present in the collection. Prior to 1924,
         the coal produced by the Crab Orchard Improvement Company was
         marketed by the Stonega Coke and Coal Company, but on January
         1, 1924, the General Coal Company became its exclusive sales
         agent.</p>
