      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection of 842 items, 1774-1891, n.d., consists of
         correspondence, business and legal papers, account books and a
         survey book belonging to various families. The material
         relates to the 
         <famname>Smith family</famname>of 
         <geogname>Staunton</geogname>, the 
         <famname>Lewis family</famname>of 
         <geogname>Sweet Springs</geogname>(now 
         <geogname>West Virginia</geogname>) and the 
         <famname>Cochran family</famname>of 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Staunton</geogname>.</p>
      <p><corpname>Folly Farm</corpname>was founded by 
         <persname>Joseph Smith</persname>in 1818 and is located about
         two miles south of 
         <geogname>Staunton</geogname>on Route 11. It has a serpentine
         wall which was designed by 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>.</p>
      <p>Correspondence of the 
         <famname>Cochran family</famname>is mainly concerned with
         family relationships. A few letters relate events in the Civil
         War. An October 17, 1861 letter speaks of an overcoat factory
         founded by 
         <geogname>Staunton</geogname>women. In a letter to 
         <persname>Maggie Cochran</persname>(July 1, 1862) the victory
         over McClellan at 
         <corpname>Frasyers Farm</corpname>is described. A letter to 
         <persname>Mittie Cochran</persname>(September 2, 1861)
         mentions an engagement near 
         <geogname>Fairfax</geogname>. 
         <persname>Joseph S. Cochran</persname>attended the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>and a letter from
         him (October 7, 1890) mentions his impressions of Professors 
         <persname>[Albert Henry] Tuttle</persname>and 
         <persname>[John William] Mallet</persname>.</p>
      <p>Letters between 
         <persname>John Lewis Cochran</persname>and his mother 
         <persname>Margaret Lynn (Lewis) Cochran</persname>deals
         chiefly with family matters. The letter of September 7, 1857
         mentions the status of their business operations. An
         interesting letter (June 27, 1848) gives a view of slavery and
         abolitionists. 
         <persname>Nannie Cochran</persname>'s death and its effects is
         mentioned in August 20, 1863.</p>
      <p>Letters between 
         <persname>Howe Peyton Cochran</persname>and his mother 
         <persname>Margaret Lynn (Lewis) Cochran</persname>are about
         personal affairs and the Civil War. The early letters concern 
         <persname>Howe Peyton Cochran</persname>'s attendance of the 
         <corpname>Hanover Academy</corpname>where he was very bored
         and often homesick except when he traveled to 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>. Some interesting Civil War
         letters are July 27, Sept 5, 14, &amp; 20, 1861. 
         <persname>Howe Peyton Cochran</persname>left the active
         service when a substitute was bought for him (May 23, 1862). A
         n.d. letter mentions 
         <corpname>Monticello hospital</corpname>being condemned due to
         Typhoid fever. The letter of August 16, 1863 mentions the
         deaths of 
         <persname>Nannie Cohran</persname>and 
         <persname>Maggie Cochran</persname>.</p>
      <p>Letters between 
         <persname>Willie Lynn Cochran</persname>and his mother 
         <persname>Margaret Lynn (Lewis) Cochran</persname>were written
         while 
         <persname>Willie Lynn Cochran</persname>attended school in 
         <geogname>Brownsburg</geogname>and mostly contain pleas for
         more letters from home.</p>
      <p>Letters between 
         <persname>Howe Peyton Cochran</persname>and his wife 
         <persname>Nannie L. (Carrington) Cochran</persname>(married
         December 18, 1860), written during the Civil War, are chiefly
         personal in nature but many contain a little information about
         the war. Some of the more important letters are as follows.
         His letter of January 5, 1861 describes the commanding
         officers of 
         <persname>Howe Peyton Cochran</persname>'s regiment ( 
         <corpname>1st regiment Virginia Artillery</corpname>) which
         included General Magruder, Colonels Sulakowski, 
         <persname>Tom Cobb</persname>, 
         <persname>Howell Cobb</persname>, Montagne, Ward, and Major
         Brown. Letters of December 8, 11, 13, &amp; 16 detail
         preparations for an attack that never occurred. Letters of
         February 24, 25 discuss the problems in the company and an
         expedition that did not start. The letters of March 1862 also
         give the problems of the company and preparations for a large
         battle near 
         <geogname>Yorktown</geogname>. The letters of April 1862
         contain references to the skirmishes occurring at 
         <geogname>Yorktown</geogname>. The letters of May 9 and 14,
         1862 gives a sketch of the battle of 
         <geogname>Williamsburg</geogname>which 
         <persname>Howe Peyton Cochran</persname>'s regiment did not
         participate in. Nearly every letter also contains a plan to
         get out of the service or at least out of his present company
         and into an office job: Some of the schemes include becoming a
         teacher at 
         <corpname>Randolph Macon</corpname>, becoming a clerk in the
         war department, or joining his brother 
         <persname>James Cochran</persname>'s unit. A son ( 
         <persname>Campbell Carrington Cochran</persname>, named for 
         <persname>Nannie Cochran</persname>'s brother who died during
         the war) was born on July 31, 1863, and 
         <persname>Nannie Cochran</persname>died, apparently as a
         result of complications from childbirth, on August 11,
         1863.</p>
      <p><persname>Joseph D. Cochran</persname>'s application for a 
         <corpname>University of Missouri</corpname>chemistry chair
         mentions his teachers (August 8, 1890) while at the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>and 
         <corpname>College of Richmond</corpname>. The letter of August
         21, 1890 states he received references from Professors 
         <persname>[John William] Mallet</persname>, 
         <persname>[Francis Perry] Dunnington</persname>, 
         <persname>[George Frederick] Holmes</persname>, and 
         <persname>[Ormond] Stone</persname>of the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>, Professor Puryear
         of the 
         <corpname>College of Richmond</corpname>, and his present
         congressman 
         <persname>[Henry St. George] Tucker</persname>.</p>
      <p>In Letters to 
         <persname>Campbell Carrington Cochran</persname>, two stirring
         accounts of the virtue of 
         <persname>Nannie Cochran</persname>and her death are given on
         the first birthday of 
         <persname>Campbell Carrington Cochran</persname>, July 31,
         1864.</p>
      <p>In Letters to 
         <persname>Henry Cochran</persname>family affairs are
         discussed. An October 11, 1862 letter mentions prices of basic
         foods and how the state is covered with blood, "Turn whichever
         way you may nothing meets your eye, but maimed and bleeding
         soldiers." A January 15, 1863 letter mentions the death of 
         <persname>Maggie Cochran</persname>from Typhoid Fever and
         pneumonia. On March 18, 1863, there is a reference to the
         battle of 
         <geogname>Culpepper</geogname>. A March 31, 1863 letter
         mentions houses and hospitals being destroyed to use the wood
         for fuel. An April 16, 1863 letter mentions the prices of
         food.</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>Howe Peyton Cochran</persname>contain more letters
         about family affairs. Howe was perusing a teaching job at 
         <corpname>Randolph Macon</corpname>and the letters of November
         20, &amp; 27, 1861 mention the peculiarity of the trustees who
         wished for their teachers to be Methodist and in the military.
         A letter of April 14, 1862 mentions the death of 
         <persname>Campbell Carrington</persname>( 
         <persname>Nannie Cochran</persname>'s brother) after the
         battle of 
         <geogname>Cournif</geogname>on April 11, 1862.</p>
      <p>Letters to Colonel and Mrs. 
         <persname>James C. Cochran</persname>include correspondence
         between their sons 
         <persname>John L. Cochran</persname>, 
         <persname>Joseph D. Cochran</persname>, and daughter 
         <persname>Anne Cochran</persname>who went to 
         <geogname>Gainesville, Florida</geogname>because of 
         <persname>John Cochran</persname>'s ill health in 1886. The
         letters give the progression of 
         <persname>John Cochran</persname>'s sickness which did not
         improve substantially and eventually caused his death in
         February 1887 after his return to 
         <geogname>Staunton</geogname>.</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>John Cochran</persname>contains an interesting
         letter (February 17, 1830) on the price and selling of
         hogs.</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>Margaret Lynn (Lewis) Cochran</persname>contain
         letters from her brother 
         <persname>Thomas Preston Lewis</persname>who served with the 
         <corpname>War Department</corpname>in the 1850's. There are
         two interesting letters: January 5, 1852 which mentions the
         visit of a Magyar to 
         <corpname>Congress</corpname>who apparently impressed
         everyone, and the concern of the American government over 
         <persname>Napoleon Bonaparte</persname>who was coming to power
         in 
         <geogname>France</geogname>; and, March 6, 1859 which mentions
         the factional wars going on in congress and the affect it had
         on the treasury.</p>
      <p>The first few letters to 
         <persname>Nannie (Carrington) Cochran</persname>are from
         relations and friends unable to attend her and 
         <persname>Howe Peyton Cochran</persname>'s wedding. The letter
         of June 10, 1861 is from 
         <persname>John Lewis Cochran</persname>and contains very
         interesting Civil War information, including the Union's
         treatment of prisoners.</p>
      <p>The letters to 
         <persname>Thomas Preston Lewis</persname>have been removed
         from a letter book containing mostly business letters. There
         is an index which has been placed at the back of the second
         folder. 
         <persname>Thomas Preston Lewis</persname>received the right to
         practice law in 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>on September 3, 1847. He received
         appointments in the 
         <corpname>census bureau</corpname>(October 8, 1850 -#48), and
         later the 
         <corpname>War Department</corpname>based on recommendations by
         <persname>Alexander Hugh Holmes Stuart</persname>(November 15,
         1850.) 
         <persname>Thomas Preston Lewis</persname>' ancestors fought in
         the battle of 
         <geogname>Point Pleasant</geogname>and an attempt had been
         made to have that battle declared the first of the
         revolutionary war (August 24, 1858 -#1). A no date letter (#8)
         contains an inventory of debts 
         <persname>Thomas Preston Lewis</persname>has at a store and
         gives prices. Letters of December 29, 1853 (#16 and #20) are
         introduction letters written by 
         <persname>John Buchanan Floyd</persname>. October 21, 1851
         (#48) is a letter from 
         <persname>William Sparrow</persname>. March 6, 1866 (#159)
         states that 
         <persname>Thomas Preston Lewis</persname>lost all land in the
         war and is now broke. Letters of February 14, 1866 (#161),
         January 21, 1867 (#162) concern 
         <persname>Thomas Preston Lewis</persname>trying to collect on
         his debts. 
         <persname>Thomas Preston Lewis</persname>attempted to have his
         political disability resulting from service with the
         confederacy removed (February 25, 1869 -#166, January 24, 1870
         -#174, January 29, 1870 -#175.) Apparently this attempt was
         successful because 
         <persname>Thomas Preston Lewis</persname>received help from 
         <persname>John F. Lewis</persname>in getting an appointment
         (October 6, 1869 -#169, March 29, 1870 -#183.) 
         <persname>John F. Lewis</persname>had assisted 
         <persname>Thomas Preston Lewis</persname>before getting him
         appointed as an assistant to the registrar in 1867 (September
         28, 1867 -#189.) December 23, 1869 (#168) is from 
         <persname>B. F. Ballard</persname>and mentions that he will
         call for a new 
         <geogname>West Virginia</geogname>constitution. Three letters
         concern the sale of land held in 
         <geogname>Iowa</geogname>which 
         <persname>Thomas Preston Lewis</persname>got from his debt
         collection (July 13, 1869 -#171, May 12, 1868 -#173, and July
         25, 1869 -#174.) An item dated April 20, 1871 (#180) is a
         notice placed by 
         <persname>Thomas Preston Lewis</persname>to bring all claims
         for the pensions of veterans of the War of 1812. An August 21,
         1871 (#196) letter contains an analysis of 
         <geogname>Rawley Springs</geogname>in 
         <geogname>Rockingham County, Virginia</geogname>. Letters of
         December 7, 1870 (#204,) February 4, 1873 (#204,) and December
         18, 1874 (#206) refer to 
         <persname>Thomas Preston Lewis</persname>starting and running
         a school for boys. The school must not have been too
         successful because the letters of November 12, 1873 and
         December 1874 (both #207) mention relatives sending what money
         they can to 
         <persname>Thomas Preston Lewis</persname>. On September 10,
         1874 (#209) there is an interesting letter on the 
         <geogname>Florida</geogname>school system.</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>Ann M. Peyton</persname>from her sister 
         <persname>Margaret Lynn (Lewis) Cochran</persname>mention the 
         <famname>Cochran family</famname>'s move from 
         <geogname>Staunton</geogname>to 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>(October 24, 1826.) A
         letter in June 1836 mentions the death of their sister
         Mary.</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>Joseph Smith</persname>contain many applications for
         loans. 
         <persname>Joseph Smith</persname>served in the 
         <corpname>General Assembly</corpname>from December 1, 1817 to
         February 26, 1818 (December 2, 1817.) There is a letter dated
         January 26, 1832 from 
         <persname>R. S. Brooke</persname>which concerns the debate in
         the 
         <corpname>General Assembly</corpname>over slavery and the
         conflict abolition has with personal property and
         compensation. An item of January 13, 1860 values the land held
         by 
         <persname>Joseph Smith</persname>to be $74,900.</p>
      <p>Letters to 
         <persname>Joseph Smith</persname>from 
         <persname>William Widdifield</persname>are mainly concerned
         with the collection of a debt from 
         <persname>David Paul Brown</persname>. A letter of March 3,
         1862 mentions 
         <persname>Joseph Smith</persname>'s brothers 
         <persname>Abraham Smith</persname>and 
         <persname>Silas H. Smith</persname>.</p>
      <p>Appointments contain some of the appointments and
         promotions of the families. 
         <persname>James Cochran</persname>was appointed justice of the
         peace in 
         <geogname>Augusta county</geogname>in 1798. There are 
         <persname>Joseph Smith</persname>'s military promotions while
         a member of 
         <corpname>Virginia's 32nd militia</corpname>. 
         <persname>James Cochran</persname>was appointed Postmaster of 
         <corpname>Folly Mills</corpname>in 1874.</p>
      <p>Business Papers contain bills, receipts and promissory
         notes. One bill of June 15, 1815 is from 
         <persname>Joseph Smith</persname>to the 
         <geogname>United States</geogname>for determining the number
         of taxable people and taxable items in 
         <geogname>Augusta county</geogname>; the total number of
         taxable people was 589. 
         <persname>Joseph Smith</persname>was a life member of the 
         <corpname>Virginia Agricultural Society</corpname>(October 11,
         1854.) Also there are five 
         <geogname>South Carolina</geogname>bonds issued after the
         Civil War, but never cashed in.</p>
      <p>Essays and Poetry include a poem lamenting the death of 
         <persname>Elizabeth Battaile Smith</persname>(November 17,
         1810), a poem about an insane hospital in 
         <geogname>Boston</geogname>(March 1830), an obituary of 
         <persname>Magdalene Crawford</persname>(May 21, 1849), and
         lecture notes to teach Physics (n.d.)</p>
      <p>French Spoliation claims represent the attempt to get money
         for the damages done by the French before 1800. The 
         <geogname>United States</geogname>, however, had exonerated
         the French from having to pay so many felt the 
         <corpname>Federal government</corpname>should pay the
         damages.</p>
      <p>Inventories of Debts due 
         <persname>Joseph Smith</persname>contain detailed lists of
         everyone and every business which owed 
         <persname>Joseph Smith</persname>money. The amounts were
         considerable, some reaching as high as $134,000.</p>
      <p>Legal documents contain mostly deeds and a few court case
         decisions.</p>
      <p>Slave Lists list all the slaves owned by 
         <persname>Joseph Smith</persname>and are divided into those
         which are hired out and those which remain at home. A n.d.
         item lists the amount spent on some of the slaves for
         Christmas gifts.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous material includes a confirmation certificate
         of 
         <persname>Ann (Price) Smith</persname>(June 5, 1811), lottery
         tickets (1812), report cards of 
         <persname>Campbell Carrington Cochran</persname>(1872), a
         survey attempting to promote the new South (1894), and
         business cards of 
         <persname>Joseph Smith</persname>and Dr. 
         <persname>Henry Cochran</persname>.</p>
