      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Dunn was born near Meadville, Crawford County, Pa. on
         September 9, 1826. He married Temperance Osborne at Hayfield,
         Crawford County, on October 15, 1849. The couple had four
         children -- Josephine A., James A., Jessie, and Gertrude.</p>
      <p>Dunn enlisted in the Union Army from Crawford County, Pa.,
         on April 16, 1861, as a Captain of Company D., Erie Regiment
         of the Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. He did not continue
         with the Company, however, as he was appointed Surgeon of
         Pennsylvania Volunteers with the rank of Major. For three
         years, he was Surgeon of the 109th Regiment. During service,
         he participated in engagements at Cedar or Slaughter Mountain,
         Va.; 2nd Bull Run, South Mountain, Antietam, Md.;
         Chancellorsville, VA.; Gettysburg, Pa.; Wauhatchie,
         Chattanooga, Lookout Mountain and Mission Ridge, Tenn. His
         12th Corps was consolidated with the 20th Corps, Army of the
         Potoma, which was engaged at Ringgold, Ga.; and other areas in
         Goergia including Mill Creek Gap, Peach Tree Creek, Resaca,
         Dallas or New Hope Church, Kenesaw Mountain, Pine Knob, Culpie
         Farm, Muddy Creek, and others and the Siege of Atlanta and
         March to the Sea at Savannah.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of letters from James Langstaff
         Dunn, a Brigade Surgeon to the 2nd Brigade, Banks Corp, 2nd
         Brigade, 2nd Division, 12th and 20th Army Corps, to his wife
         (with a few exceptions). It also includes a portfolio of his
         personal military and civil history.</p>
      <p>Dunn's letters are chiefly filled with news of family and
         friends. He describes camp life, food, marches, weather,
         illnesses among the troops, battles, treatment of the wounded,
         and his thoughts on the war. There is a gap in the letters
         between January and April, 1864, when Dunn was apparently at
         home on leave for several months.</p>

                  especially a dress whose material "is all the
                  fashion." The regiment was in the camp, but he
                  remained in the Mustering office. He discusses of the

                  Writes that for the past two weeks he has expected
                  her letter and is anxious for news from home,
                  especially concerning Freddy's cough, and mentions
                  that he sent Freddy a good suit of clothes. Dunn
                  writes he is happy to be surrounded by a loyal and
                  patriotic class of men and speaks passionately
                  against those "poor miserable wretches whose whole
                  soul is wrapped up in the miserable doctrine of human
                  bondage and in unison with Jeff[erson] Davis."
                  Although he confesses a respect for the Southerners
                  as a brave enemy, Dunn despises the "vile reptiles of
                  sympathizers at home who are giving aid and comfort
                  to the rebels" and speaks of himself as the enemy of
                  all traitors.</p>

                  march to Savannah which included the exodus of 20,000

                  and private property;" comments on the evils of
                  slavery and "the cruel lash of the slave driver in a
                  land that boasts of its extended freedom;" reports

                  conferred on the north that it should be so careful
                  as to foster and preserve it? It first placed
                  political parties almost in deadly conflict--it then
                  divided the nation and trampled on the Nation's most
                  sacred emblem--it's flag. The bloody battlefields
                  before Richmond, the long and wearisome marches
                  through the Valley of Virginia and the carnage of
                  Bull Run and Antietam which has carried mourning
                  throughout the whole north, dressed almost every
                  household in crape. Yet to attempt to destroy the
                  power that is doing all this is the rock on which our
                  people of the north disgracefully split;" Dunn
