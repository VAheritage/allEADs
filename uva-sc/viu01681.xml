      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This addition to the papers of Julien Green, a Parisian
         novelist of American parentage, is comprised of 12 autograph
         letters signed spanning 1927-1939 possibly to [Jacques Patin,
         an editor at Le Figaro] regarding publication of Green's
         personal journals in excerpts in the Paris newspaper Le Figaro
         and in book form. (The journals were ultimately published in
         1972 as Journal: 1926-1972, 9 vols., and partially translated
         in 1939 as Personal Record 1928-1939 and in 1962 as Diary
         1928-1957.) All the letters are in French.</p>
      <p>Green is initially resistant to the project: ". . .I have
         given much thought to your request, which is a great honor to
         me, but I don't believe, unfortunately, that I'm able to send
         you a paper that would satisfy both of us. I could, doubtless,
         write a page or two which we could call a summary, but neither
         you nor I would be happy with it. . ." (undated letter). But
         he soon complies: "I have been in bad health and preoccupied
         lately and haven't sent you anything, but I am in the process
         of finishing an article that you are going to receive from
         here in two or three days. . .[I] am going to publish my
         journal, or a part of my journal, towards the end of May. . .
         I will try to choose excerpts in a way of forming a homogenous
         whole. . ." (undated letter).</p>
      <p>Later letters include discussions of Green's growing
         enthusiasm for the project (22 May 1927 and 27 June 192[7?]);
         the importance of the printers following the corrected proofs
         carefully (". . .It's important that the words to omit
         completely disappear. . .I'm thinking in particular of the
         first page. . ."; undated letter); and the publication of
         excerpts in Le Figaro (3 May 1938, 29 March 1939).</p>
