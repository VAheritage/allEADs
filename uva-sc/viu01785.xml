         <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
         <p>Erb was born in 1901 in Pennsylvania. He graduated from
         Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1923, as a
         metallurgical engineer. During the next thirty years (ca.
         1928-1958) he worked for General Electric in Schenectady, New
         York, chiefly on military projects including the B-29 turret,
         the Polaris and Minuteman missles, and the Vulcan gun. From
         1958-1961 he was employed by the Aerojet-General Corporation
         near Sacramento, California, but he retired in 1961, settled
         in Northville, New York, and began writing what he called his
         "two little books," for which he was eventually unable to find
         a publisher.</p>
         <p>In 1966 Erb formed the Un-Political Party; after it failed
         to attract attention as a possible third party he joined the
         Libertarian Party in 1972. He worked for Libertarian
         candidates in local and state elections while continuing his
         correspondence with individuals and organizations concerning
         issues of the day. He was appointed party chairman for Fulton
         county by the Libertarian Party in 1974 but resigned at the
         end of the same year.</p>
         <p>Erb's family consisted of his wife Margaret and his sons
         John, a San Francisco pharmacist, and Wayne, a pilot for
         United Airlines.</p>

      <scopecontent>
         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The Erb Papers, 1962-1976, consist chiefly of political
         correspondence files of John E. Erb, a New York Libertarian
         Party member, in addition to printed materials, newspaper
         clippings, newsletters, and campaign literature.</p>
         <p>Erb wrote letters to many prominent individuals, including
         members of Congress; media personalities; magazine editors;
         local, state, and national officials; black leaders;
         evangelical leaders; and other Libertarians. The collection
         consists chiefly of the carbons of these letters and of
         letters he wrote in response to newspaper and magazine
         articles, and letters to newspaper editors which interested
         him. Often these letters urged the recipient to join the
         Libertarian Party. Noted individuals to whom Erb wrote include
         Edmund Muskie, Robert F. Kennedy, Eugene McCarthy, Robert C.
         Byrd, William F. Buckley, Jr., Milton Friedman, Gardner Ted
         Armstrong, Rev. Jesse Jackson, and John Chancellor. In most
         cases, Erb did not receive replies to his letters.</p>
         <p>Among the topics discussed are Libertatians' campaigns for
         office, taxation, strip mining, nuclear power, the Vietnam
         War, capital punishment, population control, and educational
         and military spending.</p>
         <p>Other items include issues of Libertarian newsletters such
         as 
         <title render="italic">LP News</title>and 
         <title render="italic">Free Libertarian</title>, circulars,
         news releases, and memoranda from Congressmen; miscellaneous
         writings by Erb; campaign literature for such Libertarian
         candidates as Roger MacBride, Jerome Tuccille, and Sanford
         Cohen; newspaper clippings; and miscellaneous printed
         material.</p>
      </scopecontent>
      <arrangement>
         <head>Organization</head>
         <p>As the papers had no particular arrangement when they
         arrived at the Library the correspondence was placed in
         chronological order. When items of varying dates were clipped
         or stapled together they were filed according to the date of
         the foremost item. Non-correspondence items such as newspaper
         clippings were left attached to the letters when they had been
         so filed.</p>
         <p>The correspondence is followed by several folders of
         printed material. Newspaper and magazine clippings have been
         organized into two separate folders: the first contains copies
         of some of Erb's letters to newspaper editors as well as
         clippings he annotated, and the second consists of
         miscellaneous clippings.</p>
