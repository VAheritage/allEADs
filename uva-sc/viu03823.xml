         <head>Scope and Content
</head>
         <p>This Thomas Jefferson memorandum book, 1767-1770, consists of three of four pocket notebooks and an almanac, formerly sewn together, containing both notes on legal cases and accounts of fees received, kept by
Thomas Jefferson while practicing law. This volume was lent to the Library of Congress in 1917, and remained there on loan for sixty-seven years. Probably about the time of World War II, the original binding
threads were removed, each page was inlaid in a quarto sheet, and silk was applied to either side of the large pages. The pages were then bound in a green leather binding. The volume contains 337 pages bearing
either manuscript or print; some of the printed pages were annotated by Jefferson.
</p>
         <p>The material in the memorandum book includes: cash memoranda, memoranda of facts, various actions which Jefferson is to take or has taken, fees received or paid, purchases, subscriptions Jefferson received as
agent for the <title render="italic">Virginia Gazette</title> and the <title render="italic">Gentlemen's Magazine</title>, Greek and Latin phrases, a plan for a reading desk, detailed specifications for a house
(probably "Monticello"), contents of Jefferson's wine cellar, specifications for a clavichord, measurements for a new canal, cash accounts, lists of balances due, and <title render="italic">The Virginia Almanack
for 1770</title>, in which Jefferson has marked the days during which various courts and the assembly met.
