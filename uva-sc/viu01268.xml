      <p>This is a 11-volume set of scrapbooks containing the
         autobiographical memoirs of Mary Victoria (Wesson) Craw (1908-
         ) of Charlottesville, Virginia, compiled during 1983-1992.
         Mrs. Craw was born in Springfield, Massachusetts and was
         educated at Bryn Mawr College. Victoria Wesson married
         Lieutenant Demas Thurlow "Nick" Craw (1900-1942) of the Army
         Air Corps on October 31, 1931. The two shared an interest in
         aviation and horses. The Craws were stationed at Schofield
         Barracks and Wheeler Field, Hawaii for three years, followed
         by Mitchel Field, Long Island, Montgomery, Alabama, and
         Langley Field, Virginia. During World War II, Major Craw was
         sent as an observer to the Royal Air Force in the desert
         stations of Egypt. His overseas assignment extended to duties
         in Greece and Turkey. Colonel Craw returned home for a few
         weeks prior to the North African invasion. Craw was killed
         while trying to reach the French commander in Port Lyautey,
         French Morocco on November 8, 1942. He was awarded the
         Congressional Medal of Honor posthumously.</p>
      <p>"Nick" and Victoria Craw had become acquainted with
         Charlottesville by a renewed acquaintance with Craw's West
         Point classmate Hardy Cross Dillard (1902-1982). He had
         introduced them to the University of Virginia's Institute of
         Public Affairs at which Major Craw gave the military point of
         view during the week that France fell. Following the death of
         Colonel Craw, Victoria felt so at home in Charlottesville that
         she decided to make her home there permanently. She went to
         work at the School of Military Government, housing the
         officers and making sure their medical needs were met. This
         was followed by a position as executive secretary for the
         McIntire Tumor Clinic. In the mid 1940s, Victoria and her son,
         Nicholas Wesson Craw, lived in Geneva, Switzerland, where he
         was exposed to and excellent education and foreign languages.
         She worked at the World's Alliance of the Y. M. C. A. doing
         odd jobs including the writing and recording of short wave
         broadcasts to English-speaking countries. Upon her return to
         Charlottesville, Victoria Craw became involved in civic
         affairs. She worked with the League of Women Voters, the first
         Blood Recruitment Program for the Red Cross, Planned
         Parenthood of Central Virginia, the Civic League of
         Charlottesville and Albemarle, the Board of Martha Jefferson
         Hospital, the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center,
         and others.</p>
