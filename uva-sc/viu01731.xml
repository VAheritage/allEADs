      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Charles Turner Williams was born at Warrenton, North
         Carolina, on October 17, 1874, the son of Thomas Clay and
         Georgianna (Turner) Williams. He married Willie Herbert
         Ashton, of Portsmouth, Virginia, on July 17, 1903, and had two
         children, Charles Turner Williams, Jr. and Ann Elizabeth
         Williams.</p>
      <p>Williams was entirely self-taught and began his career as a
         stenographer and newspaper reporter. He then began working in
         the accounting and operating departments of a railway
         business, advancing to Division Superintendent. He entered the
         private banking business with John L. Williams &amp; Sons,
         Richmond, Virginia, in 1904, as the private secretary of John
         Skelton Williams. He served as secretary to the receivers of
         the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, 1908-1910. In 1910, he became
         associated with Middendorf, Williams, &amp; Company, bankers
         in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
      <p>From 1912-1919, Williams was the investment manager of
         Fidelity Trust Company in Baltimore, becoming Vice-President
         of Fidelity Securities Corporation of Maryland in 1920. He was
         one of the organizers of the Investment Bankers Association of
         America and served two terms as Treasurer, 1912-1914.</p>
      <p>When the United States entered the war in 1917, Williams
         applied for a commission in the Army but was turned down for
         health reasons. Because of his association with Henry P.
         Davidson, who was the head of the American Red Cross, Williams
         was commissioned a captain in the ARC and assigned to the
         mission to establish a hospital in Jassy, Romania, the capital
         of Romania at that time. To avoid the German lines, the
         Mission had to travel the Trans-Siberian Railroad from
         Vladivostock to Moscow. At Moscow, Williams was detached from
         the Mission and sent to Archangel, North Russia, to meet the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Portonia,</title>the ship carrying the
         hospital supplies for Romania, and to escort the train load of
         supplies to Jassy, Romania. Upon the completion of this
         mission Williams returned home to Baltimore.</p>
      <p>In 1918 the American Expeditionary Forces placed a Detroit
         regiment (the 339th Infantry) in the port of Archangel, North
         Russia, on August third, ostensibly with the objective of
         guarding military stores and assisting the White Russian army
         in repelling Bolshevik attacks. The American Red Cross wanted
         to send a mission to help American soldiers on duty in this
         inhospitable region, to establish an ARC hospital, and render
         civilian relief. Because of Williams' previous experience in
         Archangel, he was promoted to Major and put in charge of the
         ARC Mission to Russia. The Mission sailed from New York on the
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Ascutney</title>on August 25, 1918.
         Williams returned to his banking career in the United States
         on March 6, 1919, after he had met with considerable success
         in meeting the needs of the American and other Allied
         soldiers, establishing the ARC hospital, and making several
         trips into the Russian interior to supply the Russian peasants
         with food and medicines.</p>

         27); and Admiral Newton A. McCully concerning North Russian
         affairs (1919 Aug 16).</p>
      <p>This series also contains a small notebook about the ARC
         work in Romania, [1917], and begins with notes on "Bessarabia"
         and the crossing of the Romanian border, discusses the state
         of the country, especially shortages of food and supplies,
         describes Roman and Jassy, and includes stories of the
         hospital and individual patient cases in Jassy, Romania.</p>
      <p>Another small notebook contains material about the trip to
         Russia with a detailed chronological account of the ARC
         Mission's movements, notes on North Russian currency, a
         typescript of reporter Frazier Hunt's story of the sled trips
         to the front in North Russia, samples of Bolshevist
         propaganda, a description of Brest, France (1919 Feb 28), and
         a copy of Williams' letter to his daughter while on the North
         Sea (1919 Feb 16).</p>
      <p>Other papers in this series include an organizational
         summary of the ARC Mission to Romania, reports on work in the
         ARC hospital in Romania, and a summary of the activities of
         the ARC expedition to Northern Russia, 1918-1919.</p>
      <p>The next series consists of topical and miscellaneous
         files. For a complete list of these files consult the folder
         listing at the end of the guide. Most of this material is
         duplicated in the notebook of copies kept by Williams
         concerning the ARC Mission to Russia. The financial papers
         comprise both the Romanian and Russian expeditions and contain
         records not found elsewhere in the collection. The personnel
         file includes staff from both expeditions and a list of the
         officers of the North Russian Expeditionary Force (n.d.).</p>
      <p>The photograph series contains postcards of Romania, the
         Japanese Red Cross Hospital, and Russia, Russian paper
         currency and stamps, Norwegian stamps, as well as photographs
         of the American Red Cross work in North Russia.</p>
      <p>The photographs chiefly concern the American Red Cross work
         in North Russia, Major C.T. Williams, and Russian scenes. Most
         of these photographs were taken by Harold MacKenzie Wyckoff,
         the American Red Cross photographer. A folder of miscellaneous
         photographs includes: the Y.M.C.A. in Archangel, Russian,
         British, and French leaders, American Red Cross officers, and
         military scenes from the Archangel front and France.</p>
      <p>Also present in this series is a photograph album of the
         American Red Cross Mission to Russia, copyrighted by Major
         Orrin S. Wightman, 1917, with a printed index.</p>
      <p>The printed series includes: the American Expeditionary
         Forces G.H.Q. Bulletins; the book
