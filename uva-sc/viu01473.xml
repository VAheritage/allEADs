      <p>This collection consists of letters and photographs, ca.
         1942-1946, of Dowell Jennings Howard, Jr., son of Dr. D.J.
         Howard, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and
         great-grandson of Dr. Henry Howard, Professor of Medicine at
         the University of Virginia, written while serving in the armed
         forces during World War II. These letters were written to his
         grandparents, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Henry Howard, Brookville,
         Maryland, and parallel the letters in 11084-a written to his
         sister, Marianna Howard Parrish. Howard had been attending
         V.P.I. and had to leave for Company E, Camp Lee, Virginia, and
         basic training in the middle of the academic year [1943 Mar
         16].</p>
      <p>Howard stayed at Camp Lee for eleven days and then
         entrained at night on March 15 for basic training at Miami,
         Florida, which had a permanent dim out because of submarines
         (1943 Mar 18). While in Miami, Howard worked at the Basic
         Training Center No. 4 Butcher Shop one day and saw a large
         turtle which supplied 1300 pounds of meat for the camp (1943
         Apr 20). Other topics mentioned in his letters include: his
         move to Flight Q (1943 Apr 28); learning to repair weapons at
         the Ordnance School Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland (1943
         May 24); his move to the 53rd Bomb Squadron, 46th Bomb Group,
         Will Rogers Field, Oklahoma City where he filled practice
         bombs with sand for the bombers (1943 Jul 6); and learning how
         to camouflage equipment, drive army vehicles from the size of
         jeeps up to one and a half ton trucks, and bomb reconnaisance
         (1943 Aug 8).</p>
      <p>Other subjects include: his acceptance for special training
         in mechanical engineering at Oklahoma A &amp; M College,
         Stillwater, Oklahoma (1943 Aug 27, Sep 13, Oct 10, Nov 13);
         his move to Company "A," 395th Infantry Regiment, Camp Maxey,
         Texas (1944 Apr 10); reference to the Normandy Invasion (1944
         June 11); teaching swimming classes and working at the 799th
         Ordnance Company blueing plant (1944 Jul 7); his grandfather's
         death (1944 Sep 3); and at sea on a troop ship (1944 Oct
         9).</p>
      <p>Also present are fifty black &amp; white photographs, ca.
         1944-1946, pertaining to the military service of Dowell J.
         Howard, Jr.. These include: Howard and his dog "Blackie" taken
         before he left for Europe; his trip from Le Harve to his home
         in the United States via New York harbour; the North Atlantic;
         Wurtzburg, Germany; Belgium following the Battle of the Bulge;
         Prien Airfield, Bavaria; Sarrebourg, France; the 783rd
