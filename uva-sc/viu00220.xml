          JOHN HENRY INGRAM : EDITOR, BIOGRAPHER,
         AND COLLECTOR OF POE MATERIALS</p>
      <p>by 
          John Carl Miller </p>
      <p>When 
          John Ingram died in 
          Brighton, England, on February l2, l9l6,
         he had, as he expressed it, "a room-full of Poe." At that time
         scholars on both sides of the Atlantic were well aware of
         Ingram's collection of Poe materials. Both its size and value
         had been suggested by Ingram's four-volume edition of Poe's
         works, prefaced by an original and controversial Memoir, and
         its worth had further been proved by the two-volume biography
         of Poe in which Ingram had published a great deal of new and
         important information. So impressed was the 
          New England editor and critic 
          Thomas Wentworth Higginson that he
         addressed an anxious communication to Ingram on February l,
         l880, about his collection: "I hope that if you should ever
         have occasion to sell it or should bequeath it (absit omen! in
         either case) it may come to some Public Library in this
         country."</p>
      <p>Ingram's Poe collection was to grow enormously through many
         more years, and in the end Higginson's wish was to be
         fulfilled: it was sold and it did come to 
          America, to the 
          Alderman Library at the University of
         Virginia.</p>
      <p>This is the curious story of how it happened.</p>
      <p>Interest in the life and work of 
          Edgar Poe was part of Ingram's childhood;
         in his adulthood it became his obsession. By his statement, he
         spent sixty-two years writing about Poe and collecting Poe
         materials. We can be sure he spent as many as fifty-three, for
         he published a poem called "Hope: An Allegory," written in
         imitation of Poe's "Ulalume," in 1863, and in the month before
         he died he published a tart note, setting the record straight
         about Dr. Bransby's school at 
          Stoke Newington. He filled the
         intervening years with almost ceaseless attention to Poe: he
         wrote two biographies, several Memoirs, more than fifty
         magazine articles, as well as Prefaces and Introductions to
         writings on Poe by others, and he published and republished
         Poe's tales, poems, and essays in eight separate editions.
         During these years he carried on bitter warfare in print with
         almost every person who wrote about Poe anywhere, especially
         if the writer was an American, for 
          John Ingram secretly regarded himself as
         the sole redeemer of Poe's besmirched personal reputation and
         as the person most responsible for Poe's renewed, world-wide
         literary reputation.</p>
      <p>II</p>
      <p>
          John Henry Ingram was born on November 16,
         1842, at 29 City Road, 
          Finnsbury, Middlesex, and spent his
         childhood in 
          Stoke Newington, the 
          London suburb where young Poe had himself
         lived. The 
          Stoke Newington Manor House School, which
         Poe describes in "William Wilson," was standing in Ingram's
         youth, and he was quite conscious of it as a tangible link
         between his own life and Poe's. On March 6, l874, Ingram wrote
         an autobiographical account to 
          Sarah Helen Whitman, clearly
         acknowledging Poe's influence on his early life:</p>
      <p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"As a child, before I could read, I determined as I
               looked at my father's great books and saw how they
               interested him, to become an author and by the time I
               could spell words of one syllable I began to write, but
               in prose. One night when I was still a boy I went into
               my own room, and for the five-hundreth time, began to
               read out of Routledge's little volume of 
                Edgar Poe's poems. Suddenly,
               something stirred me till I shuddered with intense
               excitement. "I felt as if a star had burst within my
               brain." I fell on my knees and prayed as I only could
               pray then, and thanked my Creator for having made me a
               poet!"</p>
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>But 
          John Ingram was not destined to become a
         poet, and he soon realized it. After publishing and
         suppressing his first volume of poetry in 1863, he wrote a
         pathetic "Farewell to Poesy" in 1864, bidding adieu to what
         was then the dearest hope of his life.</p>
      <p>Private tutors and private schools furnished 
          John Ingram's formal education during his
         childhood, until he entered 
          Lyonsdown. Later, after he had registered
         at the 
          City of London College, his father died,
         and Ingram was forced to withdraw and take up the job of
         supporting himself, his mother, and his two sisters. On
         January l3, l868, he received a Civil Service Commission, with
         an appointment to the 
          Savings Bank Department of the London General Post
         Office.</p>
      <p>Ingram then molded his life into a pattern which he
         followed doggedly for the rest of his days. He spent his days
         working at his clerkship and he spent his evenings studying,
         writing, and lecturing, complaining irascibly when social
         invitations or professional functions forced him to break this
         routine.</p>
      <p>On Saturday afternoons his friends could always find 
          John Ingram in the 
          Reading Room of the British Museum
         Library. He had learned to speak and write French,
         German, Spanish, and Italian (later in life he added a working
         knowledge of Portuguese and Hungarian). He contributed
         literary articles to leading reviews in 
          England, 
          France, and 
          America, and he lectured frequently, for
         pay, on contemporary literature. He broke his persevering,
         even stubborn, devotion to work and study only occasionally by
         business trips through 
          Ireland and 
          Scotland or to the Continent, or by trips
         to the 
          Isle of Wight and other watering places in
         search of relief from recurring attacks of rheumatic fever,
         which plagued him all of his life. He was determined to be an
         author of important books and in 1868, in spite of his
         difficulties, he made a beginning.</p>
      <p>Ingram called his first book Flora Symbolica; or, the
         Language and Sentiment of Flowers. The book was a history of
         the floriography, with an examination of the meaning and
         symbolism, of more than one hundred different flowers,
         garlands, and bouquets. He wrote long essays on each flower
         and included with each one colored illustrations, legends,
         anecdotes, and poetical allusions. His volume was beautifully
         bound and printed, infinitely detailed, and it revealed
         clearly his method as an author: he had thoroughly sifted,
         condensed, and used, with augmentations, the writings of his
         predecessors (a method of editing and writing he was to use
         always, while condemning it in others) in this science of
         sweet things." In his Preface, he told his readers with
         characteristic bluntness: "Although I dare not boast that I
         have exhausted the subject, I may certainly affirm that
         followers will find little left to glean in the paths I have
         traversed." "It will be found to be the most complete work on
         the subject ever published," he wrote. He was probably right,
         too. The important thing is that here, very early, he had
         epitomized his guiding philosophy as a writer and an editor.
         His job, as he saw it, was to learn all that had been done on
         whatever subject he was engaged and to strive passionately to
         produce a work of his own that would be significant for its
         completeness.</p>
      <p>This book on floriography was the product of a rapidly
         maturing scholar, not that of a youth of nineteen, as his
         later juggling of his birth date would have it appear. He was
         actually twenty-six years old when he first demonstrated his
         abilities as a compiler, editor, and author. Everything about
         this volume shows that Ingram's methods in bookmaking were
         rather firmly decided upon before he commenced his important
         work on Poe, and he altered those methods scarcely at all, no
         matter what his subject, in the next forty-eight years.</p>
      <p>Having served his literary apprenticeship, 
          John Ingram was ready, by 1870, to begin
         writing books that would, he hoped, be financially profitable
         and at the same time bring to him lasting literary fame. He
         had already, for a long while, studied Poe's writings, reading
         and collecting everything he saw about the poet, and he became
         possessed by a deep, almost instinctive belief that Poe had
         been cruelly wronged by the Memoir that 
          Rufus W. Griswold had written and
         published in l850. And so, 
          John Ingram found his work: he determined
         to destroy Griswold's Memoir of Poe by proving its author a
         liar and a forger, and, in time, to write a new biography that
         would present to the world 
          Edgar Poe as he really was. In order to do
         these things it would be necessary, of course, for him to
         examine everything, both favorable and unfavorable, that had
         been written about Poe, to search for new material, and to
         learn so much about Poe that he could reconstruct, as it were,
         the true character of the man and writer, as he felt it to
         be.</p>
      <p>At this point, Ingram's life appeared to have a certain
         stability. He had a respectable and obviously not too
         demanding job that assured financial independence, and he was
         the author of a book popular enough to call for three
         editions, which brought to him a certain amount of literary
         recognition. But there was another side to his nature, a
         darker side that tormented and divided his life. As he began
         assembling materials for a defense of 
          Edgar Poe he worked spasmodically, beset
         by worry, self-doubt, trouble, and fear. His temper was quick
         to explode and his sensitive nature found injury and fault
         where little or none of either was intended or existed. Some
         explanation of this duality in his nature is found in a shamed
         confession he made to Mrs. Whitman about the hereditary curse
         that hung over his household: two aunts, his father, and a
         sister, one after the other, had succumbed to insanity and had
         either died or had to be removed from home. His own mind was
         as clear and acute as possible, he insisted, and the family
         curse appeared unlikely to fall upon him if his worldly
         affairs jogged along composedly, but the knowledge of the
         taint in his blood was a terrible thing to him. Perhaps there
         is enough here to explain why Ingram's disposition early
         became choleric, why he never married, and why he suffered all
         of his life from recurring sicknesses, real or imaginary.</p>
      <p>By 1870 there was a growing international interest in Poe's
         genius. A new generation had grown up to be fascinated by his
         tales and poems, and the older generations had in a measure
         forgotten the unpleasant stories connected with Poe's life. A
         minority group of Poe's friends in 
          America knew that Griswold's Memoir had
         been motivated by jealousy and hatred, but no one of them had
         the information, the literary ability, and the strength
         necessary to publish an effectively documented denial of
         Grisold's Memoir and to replace it with an honest biography.
         These friends of Poe's were widely separated, largely unknown
         to each other; all had been seriously affected by a decade of
         war and its aftermath, and all of them were growing old. If
         Poe's memory was to be vindicated, it was fairly certain that
         it would have to be done by someone younger, someone who would
         not personally have known Poe. Not a single one of Poe's close
         friends who still lived in the l870's had any idea or plan for
         doing the job himself, but a number of them were eager to help
         someone else do it.</p>
      <p>Such, in brief, was the situation when 
          John Henry Ingram of 
          Stoke Newington determined to prove to the
         world his theory that 
          Rufus Griswold had been a liar and that 
          Edgar Poe had been shamefully
         maligned.</p>
      <p>The first articles Ingram published in l873 and early l874
         had little new information in them which would vindicate Poe's
         reputation; Ingram was of necessity feeling his way, and he
         used these magazine publications to announce clearly his
         purpose, before diving into the melee. He intended to refute,
         step by step, the aspersions cast on Poe's character by
         Griswold and to publish an edition of Poe's works which would
         not only be more complete than any hitherto published, but
         which, through a Memoir as its Preface, would clear Poe's name
         and present him to the world as the great artist and fine
         gentleman he really was.</p>
      <p>After his first flight into the thin air of creative and
         imaginative writing, Ingram's muse brought him closer to earth
         and he really found himself at home in the murky atmosphere of
         the 
          British Museum. Ingram was a natural
         researcher. Armed with righteous indignation and the tools of
         scholarship, he became a crusader enlisted in a holy cause;
         the peculiar combination within him of a sensitive, poetic
         soul and a zealot's concentrated energy uniquely fitted him
         for the challenging job of righting the wrongs he believed had
         been done to Poe.</p>
      <p>Having exhausted his resources at hand, Ingram turned to 
          America in the hope of finding there
         friends of Poe who still resented the injustice done to him
         enough to help clear his name. The adroit timing and the
         felicity of this plan quickly became apparent. It was not
         difficult for Ingram to communicate his sincere feeling that
         his work was a crusade against evil, and Poe's friends were
         delighted with the boyish fervor of this young and already
         distinguished English scholar who was so unselfishly
         championing the poet's blighted reputation. Poe had been dead
         for nearly twenty-five years and many of his friends were
         hastening to their own graves, but they responded immediately
         to Ingram's letters and joined in a tireless search for
         recollections of Poe's literary and personal activities,
         sending letters Poe had written to them, manuscripts, books,
         and even personal keepsakes Poe had given to them. 
          Sarah Helen Whitman, excited over the
         prospect of Ingram's writing an authoritative biography of
         Poe, wrote out for him everything she could remember of her
         personal meetings with Poe, sent him manuscripts, hundreds of
         newsclippings, magazine articles, copied letters and excerpts
         from articles, and gave unreservedly from her remarkable store
         of information about what others had written and said about
         Poe. 
          Annie Richmond entrusted to Ingram the
         only copies she had ever made of her precious letters from
         Poe, and sent him copies of Poe's books that had been found in
         Poe's trunk after he died. 
          Marie Louise Shew Houghton sent letters
         and copies of letters from Poe, a miniature of Poe's mother,
         and at least three manuscript poems Poe had given her. 
          Stella Lewis gave him Poe's manuscript of
         "Politian," and willed to him the daguerreotype which Poe had
         given to her in l848. 
          Edward V. Valentine of 
          Richmond, 
          William Hand Browne of 
          Johns Hopkins University, 
          John Neal, Poe's sister Rosalie, the 
          Poe family in 
          Baltimore, including 
          Neilson Poe and his daughter Amelia, and
         many, many others contributed to Ingram's surprisingly large
         store of information about Poe. And when 
          William Fearing Gill and 
          Eugene L. Didier came to many of these
         same persons asking for help on their biographies of Poe,
         these correspondents showed a surprising disposition to
         withhold everything for Ingram and to betray to him the
         activities of his American rivals. Later when violent personal
         and literary quarrels broke out between Ingram and these
         American biographers of Poe, Ingram's epistolary friends
         encouraged him in private correspondence and defended him
         vigorously in the public press. Poe's friends had become
         Ingram's partisans. A steadily rising stream of books,
         letters, manuscripts, pictures, and newsclippings passed from 
          America to 
          England, with a few of them, but very
         few, finding their way back again. The aggregate of Ingram's
         correspondence on Poe matters is staggering when one realizes
         that he carried it on single-handedly, and published during
         these years sixteen books on other subjects while holding an
         everyday job at the General Post Office.</p>
      <p>From the two bound volumes of the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Broadway Journal</title> that
         Mrs. Whitman sent, Ingram was able to make a number of
         important additions to the cannon of Poe's writings when he
         published his edition of Poe's works. Poe had given these
         volumes, covering his editorship of the Journal, to Mrs.
         Whitman in l848, and had gone through them and initialed with
         "P" almost everything he had written. Mrs. Whitman had first
         offered to lend these volumes to Ingram, but then, feeling the
         time of her death drawing near, she decided to give them to
         him. Accordingly, on April 2, 1874, she mailed them with the
         injunction that they be returned to her "at the opening of the
         seventh seal."</p>
      <p>In the Preface of his l880 two-volume biography of Poe, 
          John Ingram bade farewell "to what has
         engrossed so much of my life and labour." He was convinced
         that he had garnered almost all of the genuine Poe documents
         there were and that his accurate and complete biography had
         dealt conclusively with everything of importance concerning
         Poe. His work was finished, he sincerely thought.</p>
      <p>But Ingram was not through with Poe. He should have
         understood himself and the reputation he had acquired as a Poe
         scholar well enough to know that he could not be through. The
         popularity of his edition had created a large market for Poe's
         writings and his biography had stirred up so much controversy,
         particularly in 
          America, that he had rather to increase
         sharply his activities, for he was quickly challenged about
         statements in his published works. Quick to resent
         encroachment on what he considered his private preserves, he
         rapidly found himself at odds with a number of persons who had
         begun writing on Poe, for he could detect in their
         publications borrowings from his own, borrowings made more
         often than not without acknowledgment.</p>
      <p>Ingram could not copyright facts, and he grew steadily more
         embittered as he saw the fruits of his research become public
         property. A new era of investigation into Poe's writings and
         life was beginning in 
          America, an era brought about principally
         by Ingram's controversial personality and by the tone of his
         published writings about Poe. Competent scholars were entering
         the field to contest Ingram's claims of being the leading Poe
         authority, and these new American writers were rapidly making
         the early efforts of W. F. Gill and Eugene Didier appear
         puerile indeed. 
          George W. Woodberry, 
          Edmund C. Stedman, and 
          R. H. Stoddard were formidable new
         biographers and suitors of Poe, and Ingram had not as yet, in
         the 1880's, taken their measure. Far from being finished with
         his work, he was really only beginning. During the next
         thirty-five years he struck back angrily through the columns
         of important newspapers and journals --to which his reputation
         as a Poe scholar gave him easy access --at other writers who,
         as he saw it, had stolen his Poe materials or who had altered
         the Poe image he had tried so hard to create. When reviewing
         new editions and biographies of Poe, Ingram tried to demolish
         them with a wit as rapier-like as was Poe's; unfortunately for
         him, his witty thrusts resembled broad-ax blows. Where Poe had
         been original and cruel, Ingram was simply sarcastic and
         repetitious. But through their reviews Ingram and Poe did
         achieve the same result: they both made enduring, deadly,
         vociferous enemies.</p>
      <p>In 1884 Ingram edited a de luxe four-volume edition of
         Tales and Poems of 
          Edgar Allan Poe for English publication,
         and for the 
          Tauchnitz Press in 
          Leipzig he edited separate volumes of
         Poe's Tales and Poems; in 1885 he published a volume on Poe's
         "The Raven"; in 1886 he prepared a one-volume reprint of the
         two-volume biography of Poe he had issued in 1880; and in 1888
         he brought out the first variorum edition of Poe's poems. With
         these publications Ingram was represented on the literary
         market by one edition or another which covered every phase of
         Poe's activities. Thus, finally, was completed the body of his
         important work on Poe.</p>
      <p>In still another sense 
          John Ingram's work on Poe was finished.
         His whole method of investigation had been based on personal
         correspondence with Poe's friends, and year by year the circle
         had grown smaller until, in 1888, only 
          Annie Richmond was left. His early, happy
         inspiration of searching out Poe's friends had yielded rich
         results. Now those persons were silent, but their memories,
         their letters, and their precious papers had been given into
         Ingram's keeping; and he had used most of these things in
         publishing in every area of Poe scholarship, until, at the
         close of 1888, there was literally nothing left for him to do.
         But his collection remained and was the envy of Poe scholars
         everywhere.</p>
      <p>
          John Ingram was retired with a pension
         from the Civil Service in 1903, after thirty-five years in the
         General Post Office. He continued living in 
          London with his only remaining sister,
         Laura, writing articles, caustically reviewing new books about
         Poe and new editions of Poe's works, and in 1909 Ingram led
         the English celebration of Poe's centenary, bringing out still
         another edition of Poe's poems and furnishing to the London
         Bookman practically all of the materials used in its 
          Edgar Allan Poe Centenary Number. In these
         years of retirement Ingram began putting into final form his
         definitive biography of Poe. He felt he could use everything
         in his files, now that all of the people who had sent
         materials to him were dead, to achieve the distinction he
         wanted more than anything else --to be remembered by the world
         as the one authentic and complete biographer of Edgar Poe. In
         1912 Ingram moved his household from 
          London to 
          Brighton. There for a few years he
         enjoyed the sea-bathing he loved so well, and there he died on
         February 12, 1916. His passing went unnoticed. His last
         sickness had evidently not been considered terminal and his
         death must have come unexpectedly, for he left no clear-cut
         arrangements for disposing of his affairs or for the huge
         collection of Poe materials, the pride of his life. It is
         strange that he had not long before made definite provision
         for his Poe collection, for it constituted his greatest claim
         to personal and literary fame, and 
          John Ingram was a man mindful of history's
         judgment. Through the years, it is true, he had sold almost
         all of his original Poe letters and some of the more important
         items given him by Poe's friends, but he had kept accurate
         copies of everything he had sold. Ingram had justified his
         actions by insisting he had sacrificed his own fortune and
         health in trying to clear Poe's name and if his work was to
         continue the sales were necessary to provide money for it.
         Even though these original letters and manuscripts were no
         longer part of his collection, the things that remained were
         very important, and 
          John Ingram knew it. Nothing else he had
         published had brought his name before the world as had his
         publications on Poe and the reputation he had gained as a
         collector of Poe materials.</p>
      <p>III</p>
      <p>Shortly after John Ingram's death, Miss 
          Laura Ingram caused something of a stir in
         the scholarly worlds of 
          England and 
          America by advertising for sale her
         brother's entire library. Although 
          John Ingram had become an anachronism, his
         out-dated biographical methods having long been superseded by
         the careful, painstaking, scholarly practices of Professors 
          James A. Harrison and 
          Killis Campbell, the number of important
         "first" Poe publications Ingram had scored was still green in
         the memories of all concerned. Poe scholars knew that in his
         declining years Ingram had lost his knack of ferreting out new
         and important facts about Poe, but they also knew that shortly
         before his death Ingram had completed a new biography of Poe.
         While they did not expect that manuscript to be among the
         papers offered for sale, there was every reason to believe the
         materials from which he had written it would be. More
         important than this, scholars everywhere wanted to see those
         original manuscripts and letters by means of which Ingram had
         forty years before made so many important contributions to Poe
         biography.</p>
      <p>Word of the proposed sale reached the 
          University of Virginia early in the summer
         of 1916. Librarian 
          John S. Patton promptly sent an inquiry to
         Ingram's heirs, through the American Consul in 
          London, asking what books and papers
         about Poe were to be sold. Miss 
          Laura Ingram as promptly answered his
         inquiry and enclosed a partial list of the Poe books, letters,
         and papers she wished to sell, asking l50 pounds sterling for
         the lot. Patton felt this too inclusive a basis on which to
         buy, so he countered with a proposition that Miss Ingram send
         the entire collection to 
          Virginia for examination and evaluation;
         for an option to buy any or all of the collection the
         University would pay shipping expenses and insurance from 
          England to 
          America, and back again, if need be.
         Patton's interest was principally in the letters and portraits
         in the collection; the University, he wrote, not altogether
         accurately, already had most of the books on Poe that Miss
         Ingram had listed.</p>
      <p>Miss Ingram agreed to Patton's proposal but delayed the
         shipment because there was a great risk of losing the
         collection. 
          England was at war with 
          Germany and enemy submarines had begun
         taking a heavy toll of English merchant shipping. After a few
         months, when the immediacies of war occupied both Miss Ingram
         and the University officials, correspondence about the Poe
         papers was dropped.</p>
      <p>In 1919, 
          James Southall Wilson, a young Professor
         of English from 
          William and Mary came to join the 
          University of Virginia faculty. A seminar
         course on Poe's works was being organized for the first time
         at the University and Dr. Wilson was scheduled to teach it.
         Although he was not at the time either a Poe specialist or a
         specialist in American literature Dr. Wilson had, however,
         long been keenly interested in Poe's writings. Shortly after
         his arrival, 
          John Patton mentioned to him in casual
         conversation that he had a partial list of 
          John Ingram's Poe Collection which had
         been for sale some years before. When Dr. Wilson saw the list
         his imagination quickly became fired with the possibilities of
         what the whole collection might be; so he maneuvered hastily,
         to enlist President 
          Edwin A. Alderman's support, gathered
         accumulated Library funds, and reopened the correspondence
         with Miss Ingram about her brother's papers.</p>
      <p>Miss Ingram's health had been seriously affected by her
         brother's death and by the privations of the war; once the
         fighting was over she had begun making hurried efforts to
         dispose of the Poe papers to any acceptable university or
         library authorities. She had wanted them to go to the 
          University of Virginia for safekeeping,
         since her brother had paid marked attention to Poe's alma
         mater, but a number of years had passed without further word
         from 
          Charlottesville. Fearfully believing her
         own death to be at hand, she had seized an opportunity to sell
         the papers to the 
          University of Texas.</p>
      <p>Professor 
          Killis Campbell, an editor of Poe's poems
         and himself a Virginian, wrote Miss Ingram, as Chairman of the
          Department of English at the University of
         Texas, that he would consider buying her Poe papers
         only after the 
          University of Virginia had definitely
         refused their purchase.</p>
      <p>Still another possible solution to Miss Ingram's problem
         then presented itself: a Harvard Professor, vacationing in
         England, came to 
          Brighton to examine the Poe collection,
         with the idea of buying it for his university.</p>
      <p>At this point Miss Ingram received Dr. Wilson's renewed
         request to ship the papers on approval to 
          Virginia. She did not want this
         indefiniteness. Getting the papers packed and shipped,
         furthermore, would be a difficult and confusing job, for the
         Poe collection had somehow become mixed with the remnants of 
          John Ingram's once enviable collections
         of materials about 
          Christopher Marlowe, Chatterton, 
          Oliver Madox-Brown, and 
          Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Sudden
         interest in the Poe papers on the part of an English purchaser
         offered her a way out. She stopped short and awaited an offer
         from any one of the prospective buyers who would relieve her
         of the trouble of packing and shipping the papers. A quick
         acceptance of her terms by the English agent, the Harvard
         professor, or by the 
          University of Texas would have changed the
         fate of the Poe papers.</p>
      <p>The 
          University of Virginia's correspondence
         about the papers had not involved an agent, since it was begun
         and ended by personal letters between 
          John Patton, Dr. Wilson, and Miss Ingram.
         Yet, some knowledge of the prospective return of 
          John Ingram's Poe papers to 
          America reached numerous scholars,
         authors, teachers, and booksellers, for they began sending
         requests to the 
          University of Virginia for permission to
         examine and use or to purchase portions of the collection. The
         first word the University itself had that they were to receive
         the Poe Collection came from 
          J. H. Whitty, 
          Richmond book collector and editor of
         Poe's poems, who wrote 
          John Patton on September 23, 1921, saying
         the papers were even then enroute from 
          England to the University. This
         information, Whitty wrote in sly confidence, he had picked up
         through the bookseller's "grapevine."</p>
      <p>In mid-October, 192l, the collection arrived in the 
          United States aboard the SS Northwestern
         Miller, which docked at 
          Philadelphia. The shipment, consigned by 
          John Patton as "settler's effects," was
         passed through Customs free of duty. But Patton, who had not
         been in 
          England for a decade, resolutely refused
         to sign an affidavit declaring the boxes contained his
         household goods; consequently, two weeks passed before
         official confusion was cleared up and the shipment
         released.</p>
      <p>The two great packing cases actually reached the University
         in the first week of November and were isolated in a small
         room in the basement of the Rotunda to await examination by
         Dr. Wilson in whatever time he could spare from his teaching
         duties.</p>
      <p>Dr. Wilson found his job long and tiring, but always
         interesting, and at times very exciting. 
          John Ingram's Poe collection was bulky,
         varied and rich.</p>
      <p>IV</p>
      <p>Perhaps the prize single article in the Poe Collection was
         the original "Stella" daguerreotype of Poe --the one Poe had
         given to Mrs. Lewis in l848, which she in turn willed to 
          John Ingram in l880. And among the
         hundreds of letters from Ingram's correspondents, perhaps none
         were more interesting to Dr. Wilson, nor to Poe students
         later, than those from 
          Sarah Helen Whitman. This strange and
         charming woman had cherished for twenty-five years the image
         of herself as his one great love, after her brief engagement
         of three months to Poe in l848, and she had written to 
          John Ingram the fullest account there is
         of their personal relationships. Her ninety-eight letters to
         Ingram narrowly escaped being destroyed by 
          Laura Ingram, who felt, for reasons best
         known to herself, Mrs. Whitman's letters were unfit to be in
         her brother's collection. Fortunately, Miss Ingram decided to
         include the letters in the shipment and let the Virginia
         authorities decide whether or not they should be
         destroyed.</p>
      <p>Ingram's letters to 
          Annie Richmond had also evoked full and
         generous replies. She placed her whole trust in Ingram and
         wanted him to understand, as she felt sure no mortal except
         herself had understood, the purity and nobility of Poe's mind
         and spirit. The copies she made of Poe's letters to herself
         for 
          John Ingram, found in this collection,
         are the only ones in existence; the originals have
         disappeared.</p>
      <p>Dr. Wilson also found in this collection many letters from 
          Marie Louise Shew Houghton, who had
         nursed 
          Virginia Poe during her last sickness at 
          Fordham and had watched over Poe as he
         suffered a long and violent attack after Virginia's death.
         Mrs. Houghton had sent to Ingram either the originals or
         copies of all the manuscripts and letters she had received
         from Poe, in addition to a sometimes confusing but invaluable
         account of Poe's family life.</p>
      <p>Letters from these three ladies made up the largest group
         that Ingram had received, but Dr. Wilson found many additional
         letters and items of importance. There was the original
         drawing of Poe that 
          Edouard Manet had made and presented to 
          Stephane Mallarme, who had in turn given
         it to 
          John Ingram ; a pen drawing of 
          Marie Louise Shew, made by an unknown
         hand; letters from 
          Rosalie Poe, begging, shortly before she
         died, for Ingram's financial help; a penciled letter from Poe
         himself to 
          Stella Lewis written on the back of her
         manuscript poem "The Prisoner of Perote"; letters and
         documents from 
          Edward V. Valentine, the Richmond
         sculptor who first persuaded 
          Elmira Royster Shelton to relate for
         Ingram her early and late memories of Poe; letters from Sir 
          Arthur Conan Doyle, 
          John Neal, 
          Elizabeth Oakes Smith, and many other
         letters Dr. Wilson knew to be without parallel in any
         collection of Poe papers.</p>
      <p>Miss Ingram had not included in the shipment "a good many"
         letters from Miss 
          Amelia FitzGerald Poe, since they "threw
         too little fresh light on her nephew's life to be of an
         interest," nor had she included old copies of the Southern
         Literary Messenger and Burton's Gentleman's Magazine, feeling
         certain the University would already have them. 
          Amelia Poe was the daughter of 
          Neilson Poe, who had buried Edgar in 
          Baltimore in l849, and the custodian of
         many letters from Poe, Mrs. Clemm, Mrs. Whitman, and 
          Annie Richmond ; she had corresponded with
         Ingram over a period of twenty years and was important enough
         to him to receive the dedication of his last biography of Poe.
         These letters and magazines were requested from Miss Ingram
         and in time they were received and restored to the
         collection.</p>
      <p>After a thorough examination of the collection, Dr. Wilson
         decided it was worth the price asked. In l916 the price had
         been 150 pounds; in 1922 it was 200 pounds. For the entire
         collection, 
          John Patton offered 181 pounds, 14
         shillings ($800), on March 24, 1922.</p>
      <p>Miss Ingram gladly accepted the money and she wrote to the
         officials of the University how pleased she was that what she
         believed to be her dead brother's wish had been carried out:
         his Poe collection was at home in 
          America, and in 
          Virginia, where she was sure he would
         have wanted it to be. And she continued her interest in the
         University, quite often sending cordial letters accompanied by
         packages of books, pictures, and letters which she had come
         across and thought belonged with her brother's Poe collection.
         In 1933, when once again Miss Ingram thought her death was
         near, she sent to the University, as a gift, John Ingram's
         manuscript, "The True Story of 
          Edgar Allan Poe. " This manuscript had
         been in a publisher's hands when Ingram died, but printing was
         delayed until the war should be over. Before that time came,
         however, the publisher had himself died, and 
          Laura Ingram had tried without success to
         place it with other publishers. Its presence in the house made
         her uncomfortable. Would the University accept it and deal
         with it as they saw fit?</p>
      <p>The whole tone of this manuscript convinces the reader that
          John Ingram considered this last
         biography, his farewell to Poe scholarship, to be a volume
         that would triumphantly answer his critics, and would be the
         foundation-stone upon which he would be able to stand forever
         as the uncontestable arbiter of all things concerning Poe. In
         this work he resurveyed his whole knowledge and experience and
         fearlessly handed down his dicta on all controversial Poe
         questions. But unfortunately his spleen overrode his scholarly
         judgment. His virulence against other Poe biographers,
         especially the Americans whom he accused of fraudulently using
         his materials, succeeded in clouding Ingram's own vision and
         writing, and succeeds in destroying for his present day reader
         the confidence necessary in an author's balanced judgment, if
         he is to accept, even partially, the arbitrary rulings. This
         manuscript is not, as Ingram thought it would be, the last
         word on Poe. It is unrelentingly bitter against Poe's
         detractors and Ingram's personal rivals, and it seeks, even
         more than did Ingram's other writings on Poe, to whitewash its
         subject completely. Ingram's perspective seems to have
         deserted him as he wrote this manuscript, and he had little
         left except futile anger.</p>
      <p>V</p>
      <p>The addition of the manuscript life of Poe rounded out the
         collection of Poe papers that once had belonged to 
          John Ingram, now in the possession of the
          University of Virginia.</p>
      <p>One can safely say that had it not been for 
          John Ingram's skill and energy, together
         with the peculiarities of his temperament, we should not now
         have many of these unusual and dependable accounts of Poe's
         activities and personality. By studying Ingram's papers it is
         possible to trace him through a maze of editing and publishing
         and to watch him, step by step, slowly amass his great fund of
         information about Poe. One can see him make mistakes and
         achieve triumphs as he accepts, rejects, and fuses information
         to be included in his numerous publications on Poe. Then, too,
         it is still possible to catch fresh glimpses of Poe himself in
         this collection, for Ingram did not publish all of the
         memories of Poe set down in the letters he received. Some of
         these recollections Ingram deliberately shielded from public
         view, but they are no more apocryphal than many of the
         recollections he chose to believe and to publish; some of the
         records Ingram received he suppressed from delicacy alone.</p>
      <p>A number of scholarly papers, theses, and doctoral
         dissertations have been based on this collection of Poe
         papers, making almost all the more important items and
         clusters of items more readily available to other scholars.
         The complete collection has made possible another kind of
         study, by an examination of Ingram's biographies and editions
         of Poe, in conjunction with the rough materials from which he
         shaped them, it has been possible to make a just evaluation of
         Ingram's place among Poe biographers and editors and to
         demonstrate exactly what and how many important contributions
         he made to the peculiarly difficult field of Poe scholarship.
         Finally, and by no means least important, is the fact that,
         since Ingram's work on Poe covered nearly his whole life span,
         it has been possible for the first time to trace in the great
         mass of his papers a thread of the biography of this
         nineteenth-century professional editor and biographer to whom
         the writer of every signifcant work about Poe since 1874 has
         been directly and heavily indebted.</p>

      <p>A calendar and index of letters and other manuscripts,
         photographs, printed matter, and biographical source materials
         concerning 
          Edgar Allan Poe assembled by 
          John Henry Ingram, with prefatory essay
         by 
          John Carl Miller on Ingram as a Poe editor
         and biographer and as a collector of Poe materials.</p>
      <p>Second Edition by John E. Reilly</p>
      <p>To the Memory of John Carl Miller</p>
      <p>Introduction:</p>
      <p>In 1922 the 
          University of Virginia paid the heirs of 
          John Henry Ingram the munificent sum of
         $800 for the materials Ingram had assembled for his work as
         biographer, editor, and stalwart (i.e., feisty) champion of 
          Edgar Allan Poe. What the University
         acquired is an unparalleled collection of letters and other
         manuscripts, of photographs and daguerreotypes, and of
         newspaper clippings and various other printed materials
         totaling altogether more than a thousand items. Although the
         University made the Collection available to serious students
         of Poe, the contents remained uncatalogued at the 
          Alderman Library until, in the late
         1940's, 
          John Carl Miller, then a graduate
         student, undertook the chore of sorting and classifying the
         mass of material. As it happened, the chore proved to be even
         more than a labor of love: it marked for Miller the beginning
         of a life-long interest both in Ingram and in the materials
         Ingram had compiled. The first fruit of Miller's interest was
         his 1954 doctoral dissertation, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Poe's English Biographer,
          John Henry Ingram : A Biographical Account
         and a Study of His Contributions to Poe Scholarship.</title> Six
         years later the University published the first edition of
         Professor Miller's <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">John Henry Ingram's Poe Collection at the University
            of Virginia.</title> This little book was a "calendar" or chronological
         checklist of the Collection providing a brief description of
         the content of each item. Professor Miller prefaced the
         calendar with his essay on Ingram as "Editor, Biographer, and
         Collector of Poe Materials" and furnished access to the
         calendar through an index. In the mid-1960's Professor Miller
         served as an advisor to the University's project of making the
         entire Collection available on nine reels of microfilm. At the
         same time, however, Professor Miller was laying his own plans
         to make "the more important primary source materials" used by
         Ingram even more available in a multi-volume annotated
         edition. The first of these volumes, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Building Poe Biography,</title> was published by Louisiana State University Press
         in 1977, and the second volume, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Poe's Helen Remembers,</title> appeared two years later from the 
          University Press of Virginia. In
         declining health for a number of years, Professor Miller died
         in October 1979, before any other volumes could be
         prepared.</p>
      <p>At the time of his death, Professor Miller was at work not
         only on his annotated edition of materials in the Collection
         but also on the second edition of the calendar published by
         the 
          University of Virginia almost two decades
         earlier. It is his work on the second edition of the calendar
         that the present volume carries to its conclusion.</p>
      <p>The format of the entries in the calendar is similarly
         unchanged: two paragraphs are devoted to each item, the first
         a bibliographical (if that word can be extended to included
         manuscripts) description of the item and the second paragraph
         a brief account of its content.</p>

                  sometime later she gave it to 
                   Thomas C. Latto who lent it back
                  to her for Ingram's use in 1874. Ingram had this
                  facsimile made and reproduced it in his "Memoir" in
                  his edition of Poe's works, Vol. 1, between pp. lxxvi
                  and lxxvii.</p>

                  glad that Eveleth will try to sell some sets of Poe's

                  he had a host of noble souls ready to refute the base
                  exaggerations and vile misrepresentations 
                   Rufus Griswold has made against

                  only because his handwriting writing was legible.
                  Describes the difficulty the Committee had in
                  choosing a winning story from the rich contents of
                  the "Tales of the Folio Club." When he met Poe after
                  the prize was awarded, Latrobe was impressed by his
                  eloquence and accuracy of minute detail in describing
                  an imaginary voyage to the moon.</p>

            <p>Enclosed in Item 340. Mrs. Lewis says Mrs. Clemm
                  has been a member of her household for several
                  months, that she knew much of Poe and that in her
                  presence he was always the refined gentleman,
                  scholar, and poet. Knows Griswold, too, and does not
                  think he has consumption. Asks about 
                   John Neal's proposed critical
                  survey of American literature. Denies that her name
                  is Sarah Anna,although it was mistakenly printed so;
                  it is Stella Anna, or Estelle Anna. Intends to place

                   Virginia Poe in Greenwood
                  Cemetery; this much done, their literary friends will
                  probably erect a monument over their remains.</p>

                  vulgar man, under any circumstances, but does not
                  doubt that despair did sometimes drag him to the very
                  verge of insanity. Poe dined with her at 3 p.m. and
                  left at 5 p.m. for 
                   Richmond on 29 June 1849. She

                  of him was printed in Russell's Magazine (November
                  1857). Comments on 
                   John R. Thompson's conversation
                  about Poe with 
                   Robert Browning and 
                   Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
                  Offers a critical estimate of the truth in 
                   Harriet Beecher Stowe's book.
                  Mrs. Whitman has written at the top of the letter a
                  brief account of her own relationship to Davidson and
                  of Davidson's relationship to Poe.</p>

                   Greece and

                  literary ladies. Fearing poverty might induce her to

                  for the letters of a certain literary lady, she
                  burned them, too. Other letters she gave to Griswold
                  and now is unable to recover them from Griswold's

            <p>Enclosed in Item 340. Mrs. Whitman has proof that 
                   Rufus Griswold purposely
                  falsified Poe's MSS. and notes about him. Has seen a
                  note Griswold wrote to a New York friend in 1850: "I
                  am getting on rapidly with my Life of Poe and am
                  trying hard to do him justice, for Fanny's spirit
                  looks down on me while I write." Griswold could not
                  forgive Poe the interest he had inspired in Mrs. 
                   Frances Sargent Osgood. Mrs.
                  Whitman has proof, too, from the 
                   University of Virginia that Poe
                  was not expelled. He did not graduate simply because
                  at that time the University conferred no degree. Poe
                  had told her of his intention to write a pendant to
                  his "Domain of Arnheim," and after his death, when
                  she first saw "Landor's Cottage," she realized that
                  he had introduced into it the delicate tints of the
                  wallpaper he had noticed and praised in the room in
                  which they had been sitting as they talked.</p>

                  hand a statement about one of

                   Sallie E. Robins. Had she not
                  wished her book about Poe to be entirely impersonal,
                  she could long ago have refuted Griswold's story of
                  Poe's riotous conduct at the house of a New England
                  lady having made necessary the summoning of police.
                  She writes a summary of Poe's visit to 
                   Providence during which he had to
                  be cared for by a doctor at the home of

                  just seen a copy of the Round Table containing
                  Eveleth's paragraph about Poe's "Marie Roget." Poe
                  told her the fact Eveleth states [i.e., that the

            <p>In reply to his first letter, dated 20 December
                  1873, Mrs. Whitman expresses her gratification at his
                  efforts to write a truthful Memoir of Poe, offers her
                  assistance, but fears he will find the facts of Poe's
                  life so elusive, the dates so contradictory, the
                  details so perverted by relentless enemies and
                  injudicious friends that his task will be very
                  difficult. Has given to 
                   Richard Henry Stoddard letters
                  and documents which prove that Poe was not expelled
                  from the 
                   University of Virginia and that
                  he wrote his first "To Helen" in memory of the
                  beloved mother of one of his schoolmates. In his
                  article on Poe in Harper's Monthly for September
                  1872, Stoddard discredits both, quotes from her 
                   Edgar Poe and His Critics without
                  acknowledgement, and now evades direct replies to her
                  questions. Mrs. Whitman agrees with Ingram that "The
                  Fire Fiend" is a forgery. Mentions:

                  committed outrages in the house of a New England lady
                  on the eve of his marriage to her, and the coolness
                  or estrangement which Poe said existed between
                  himself and his sister Rosalie.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Whitman believes that Mrs. Clemm, not Poe,
                  might have borrowed money from "a distinguished lady
                  of South Carolina." Quotes from Poe's letter to her,
                  24 November 1848, explaining his conduct when 
                   Sarah Margaret Fuller and 
                   Anne C. Lynch (Botta) called on
                  him to retrieve 
                   Frances S. Osgood's letters.
                  Relates a visit she had from Professor 
                   Thomas Wyatt and all she knows of
                  The Conchologist's First Book and Poe's part in it.
                  Does not think Poe wrote "To Isadore," since he did
                  not mark it in the two volumes of the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Broadway Journal</title> which he gave to her. Tells of 
                   James W. Davidson's attempts to
                  clear Poe's name. 
                   George Eveleth is a loyal
                  supporter of Poe and thinks 
                   Rufus Griswold fabricated the
                  letter in which Poe is quoted as calling Eveleth "a
                  Yankee impertinent," for Poe knew Eveleth was a
                  Marylander and Griswold did not. Will try to recover
                  from 
                   William F. Gill the printed
                  account of 
                   William Gowans' recollections of
                  Poe. Both 
                   John P. Kennedy and 
                   J. H. B.Latrobe have assured
                  Eveleth that they and the Committee did not award the
                  Baltimore Saturday Visiter prize to Poe for his tale
                  under "anything like the circumstances" given by
                  Griswold.</p>

                  Whitman early in the summer of 1848, he appeared to

                  say gratifying things about Mrs. Whitman. When Poe
                  sent her the anonymous poem beginning "I saw thee
                  once --once only," she replied, also anonymously,
                  with six lines from her poem "A Night in August."</p>

            <p>Mrs. Whitman thinks Ingram's article on Poe in the
                  London Mirror for February is admirable, but she
                  offers a few a corrections. Mrs. Botta (Anne C. Lynch ) is very much
                  afraid of being socially compromised and likes to
                  keep the peace with everyone. Mrs. 
                   Elizabeth F. Ellet still lives
                  and would be implacable toward anyone who told the
                  true story of her part in Poe's affairs. Poe's
                  article on 
                   William Ellery Channing is not
                  less amusing than true. Poe erred in calling him the
                  son of the distinguished clergyman of the same name.
                  He was his nephew.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Whitman trusts Ingram's heart and intellect
                  but fears his impetuosity in his work on Poe. Mrs. 
                   Maria Clemm had written that Poe
                  was in 
                   Richmond only once after Virginia
                  died. Tells the story of Poe's leaving out the last
                  stanza of "Ulalume" when it was republished in the
                  Providence Journal. Thinks Ingram's paper on Poe in
                  the Temple Bar (June 1874) is very fine, but again
                  she suggests corrections. Poe had no consumptive
                  tendencies; he died unquestionably of inflammation of
                  the brain. Mentions:

                  of his lonely vigils at her grave. Thinks that Poe's

                   William J. Pabodie committed
                  suicide in 1870, just after inheriting $100,000 from
                  his brother. 
                   William F. Gill is scheduled to
                  give a special series of dramatic readings in 
                   Boston. Mrs. Whitman tells the
                  story of having read "Ulalume" in the Whig Review in
                  December 1847 and of how one day when she and Poe
                  were in the 
                   Athenaeum Library, she asked him
                  if he knew the author. He turned, took a bound volume
                  of the magazine, and wrote his name beneath the
                  printed poem. Nearly twenty-six years later, she
                  again found the volume in the library stacks. Poe had
                  then agreed with her that the poem would be better
                  without its last stanza and had so prepared it for
                  republication in the Providence Journal. Mentions 
                   William D. O'Connor's defense of
                   Walt Whitman, The Good Grey
                  Poet.</p>

                  Channings in

                  overcome somewhat her repugnance for his writings,
                  but she has torn out a third of the volume of his
                  poems that he gave to her. A deadly enemy wrote the

            <p>Poe autographs are very rare. Mrs. Whitman is
                  unable to point out any letter in 
                   Rufus Griswold's Memoir of Poe
                  as authentic. Though she has reason to believe many
                  of them are not, it is difficult to prove. Cuts the
                  Preface and Index from her autographed copy of Poe's
                  The Raven and Other Poems and encloses them to
                  Ingram. 
                   William E. Burton has been dead
                  many years. Mrs. Whitman relates her visit to the Poe
                  cottage in 1856. Miss 
                   Anna Blackwell boarded at the
                  cottage for several weeks in 1847. Mentions: Poe's
                  reading of "The Raven" at one of

            <p>The mournful heritage of madness in Ingram's
                  household creates a closer bond of sympathy between
                  him and Mrs. Whitman, for she has long been
                  subservient to the fluctuating moods of her dear
                  sister, Anna, whose insanity compels her to lead a
                  life of comparative seclusion, or to have all social
                  relations obstructed and complicated. Mrs. Whitman
                  describes 
                   William D. O'Connor's
                  personality and official situation in 
                   Washington, D. C., Poe's having
                  made two versions of the last line of "Annabel Lee,"
                  the identity of M. L. S., and "Landor's Cottage" as a
                  pendant to Poe's "The Domain of Arnheim."</p>

            <p>Mrs. Whitman worries about Ingram's mental and

                   Maria Clemm told 
                   Sarah Anna Lewis that Poe had
                  written "Annabel Lee" for her, and 
                   Frances S. Osgood was openly
                  scornful at the idea. Mrs. Whitman has no doubt her
                  own "Stanzas for Music" called forth Poe's poem as an
                  expression to her of undying love and remembrance.
                  She relates in detail the painful scenes in her home
                  when she parted from Poe. Mentions:

                  1845 edition of Poe's poems and of Eureka are to be
                  his, too. She offers to share a lock of Poe's hair
                  with Ingram. The palpable forgery "MS. Found in a
                  Barn" demonstrates the interest still evoked by Poe's
                  name. Poe's friends have declined 
                   George W. Childs' offer to erect
                  a monument over Poe's grave.</p>

                   Anna Blackwell described to Mrs.
                  Whitman the interior of the Poe cottage, the two
                  parlor tables made by Poe and covered with green
                  baize held with brass-headed nails. 
                   Jane E. Locke visited the Poe
                  cottage in June 1848. 
                   Frances S. Osgood was not a true
                  friend of Poe if she did endorse 
                   Rufus Griswold's estimate of his
                  intercourse with "men." Mrs. Whitman has been told
                  that 
                   Maria Clemm professed to believe
                  Rosalie was the child of the nurse who had charge of
                  her in her infancy. Mrs. Clemm did not inspire Mrs.
                  Whitman with confidence in her sincerity, but she did
                  love Poe and Virginia, and Poe believed in her, at
                  least. Mentions: 
                   Sarah Anna Lewis,

            <p>Mrs. Whitman does not wonder that 
                   Sarah Anna Lewis thought Poe "an
                  angel." Despite his irregularities, Mrs. Whitman
                  always felt that he was essentially noble, gentle,
                  and good. 
                   George W. Eveleth writes that Poe
                  said he meant "The Mystery of Marie Roget" to mystify
                  the reader. Mrs. Whitman has written to 
                   John Neal. She knows "by
                  instinct" that Poe was descended from the Le Poers.
                  Her relatives thought that Mrs. Whitman's father
                  strongly resembled 
                   George Poe of 
                   Georgetown. She agrees that
                  Ingram was appointed for his Poe work; he is equipped
                  to be Poe's champion as no other ever was or could
                  be. She has only five copies of 
                   Edgar Poe and His Critics left.
                  Mentions: Ingram's article on Poe's early poems in
                  Every Saturday, 
                   James W. Davidson, Reverend

                   William D. O'Connor thinks
                  Ingram's article in the August Eclectic, from the
                  Temple Bar, not savage enough on 
                   Rufus Griswold. Three Baltimore
                  editors are roused by the renewed interest in Poe.
                  Mrs. Whitman has just seen for the first time a copy
                  of the 1831 edition of Poe's poems, recently
                  purchased by 
                   Caleb Harris, who clearly
                  recalls having seen an allusion to a volume of poems
                  called Tamerlane and published in 
                   Boston. She offers a critical
                  estimate of 
                   James Hannay's edition of Poe's
                  poems (London, 1853). She reports that 
                   Caleb Harris's consternation
                  over her having cut the pages from Poe's presentation
                  copy of his 1845 edition of poems has caused her to
                  promise to give him the book when Ingram returns the
                  leaves. Mrs. Whitman concludes cryptically that if
                  she "had never seen Poe intoxicated, [she would]
                  never have consented to marry him; had he kept his
                  promise never again to taste wine, [she would] never
                  have broken the engagement." Mentions: article by 
                   M. J. Lamb in Appleton's Journal,
                  18 July 1874, about Poe's house at Fordham; 
                   Leslie Stephen's disparaging
                  remarks about Poe and praise of 
                   Nathaniel Hawthorne in Fraser;

                   Roden Noel on Byron; Poe's

            <p>Mrs. Whitman believes in the stars and the great
                  truths of the occult sciences. She once made an
                  anagram of her name, 
                   Sarah Helen Poer : "Ah Seraph
                  Lenore." To have heard Poe read "Ulalume" or "The
                  Bridal Ballad" is a never-to-be-forgotten memory. She
                  is enjoying this summer beyond any in her life; she
                  has unmistakable "tokens" of the presence of loved
                  ones ever near. Mentions: illustrations in various
                  editions of Poe's works,

                   Robert E. Lee. When time

            <p>A woman's married name is not to be used in
                  evolving anagrams that reveal the secrets of her
                  destiny. Mrs. Whitman is delighted to learn from
                  Ingram that his name means "Son of the Raven." She
                  thinks her 
                   Edgar Poe and His Critics will be
                  better understood later as revealing one dominant
                  phase of Poe's genius. 
                   William F. Gill is disturbed that
                  Ingram's Memoir will take the wind out of his sails,
                  and Mrs. Whitman believes Gill already has too much
                  wind for his amount of ballast on board. She did not
                  recognize 
                   Rufus Griswold when she met him
                  briefly at 
                   Alice Cary's home in 
                   New York ; his appearance was
                  much altered, and he turned away in confusion. Gill
                  claims to have got from 
                   George R. Graham much fresh
                  information that is damaging to Griswold and says
                  that he has a magazine article prepared that is very
                  strong against Griswold. Mrs. Whitman directs Ingram
                  to destroy or keep anything she sends to him, unless
                  she expressly requests its return. Mentions:

            <p>The New York Tribune has a long notice of Ingram's
                  forthcoming edition of Poe's works. 
                   Caleb Fiske Harris "feels sure"
                  there was an 1827 edition of Poe's poems, and he
                  thinks 
                   Richard Henry Stoddard's article
                  in the Aldine on Poe was written with malicious
                  intent. Colonel 
                   Gamaliel Lyman Dwight reports
                  from 
                   Germany that students there pour
                  over Poe's works. 
                   George Ripley noticed Mrs.
                  Whitman's poems in the Tribune, 14 November 1853.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Whitman has received the first volume of
                  Ingram's edition of Poe's works and thinks the Memoir
                  cannot fail to refute 
                   Rufus Griswold's fabrications. 
                   John Nelson Arnold, the artist,
                  admires the reproduction of Poe's portrait. Senator 
                   Henry Bowen Anthony, who knew
                  Poe, thinks the portrait fine.</p>

            <p>Morison encloses copies of 
                   Maria Clemm's letters to 
                   Neilson Poe. 
                   Nathan C. Brooks still lives in 
                   Baltimore. Poe's father was
                  disowned by his family because he married an actress.
                   Neilson Poe planned in 1860 to
                  write a Memoir of Edgar but never wrote anything. He
                  has told Morison that a single glass of wine would
                  set Edgar's brain on fire, that he took care of Edgar
                  in his last sickness, had him suitably buried, and
                  ordered a tombstone that was destroyed by a railroad
                  car that jumped the track, that Poe's brother,
                  William Henry, was even more a genius than Edgar,
                  that it was William Henry who went to Greece and
                  Russia and got into trouble, not Edgar, and that
                  Edgar and Virginia were first married in 
                   Christ's Church in 
                   Baltimore by the Reverend 
                   John Johns. Though the true
                  story of Edgar's death has never been told, Neilson
                  might not be willing to tell it. In her letters to
                  Neilson, Mrs. Clemm denies that Edgar was ever
                  unfaithful to Virginia and that he attempted to
                  seduce the second Mrs. Allan.</p>

                  by both 
                   Caleb Fiske Harris and herself.
                  Hon. 
                   John Russell Bartlett, when a
                  partner in the publishing firm of 
                   Bartlett and Welford, lived on
                  the same street as Poe in 
                   New York. He never saw Poe
                  stimulated by anything other than strong coffee,
                  which he drank freely. 
                   Frances S. Osgood was an intimate
                  friend of the Bartletts, and Poe often visited them
                  when she was staying in their home. Poe told Mrs.
                  Whitman that he was born on 19 January, but did not
                  give the year.</p>

                  believes Mrs. Smith relied on her imagination for the

                   Mary Gove Nichols and her novel

                   Marie Louise Shew (Mrs.

                   Caleb Fiske Harris found in 
                   New York a copy of the 1829
                  edition of Poe's poems and hired a copyist to make a
                  list of the contents which Mrs. Whitman copies and
                  encloses to Ingram. 
                   Samuel Kettell's Specimens of
                  American Poetry proves there was an 1827 edition
                  also. 
                   Richard Henry Stoddard's Revised
                  Memoir of Poe contains an account of Poe's having
                  bought and charged to 
                   John Allan seventeen broadcloth
                  coats. 
                   Maria Clemm's assertions in
                  reference to Longfellow should be taken cum grano.
                  Mrs. Whitman wishes Ingram's Memoir of Poe had been
                  less personal. Perhaps she will eventually entrust to
                  Ingram all of her letters from Poe.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Whitman criticizes 
                   Mary Gove Nichols' reminiscences
                  of Poe which Ingram has reprinted in part: there was
                  no restlessness in his movements or features, a
                  calmness of eye and gesture, self-control and poise,
                  yes. 
                   Richard Henry Stoddard's new
                  edition of Poe's poems are not complete, since he has
                  omitted the first "To Helen." "For Annie" was written
                  after Poe had succumbed to temptation in 
                   Lowell, MA, and had been nursed
                  by 
                   Annie Richmond ; the poem was
                  first published in a 
                   Boston paper in 1849. 
                   Rufus Griswold's reported offer
                  of $500 for a certain lady's correspondence with Poe
                  can be accounted for because it often has been said
                  that 
                   Maria Clemm left a letter from 
                   Frances S. Osgood where it could
                  be seen by a visitor. Mrs. Whitman encloses a parody
                  of "The Bells" which she assumes to be "a fling" at
                  Stoddard's "Grecian Flute."</p>

                  by pointing out false statements in 
                   Rufus Griswold's Memoir. 
                   Maria Clemm lived in their
                  household until the publication of Poe's works by
                  Griswold gave her support. She encloses as a gift
                  Poe's letter to 
                   Marie Louise Shew (Mrs.
                  Houghton), dated 29 January 1847 [Item 32].</p>

            <p>Mrs. Oakes Smith's thirty-page sketch of Poe
                  amounts to an analysis of his mentality. She met 
                   Rufus Griswold and accused him of
                  having scalped Poe and taken his life. Poe had a warm
                  attachment to 
                   Eliza White and was to have
                  married her. He did not "claim" Virginia as his wife
                  for two years after they were married. She mentions 
                   Sarah Margaret Fuller.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Houghton encloses Poe's letter to her uncle, 
                   Hiram Barney, ca. 1847. She
                  diagnosed Poe's sickness as lesion of the brain which
                  produced insanity when stimulated; Dr. 
                   Valentine Mott confirmed this.
                  Poe dictated to her incidents of his past, including
                  a part of a poem to her called "The Beloved
                  Physician," which he later finished and she bought
                  for $25. She offered to pay 
                   Rufus Griswold to change his
                  Memoir of Poe, leaving her watch and diamond bracelet
                  with him as security; he later said that the book
                  would sell best as it was and that Longfellow and 
                   Maria Clemm approved of it or
                  were reconciled to it. Later, Mrs. Clemm sold the
                  bracelet, returned to her by Griswold, for $300
                  (though this is difficult to believe because it was
                  worth $500), and tried to find Mrs. Houghton in order
                  to return the watch. Poe "often" said that he had
                  never prospered by "honest" writing because "when he
                  wrote a really honest criticism of any author or
                  work, he made himself enemies either from the
                  publishers or the authors." He once predicted that
                  Longfellow would coldly stab his reputation after his
                  death. Poe showed anger when Mrs. Clemm called on
                  Griswold and accepted favors from him. Mrs. Houghton
                  bought 
                   Virginia Poe's coffin, grave
                  clothes, and Edgar's mourning suit. After Virginia's
                  death, she persuaded a gentleman to start a
                  collection for Poe and Mrs. Clemm; General 
                   Winfield Scott contributed $5.
                  She has found a copy of Poe's Tales published by 
                   Wiley and Putnam in 1845 and will
                  send it and a copy of The Raven and Other Poems if
                  Ingram wishes her to do so. She tells the stories of
                  Poe's writing "The Bells" at her house, of 
                   Virginia Poe giving to her a
                  portrait of Poe (since stolen) and a little jewel
                  case that belonged to his mother, and of the
                  miniature of Poe's mother which he possessed being
                  saved at the hospital when he died. Poe never asked
                  Griswold for money, but Mrs. Clemm did. Mrs. Houghton
                  told Poe that he must find a woman strong enough and
                  fond enough of him to manage his affairs or he faced
                  sudden death. She saw Poe intoxicated only once,
                  after he had dined with Griswold; he was not given to
                  drink until madness had begun from other causes; and
                  he was "not a sensualist in his mature manhood." She
                  has the MSS. of "To Mrs. M.L.S." and the valentine to
                  Marie Louise. Poe's old military cloak was used to
                  cover Virginia during her last sickness, and Poe wore
                  it to her funeral. She dislikes 
                   Sarah Anna Lewis.</p>

                  praising 
                   Sarah Anna Lewis' poems was
                  justified by his gratitude for favors received from
                  her. Poe asked 
                   Rufus Griswold to be literary
                  executor. She will write her recollections of Poe for
                  Ingram's use.</p>

            <p>Enclosed in Item 197. Hopkins tried to persuade
                  Poe in 1848 to omit pantheistic elements from his
                  Eureka, but Poe refused, saying, "My whole nature
                  utterly revolts at the idea that there is any Being
                  in the Universe superior to myself!" He and Dr. 
                   Roland S. Houghton on one
                  occasion found Poe "crazy-drunk" and took him home to
                  Fordham, leaving $5 with 
                   Maria Clemm for immediate
                  necessities. Poe thought that the Jesuit fathers at 
                   Fordham College were highly
                  cultivated gentlemen and scholars because they
                  smoked, drank, and played cards like gentlemen and
                  never said a word about religion.</p>

                   Caleb Fiske Harris has sent
                  Ingram his copy of the 1831 edition of Poe's poems. 
                   Edmund Gosse's criticism of
                  Poe's poetry in the Examiner (27 January 1875) is
                  presumptuous; he would appreciate "Ulalume" if he
                  understood its weird symbolism. Mentions: Ingram's
                  article in the International Review and the
                  Athenaeum's notice of his edition of Poe's works.</p>

            <p>Because everyone knew who it was Poe had praised
                  so extravagantly in "To M. L. S--," Mrs. Houghton did
                  not want him to publish "The Beloved Physician." 
                   Rufus Griswold wanted it at one
                  time, and if he got it he must have suppressed it out
                  of enmity to her. Mrs. Houghton encloses MSS. of "To
                  Marie Louise" and another valentine Poe sent to her
                  "a year" later. The day before she died, 
                   Virginia Poe took a worn letter
                  from her portfolio, written by the second Mrs. Allan,
                  in which she acknowledged that she alone had been
                  responsible for 
                   John Allan's neglect of Poe
                  because she thought Poe really might be blood kin to
                  Allan. Griswold must have gotten this letter along
                  with Poe's other papers. She has found in a vase some
                  leaves from the journal she kept while Poe was sick.
                  Poe laughed at the perplexity people showed over the
                  identity of the persons to whom his poems were
                  written.</p>

            <p>Poe was mortified over 
                   Maria Clemm's accepting money
                  from 
                   Sarah Anna Lewis, which obliged
                  him to praise her verse in print; he fled the house
                  to escape her. He had a bundle of his mother's
                  letters and two sketches, one of 
                   Boston harbor, 1808; Mrs. Clemm
                  gave them to 
                   Rosalie Poe. Poe's estimate of 
                   John Henry Hopkins was wrong.
                  Mrs. Clemm dressed very plainly, lectured her
                  hostess, and worshiped the world; had she not covered
                  over many things, many charitable persons in New York
                  would willingly have helped save Poe. Mrs. Houghton
                  has a picture very like the side view she had copied
                  of 
                   Elizabeth Poe. Poe carefully
                  wrote into Mrs. Houghton's album the verse "Like All
                  True Souls of Noble Birth," sent to her by 
                   Mary Gove Nichols. She has two
                  of Poe's letters to her. He always treated her with
                  respect, but he was "so excentric [sic] and so unlike
                  others" that she was forced "to define a position I
                  was bound to take." A man named Jones came to her
                  house recently asking to buy Poe biographical
                  materials. She encloses a letter from 
                   Annie Richmond to her in which
                  Mrs. Clemm is described as treacherous and cruel.</p>

            <p>Poe suffered from "mental isolation, living in
                  dreams and bewildered by the real." He saw nothing
                  wrong in his fulsome praise of 
                   Sarah Anna Lewis's poetry, since
                  he was indebted to her. 
                   Maria Clemm engineered his
                  marriage to Virginia to keep him from marrying 
                   Eliza White, who was capricious
                  and addicted to morphia; but to Poe women were no
                  more than a dream. He appeared to be faithful to
                  Virginia during her lifetime. 
                   Rufus Griswold said that Poe left
                  a bushel basket of letters addressed to him by women.
                  He, Griswold, returned 
                   Elizabeth F. Ellet's letters to
                  her. 
                   Thomas W. White distrusted Poe
                  and was irritated by him. It was said that Poe had
                  tried to seduce his stepmother, the second Mrs.
                  Allan.</p>

                   John Henry Hopkins has returned
                  forty pages of her journal which contain Poe's
                  accounts of having been wounded in a duel in a
                  foreign port, of having written a sensational novel
                  called "Life of an Artist at Home and Abroad," which
                  was later credited to 
                   Eugene Sue, and a poem called
                  "Humanity," credited to 
                   George Sand, and of having been
                  nursed by a Scottish lady to whom he wrote a poem
                  entitled "Holy Eyes." He wrote "The Beloved
                  Physician" two months after Virginia's death. Poe
                  said that his brother was a dashing cavalier with
                  more of the 
                   Poe nature than he himself had.
                  Mrs. Houghton is suspicious and antagonistic toward

                  church services with her. During the first part he
                  followed the service and sang the psalms, but he
                  became excited and rushed out. At the end of the
                  service he reappeared. After that, he called on Dr. 
                   William Augustus Muhlenberg, the
                  pastor. Mrs. Houghton offers to give 
                   Sarah Helen Whitman the jewel
                  case that had belonged to Poe's mother.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Whitman thinks Ingram's article on Poe in the
                  Civil Service Review, ca. 1 April 1875, tears 
                   Richard Henry Stoddard's Memoir
                  of Poe to shreds, but she fears it will cause
                  trouble, since Stoddard controls the New York
                  Tribune. She feels, too, that Ingram has brought her
                  too openly in conflict with Stoddard. The two
                  parodies of "The Bells" were by different writers.

            <p>Responds to Ingram's interest in 
                   Poe genealogy. Poe says that there
                  is no good reason to suppose that Edgar was descended
                  from the 
                   De La Poers. Poe's brother was
                  said to be a poet of genius. 
                   Maria Clemm was married only
                  once. 
                   Virginia Clemm was born in 
                   Baltimore on 13 August 1822 and
                  married Edgar on 16 March 1836.</p>

                  containing his article on Poe. She urges caution in
                  Ingram's accepting as Poe's all that is sent to him
                  as unpublished writings, especially "copies."
                  Something about the reported poem "The Beloved
                  Physician" is "not quite... vraisemblable."
                  Mentions: unfavorable criticism of Ingram's Memoir in
                  the Nation; 
                   Mary Gove Nichols being
                  imaginative;

            <p>Ingram is not to let the 
                   Poe family know that he has the
                  miniature of 
                   Elizabeth Poe and is to try to
                  get the one Poe had with him when he died. 
                   Maria Clemm burned a package of
                  Mrs. Houghton's letters to Poe. Poe spent a year
                  abroad and never betrayed his whereabouts to anyone.
                  Only Virginia knew how he got the scar on his left
                  shoulder. Mrs. Clemm used Mrs. Houghton only when she
                  needed protection and money. It was 
                   Mary Gove Nichols who sent her to
                  visit the 
                   Poe family. Friends wondered that
                  she was not afraid of Poe. Poe's cat ("Caterina")
                  seemed to be possessed; it would not eat when he was
                  absent and was found dead when Mrs. Clemm returned to
                   Fordham for her last load of
                  boxes. Mrs. Houghton says that she had promised 
                   Virginia Poe that she would
                  listen patiently to Poe's lamentation, and Mrs. Clemm
                  reproved her for indulging Poe in his fancies.
                  Mentions: 
                   Sarah Anna Lewis being old and
                  ugly, 
                   David Poe's faithfulness to his
                  wife, Poe's belief that he owed his gifts of
                  intellect and heart to his mother, and his statement
                  that he had burned the sweetest poem he ever wrote in
                  order to conciliate Mrs. Clemm and his father's
                  family.</p>

            <p>
                   Samuel Stillman Osgood's
                  portrait of Poe created the false impression of
                  weakness in his mouth and chin. 
                   Richard Henry Stoddard's article
                  about Poe's mendacity was in the Aldine in the spring
                  of 1873. Mrs. Whitman quotes from Stoddard's letter
                  to her apologizing for appearing to have discredited
                  her statements in 
                   Edgar Poe and His Critics. She
                  does not wish to be drawn into a conflict with him.
                  Mrs. Whitman has received another letter from 
                   Marie Louise Shew Houghton in
                  which she makes "rash charges" against 
                   Maria Clemm and 
                   Sarah Anna Lewis. 
                   William F. Gill has asserted that
                  he furnished Ingram with facts for his Memoir of
                  Poe.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Houghton thinks the MS. of "The Beloved
                  Physician" is in a desk in Pierrepont Manor, 300
                  miles away. Her son Henry says that Poe cut it down
                  to nine stanzas for publication. She promises the MS.
                  of the poem and a letter in which Poe mentions it for
                  Ingram's use in his Memoir of Poe.</p>

                   Rufus Griswold's last years were
                  without dignity or happiness. 
                   Alice Cary, 
                   Mary E. Hewitt, and 
                   Mary Bean championed him; 
                   Sarah Anna Lewis, 
                   Ann S. Stephens, and 
                   Elizabeth F. Ellet pursued him
                  with malice. Poe lived unhappily with Mrs. Lewis for
                  a part of one summer. He was not a lover in the
                  common sense, for his feelings toward women were
                  totally of an ideal kind. Mentions:

                  the 
                   United States in the autumn. 
                   Jane E. Locke has been dead for
                  many years; Poe was her guest in 
                   Lowell in the autumn of 1848, and
                  it was she who introduced him to 
                   Annie Richmond. 
                   Anne Lynch Botta is eminently
                  practical, enterprising, prudent, circumspect, and

            <p>Valentine copies for Ingram a long account, almost
                  certainly the joint work of Mrs. Ellis and 
                   Mary Jane Poitiaux Dixon of 
                   Richmond, which states that
                  Poe's mother died in 1813, casts doubt upon 
                   Rosalie Poe's legitimacy, and
                  claims that Poe was a mischievous youth, that he ran
                  up debts in 
                   Charlottesville for champagne and
                  broadcloth coats which he later gambled away, and
                  that he attempted to force his way into 
                   John Allan's sickroom. 
                   Sarah Elmira Royster Shelton was
                  engaged to marry Poe in 1849, and she gave him money
                  to bear his expenses to 
                   Baltimore. Valentine repeats a
                  rumor that Elizabeth Poe died in a poorhouse. He also
                  sends a copy of her obituary in the Richmond
                  Enquirer, 10 December 1811.</p>

                  copying a life-sized drawing of Byron on the ceiling,

                  on a different subject. Copies of Al Aaraaf were on

                  has discouraged her from detailing for him any more

                  and genius that she has seen, and she anxiously

                  a poem or a few verses for reading at the ceremony
                  when Poe's monument is unveiled. Poe loved Virginia
                  and was faithful to her, although his dangerous power
                  over women subjected him to great temptations. 
                   Rufus Griswold married for money,
                  divorced, and remarried, but the decree of divorce
                  was reversed, and he was sued for bigamy, but he died
                  before the suit came to trial. Poe's criticism of

                  of "Alone" in Scribner's for September, as a

                   William Hand Browne believes that

                  disinterested zeal he has shown in clearing Poe's
                  memory from the fiendish malice of 
                   Rufus Griswold and his followers.
                  Mrs. Whitman's article in reply to 
                   Francis Gerry Fairfield's which
                  claimed that Poe suffered from cerebral epilepsy will
                  soon be printed in the New York Tribune, according to
                  the editor, 
                   Whitelaw Reid. She thinks that 
                   Richard Henry Stoddard has a
                  purchase on the Tribune. Mrs. Whitman comments upon 
                   William J. Widdleton's
                  willingness to preface his next edition of Poe's
                  poems with Ingram's Memoir, upon 
                   J. S. Redfield's 1858 edition of
                  Poe's poems, followed by the small Blue and Gold
                  edition, having an "Original Memoir" which claimed
                  that "Annabel Lee" was addressed to Mrs. Whitman, and
                  upon Dr. 
                   George B. Porteous, who lectured
                  on Poe to raise money for Rosalie, having drowned

                  Monthly for March 1867 is of no value. She relates
                  stories of Poe's meeting and visiting 
                   Jane E. Locke and 
                   Annie Richmond in

                  association with Mrs. Locke. She gives a lengthy
                  account of Poe's urging her to an immediate marriage,
                  of his taking laudanum and his ensuing illness, and
                  of his return to 
                   Providence and the prolonged
                  distressing scenes at her mother's house. She

                   John S. Hart's published letter
                  in the New York Tribune, 17 November 1875, in which
                  he relates the histories of the publication in
                  Sartain's Magazine of "The Bells" and "Annabel Lee."
                  She praises 
                   William Winter's poem that was
                  read at the Poe monument unveiling ceremonies. Poe
                  had spoken to her of 
                   Sarah J. Hale's kindness and
                  liberality to him; Mrs. Hale had published some of
                  Mrs. Whitman's early poems in The Ladies' Wreath in
                  1837. As her death approaches, Mrs. Whitman feels
                  less sensitive about her personal relations with Poe
                  being revealed and is now willing to copy for Ingram
                  or to show to him if he comes to 
                   America the letters from Poe
                  which she has held back. Professor 
                   Joseph Rhodes Buchanan has
                  replied that he cannot find her MS. of Poe's second
                  "To Helen"; he thought he had returned it to her.</p>

            <p>Enclosed in Item 340. Mrs. Whitman learned from 
                   Sallie E. Robins of Ohio that Poe
                  was born in 1809; this information has come from Dr. 
                   Socrates Maupin and 
                   William Wertenbaker of the 
                   University of Virginia. 
                   Maria Clemm had once written to
                  Mrs. Whitman that Poe could never remember dates and
                  had to apply to her; it is possible that it was she
                  who told him he was two years younger than he
                  imagined, for Poe would not consciously have
                  misrepresented his age. The portrait of Poe in 
                   Richard Henry Stoddard's article
                  in Harper's does not resemble either of the two
                  daguerreotypes of him that were taken in 
                   Providence. Mrs. Whitman shares 
                   George W. Eveleth's doubt that
                  Poe "habitually" resorted to intoxicating liquors.
                  She thinks that Ingram admits too much in his
                  references to this subject and that he will see
                  "occasion" to qualify his statements.</p>

                  belonging to a set of wild and dissipated students.
                  He encloses extracts from a letter from 
                   Robert M. T. Hunter to him in
                  which Hunter wrote on 20 May 1875 that Poe's habits
                  were bad when he worked on the Southern Literary
                  Messenger and that he was reckless about money and
                  drinking, although not in the habit of drinking
                  constantly. Hunter remembers that Poe gave strict
                  attention to metre and quantity in Professor 
                   George Long's class at the
                  University.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Whitman has received Ingram's valuable paper
                  on Poe's "Politian" published in the London Magazine.
                  Harper's Weekly (dated 11 December, though issued 7
                  December) has a copy of a daguerreotype of Poe taken
                  ten days before his death. It is the best Mrs.
                  Whitman has seen because it has more of his habitual
                  and characteristic expression than any other. 
                   William D. O'Connor, who has an
                  affectionate interest in Ingram and his proposed
                  biography of Poe, still intends to "pitch into" 
                   Francis Gerry Fairfield himself
                  and has given Mrs. Whitman an intensely amusing
                  account of 
                   William F. Gill's reciting "The
                  Raven" at the Poe monument dedication ceremonies.
                  Mrs. Whitman encloses a newsclipping story about
                  Poe's mother having been a daughter of 
                   Benedict Arnold, who was a

                  credit the story of Poe's mother being a daughter of

            <p>Mrs. Whitman is profoundly grieved and surprised
                  at the tone of Ingram's letter of 13 January. She
                  denies that she was in any way responsible for 
                   William F. Gill's published
                  claim that Ingram was indebted to him for materials
                  he used in his Memoir of Poe; she has given nothing
                  to Gill since Ingram's first letter to her in 1873. 
                   William J. Widdleton possibly had
                  pecuniary reasons for inserting the statement. Mrs.
                  Whitman reminds Ingram that she warned him how
                  difficult his task would be and repeatedly urged him
                  to curb his impetuous spirit and not to believe every
                  new story or to resent every suspected wrong or
                  insult. Although Ingram now has decided to wipe his
                  hands of all Northerners and to give up his work on
                  Poe, Mrs. Whitman will not cease to care for his
                  prosperity and success in any new literary enterprise
                  to which he may devote his genius and talents. The
                  Scribner's facsimile poem published by 
                   Eugene L. Didier was written in
                  the album of 
                   Lucy Holmes Balderston, the wife
                  of Judge 
                   Isaiah Balderston. [See Item

            <p>Mrs. Whitman "had no idea" that her criticisms of
                  Ingram's publications wounded his "feelings" or
                  transgressed "the critical license" he had invited.
                  Poe was not a Sir Galahad, but his faults were not of
                  a nature to alienate her love and loyalty. She
                  believes she has dealt fairly with both 
                   William F. Gill and Ingram. The
                  latter's remark that his Southern correspondents were
                  strictly honorable in answering questions only when
                  they were certain implies that his Northern
                  correspondents willfully misled him. Is this so?</p>

                  copies for Ingram her letter to Gill of 26 February
                  1876, in which she informed Gill that she read his
                  "Reply" with "regret &amp; amazement" and that she
                  thinks he should have abandoned his untenable claim
                  that Ingram had used materials about Poe which had
                  been "assigned" to Gill. She reprimanded Gill for
                  having invited false inferences by quoting
                  incorrectly from letters to her from Poe.</p>

                   William F. Gill's evasive answer
                  to her letter of 26 February now matters little
                  because his creditors, having consented to accept
                  thirteen cents on the dollar, have learned that he
                  withheld $60,000 of his assets, and they intend to
                  hold him to strict account. The publisher's pamphlet
                  in which Gill inserted his "Reply" to Ingram has
                  little circulation, and if Gill returns to the charge
                  against her of having violated the international
                  copyright law, she will meet him herself.</p>

                   William J. Widdleton has recently
                  issued a new volume of Poe's poems, using as an
                  Introduction 
                   William F. Gill's Lotos Leaves
                  article; and 
                   Elizabeth Oakes Smith has
                  republished a portion of her article on Poe in the
                  Home Journal, Wednesday, 15 March, in which she
                  repeats her charge of Poe's insincerity and mentions
                  his "myriad little loves." Poe admired 
                   Ross Wallace's poetry. Mrs.
                  Whitman assures Ingram that she has been "perfectly
                  sincere" with him "about Gill," that she has never
                  wavered in her loyalty to him "as a trusted friend,"
                  and that she has never spoken of him and his work on
                  Poe in any way other than that in which he would have
                  liked. Mrs. Whitman is glad that Ingram found
                  "Siope."</p>

                   William F. Gill's "Reply"
                  punishes Gill for using material Mrs. Whitman had
                  expressly forbidden him to publish and for not
                  submitting to her the MS. of his Lotos Leaves
                  article. Mrs. Whitman alludes to Ingram's having
                  found a copy of Poe's Tamerlane and his plans to
                  publish an article on the suppressed poems. 
                   Caleb Fiske Harris will pay more
                  than any other purchaser if the owner of the copy
                  will sell. A scandalous paragraph attributed to 
                   Elizabeth Oakes Smith is going
                  the rounds of the press saying that Poe's death was
                  caused by a beating he received from the friend of a
                  woman whom he had deceived and betrayed. Mrs. Whitman
                  urges Ingram to ask Mrs. Smith to confirm or to deny
                  this story.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Whitman is very anxious to know on what
                  authority Ingram says that Poe's second "To Helen"
                  was first published in Sartain's Union Magazine and
                  not Graham's Magazine. Professor 
                   William Whitman Bailey, who knew
                   Richard Henry Stoddard when he
                  was editor of the Aldine, presented Mrs. Whitman with
                  a spray of arbutus, and she encloses a copy of the
                  poem she wrote to him to show her gratitude. Bailey
                  shares her and Ingram's opinions of Stoddard's
                  unquestionable hatred of Poe. Mrs. Whitman believes
                  that 
                   George Parsons Lathrop is in
                  league with Poe's enemies and has taken opportunity
                  to assail Poe behind "the flimsy mantle" of 
                   Francis Gerry Fairfield.</p>

            <p>Ingram's challenge to Mrs. Whitman's statement
                  that the second "To Helen" first appeared in Graham's
                  Magazine in the autumn of 1848 "is not a trivial
                  matter." She thinks that he has not dealt frankly
                  with her on this subject and that he is withholding
                  his reasons for calling her to question. 
                   Stephane Mallarme has had a copy
                  of Le Corbeau made for Mrs. Whitman as a present. 
                   Sara S. Rice has written that 
                   Eugene L. Didier, her close
                  friend, proposes to prepare a life of Poe and would
                  be glad to be of service to Mrs. Whitman. 
                   Caleb Fiske Harris advises that
                  Ingram print the twenty-seven poems in Tamerlane
                  without letting it be known where the copy is or that
                  it was signed "By a Bostonian." He also thinks that
                  Ingram might find something of interest in a pamphlet

            <p>Mrs. Whitman thinks that Poe's note on cowardice
                  in "Marginalia" which Ingram wants to suppress is
                  absurd but hardly "hateful." It was, she believes,
                  intended as a play on words. "In all matters not
                  affecting important truths," however, she is heartily
                  in favor of suppressing whatever seems to an editor
                  irrelevant or likely to injure the reputation of his
                  subject. 
                   Caleb Fiske Harris is surprised
                  that Poe's first "To Helen" was not included in
                  Tamerlane. All of Ingram's discoveries about the
                  order of Poe's prose articles, stories, and poems are
                  intensely interesting to her. 
                   Eugene L. Didier thinks the long
                  letter about Poe which Mrs. Whitman wrote to him at
                  his request will have great weight in disproving
                  scandals about him, if it is published exactly as she
                  wrote it. Mrs. Whitman is sure that her treatment of
                  the subject will interest Ingram and meet with his
                  cordial approval. His article on Poe's early poems
                  has been reprinted in the New York Daily Graphic
                  sometime in June or July of 1876.</p>

                  she will place them at his disposal. She believes the

                  and shrinks from allowing the purity of them to be

                  the calumnies that have been heaped on Poe through
                  jealousy and envy, she is willing that Ingram use

                  article, "The Bibliography of 
                   Edgar Poe " in the London
                  Athenaeum, 19 August 1876. After a silence of ten or
                  twelve years, she has written to 
                   Elizabeth Oakes Smith to say that
                  she has not hesitated to deny that Mrs. Oakes Smith
                  was the author of a personal assault on Poe. Mrs.
                  Oakes Smith has replied in a postcard and two "most
                  kind" letters. 
                   William F. Gill has achieved
                  notoriety by sliding down a ravine in the 
                   White Mountains. To Mrs.
                  Whitman, Gill is like the "missing link" or the "Lost

            <p>Poe told Mrs. Whitman of his intention to write a
                  pendant to his "The Domain of Arnheim." The things
                  Ingram writes to Mrs. Whitman about "Landor's
                  Cottage" convinces her that Ingram was "destined" to
                  the work which he is "so effectually performing." 
                   Stephane Mallarme wishes to
                  dedicate to her his volume of translations of Poe's
                  poems. She has related to Mallarme "all" that Poe
                  said to her about "Ulalume." Her feeling now is that
                  Poe's omitting of the closing stanza of "Ulalume" at
                  her request was a mistake because the stanza "is
                  necessary to the comprehension of the poem." Mrs.
                  Whitman tells Ingram of Poe's reading of "Ulalume" to
                  her in the 
                   Providence Athenaeum Library and
                  then signing the bound volume of the American Whig
                  Review, in which it had first appeared. 
                   William F. Gill informs Mrs.
                  Whitman that he proposes to publish a volume on Poe,
                  and Mrs. Whitman has insisted that Gill show her
                  proofs of anything of hers that he uses or anything
                  that he writes relating to her. Gill wanted 
                   William J. Widdleton to publish
                  his things together with 
                   Eugene L. Didier's, but Didier
                  would not consent. Mentions: Poe daguerreotypes and
                  copies made from them, 
                   Mary Osborne, Ingram's obituary
                  of

            <p>Only the intense desire to have full justice done
                  to Poe's memory could have tempted Mrs. Richmond to
                  put her correspondence with Poe in Ingram's hands,
                  but she is certain he will not allow it to be made
                  public. Her remaining letters from Poe are so
                  personal and contain so few allusions "to matters
                  that would interest" Ingram, she is not sure that
                  copying them would be worthwhile, but if Ingram comes
                  to America, she will place the originals in his
                  hands. She is surprised to learn that her MS. copy of
                  "The Bells" is not the original one, for Poe copied
                  it while at her house and left her what she thought
                  was the first copy. One very valuable letter of Poe's
                  belonging to her was in 
                   Maria Clemm's possession.</p>

                   Eugene L. Didier writes in his
                  "Memoir" that Poe's mother had been twice married and
                  that she and Poe's father died in the Richmond
                  theater fire. Ingram is to be very careful not to
                  allow 
                   Maria Clemm's letters, which
                  have Mrs. Whitman's marginal comments, to pass into
                  other hands. To her surprise, Mrs. Whitman's letter
                  to Didier about Poe is printed as an "Introductory
                  Letter" in his volume which she will send to Ingram
                  if he wants it. Baltimoreans seem greatly pleased
                  over Ingram's "Memoir" as he prepared it for the
                  memorial volume which 
                   Sara S. Rice has edited. Mrs.
                  Whitman urges Ingram to change the words "fierce
                  flame" as describing the interest she first aroused
                  in Poe because at that time 
                   Virginia Poe was still alive.

                   Sarah Helen Whitman of 25 January
                  1849 [Item 55]. She encloses a note from

            <p>Mrs. Richmond will search in 
                   Boston for a file of the Flag of
                  Our Union and for a number of Graham's which Ingram
                  needs. She sends all of the letters she received from
                   Maria Clemm before Poe's death;
                  Ingram need not return them. Two or three of Poe's
                  letters to Mrs. Richmond are missing. When Mrs. Clemm
                  visited 
                   Lowell she had access to them,
                  and after she left they were missing. Later, Mrs.
                  Clemm borrowed a letter that never was returned,
                  though she said that she had sent it back. Mrs.
                  Richmond met 
                   William F. Gill through a friend
                  who had urged her to help him prepare a lecture on
                  Poe, and when Gill went to 
                   Baltimore, he borrowed her MS.
                  copy of "The Bells" so that he might read it there
                  with more effect. She is enthusiastic about Ingram's
                  work and is sure that it will be a complete and
                  thorough vindication of that "dear and tenderly

                  She has heard nothing lately about

                  not comprehend the rare opportunities she had when
                  Poe talked because wonder and admiration completely
                  absorbed her. As he related them, the events of his

            <p>Miss Blackwell denies that Ingram could possibly
                  have a copy of a letter written to her by Poe because
                  she had never received one from him. She remembers
                  that she visited the 
                   Poe s at 
                   Fordham in company with someone
                  whose name she now does not recall to deliver a
                  basket of delicacies suitable for an invalid and that
                  Poe had returned that visit. She will not permit
                  Ingram to use her name in connection with the letter
                  or with anything he is writing about Poe. [For a
                  complete text of Poe's letter to Miss Blackwell,
                  written from Fordham on 14 June 1848, see Letters 2:
                  369-371.

            <p>All that Mrs. Whitman has written Ingram about 
                   Anna Blackwell she learned from
                  the lady herself. It was 
                   Mary Gove Nichols who advised 
                   Anna Blackwell to board at the
                  Poe cottage for a few weeks of country air and rest
                  from her literary labors. After Miss Blackwell had
                  given her Poe's letter, Mrs. Whitman gave it to the
                  Hon. 
                   John Russell Bartlett of 
                   Providence for his valuable
                  collection of autographs, and it was he who had
                  allowed her to make the copy which she sent to
                  Ingram. Mrs. Whitman is deeply wounded by the tone of
                  Ingram's letter to her and by his disposition to
                  cross-examine her testimony so peremptorily. She is
                  not aware that 
                   Eugene L. Didier has ever spoken
                  an unkind word about Ingram, and she wonders why they
                  should be enemies.</p>

            <p>The files of the Flag of Our Union and some of
                  Poe's MSS. were destroyed by fire in 1872 or 1873,
                  but Mrs. Richmond knows where there is a collection
                  of Graham's and Burton's Gentleman's Magazine, and if
                  the numbers Ingram wants are among them they will be
                  forwarded. The gossip connected with Poe and 
                   Sarah Helen Whitman, relayed
                  from 
                   Providence by Mr. Richmond's
                  family, came close to putting to an end her
                  correspondence with Poe. Mrs. Richmond is sorry that 
                   William F. Gill ever crossed her
                  path, and her sister, 
                   Sarah Heywood, will write Gill
                  requesting that he not publish her recollections of
                  Poe. 
                   Jane E. Locke was deeply in love
                  with Poe. Since her death, Mrs. Richmond has
                  destroyed a large package of her letters that Poe had
                  sent to her, but she encloses one memento of Mrs.
                  Locke. She has given Poe's MS. of "A Dream Within a
                  Dream" to Mrs. Crane of East Boston, at the
                  intercession of her pastor, Reverend 
                   Warren H. Cudworth.</p>

                  Poe" in the London Athenaeum, 10 February 1877, an
                  unprovoked assault upon herself. Ingram had said that
                  he had lent her copy of the book to "a friend" who
                  wrote the review. Mrs. Whitman considers the matter

                  rude shock to all her previous impressions of the

                  her confidence and criticism, and had hailed her as

                   Maria Clemm always spoke in
                  strong terms of denunciation about the treatment
                  Edgar received from the 
                   Allan family, but Mrs. Richmond
                  thinks that Mrs. Clemm either did not know or would
                  not reveal the real truths of the matter. She does
                  not want to meet 
                   Sarah Helen Whitman but would
                  like to meet 
                   Sarah Elmira Royster Shelton and 
                   Marie Louise Shew Houghton, and
                  she shrinks from 
                   Sarah Anna Lewis. [Item 18 is

                   William F. Gill's biography of
                  Poe reporting in Scribner's that it has been well
                  ascertained that Poe's intoxication was a thing
                  caused by even the smallest quantity of wine and took
                  the form of strange and highly intellectual but
                  deranged orations on abstruse subjects. Eveleth wants
                  to know how this has been ascertained. He points out
                  that even 
                   Rufus Griswold did not charge Poe
                  with habitual use of intoxicants and that 
                   N. P. Willis, 
                   George R. Graham, 
                   Frances S. Osgood, and 
                   Sarah Helen Whitman have said
                  that they never discovered signs of strong drink in
                  Poe. Why do the 
                   New York literati with whom Poe
                  was personally acquainted not come forward to answer
                  these questions about his drinking? Who has reported
                  these "deranged orations"? Were they set down by Poe
                  or by anyone for him? Are they part, or all, of his
                  printed volumes? If so, the disorder assumed is
                  nowhere manifest in the contents. Eveleth does not
                  believe the stories of Poe's common drunkenness or of
                  the crazing power of a drop of wine.</p>

                   William F. Gill has shown himself
                  to be an unscrupulous mountebank by using her sister 
                   Sarah Heywood's recollections of
                  Poe in his volume after she had written him that she
                  wanted to use her paper for an article of her own.
                  Mrs. Richmond has reason to believe that at least one
                  favorable review of Gill's biography was written for
                  a consideration. She never liked Gill, found his
                  personality disagreeable, but when Ingram wrote to
                  her she felt immediately that he "ought to know,"
                  that he "must know," the things she knew about Poe.
                  Poe told her that Flag of Our Union was a miserable
                  paper but that the editors paid well. 
                   Maria Clemm had promised to leave
                  to her all of her papers and letters.

                   William F. Gill's publishing of
                  extracts from letters of Poe to Mrs. Richmond is
                  incomprehensible to her because Gill had only heard
                  her read aloud portions of them some six or seven
                  years earlier and the letters have never been out of
                  her keeping. Bound volumes of Graham's for 1843,
                  1846, and 1848 can be bought in 
                   Boston for $6 for all three. Is
                  that too much? Mrs. Richmond thinks that Gill's
                  scandalous attack on Ingram in the Boston Sunday
                  Herald for 18 November is beneath Ingram's notice.
                  She is sorry that 
                   Marie Louise Shew Houghton has
                  died. 
                   Elizabeth F. Ellet was once Poe's
                  friend, but he said that she exasperated him beyond
                  forgiveness. Poe made remarks about Mrs. Ellet and
                  one or two other literary ladies in a letter to Mrs.
                  Richmond, and for that reason, she suspects, 
                   Maria Clemm wanted to get
                  possession of it.</p>

                   William F. Gill at the Old South
                  Fair and shrank from him as if he had been a reptile.
                  If she can make up her mind to sit for a photograph,
                  Ingram shall have one.</p>

                  Whitman, and a copy of a letter Eveleth wrote to the
                  editor of Scribner's Monthly. Eveleth has used the
                  initials "H. B. W.," which belong to 
                   Helen Bullock Webster, and
                  Ingram is to do the same when he prints the letters.
                  If Ingram can pay a trifle for these copies, it will
                  be welcome, for Eveleth admits that he is poor

                  Eveleth received from Poe except a mere note which
                  was given away years ago to someone who wrote asking
                  for a specimen of Poe's handwriting. Eveleth thinks 
                   John Neal's, 
                   George R. Graham's, and
                  portions of 
                   James Wood Davidson's defenses
                  of Poe had an undercurrent of the 
                   Rufus Griswold slanders while
                  seeming to run in the opposite direction. 
                   John H. B. Latrobe's
                  reminiscences are those of an old man in his second
                  childhood. Ingram is at perfect liberty to reprint
                  Eveleth's letters from Poe but without Eveleth's name
                  or initials. Eveleth prefers not to part with the
                  originals just yet but thinks that by and by he will
                  send them to Ingram, if Ingram intimates an
                  acceptance of them. The question of remuneration lies
                  wholly with Ingram: if none, no grumbling.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Lewis saw much of Poe during the last year of
                  his life and found him sensitive, gentle, and
                  refined. The night before he left New York for
                  Richmond in 1849, he had dinner and spent the night
                  at her home. Having a presentiment that he would
                  never see her again, he asked her to write his life,
                  but she never felt equal to the task. Now Ingram has

            <p>On his return to America, Lowell will send
                  extracts from Poe's letters to him. Lowell visited
                  Poe once in his 
                   New York lodgings, by
                  appointment, and found Poe "a little tipsy." The
                  shape of Poe's head was peculiar: there was
                  "something snakelike about it." Lowell does not
                  intend a moral judgment by this, only "a physical
                  suggestion." All impartial persons who had known Poe
                  were of the opinion that he was untrustworthy.</p>

            <p>The three published numbers of 
                   James Russell Lowell's Pioneer
                  can still be picked up. If Ingram should sell or
                  bequeath his Poe collection, it is to be hoped that
                  it will come to some library in America. An American
                  can better appreciate Poe's malice and fury as a
                  critic of his contemporaries than can one at a
                  distance. Poe gave a tone of vulgar personality to
                  American criticism and was probably a sycophant in
                  the direction of flattery. Higginson suggests that
                  Ingram write to

            <p>Peterson was associated with both 
                   Rufus Griswold and Poe on a
                  magazine and knows and understands their characters
                  thoroughly. Griswold was a coward unchecked by any
                  high sense of honor; he hated and feared Poe; his
                  biography of Poe was a malicious libel. Poe was,
                  conventionally, a gentleman; his great fault was
                  drinking. One or two drinks intoxicated him, and all
                  that he did was done when thus half-demented; his
                  mind was analytical rather than synthetical; he wrote
                  "The Raven" and "The Gold Bug" backwards, and he
                  spent hours discussing secret writing and inventing
                  ciphers.</p>

                   Neilson Poe is kindly disposed
                  towards the memory of Poe, but he is very slow in
                  executing his promises. His wife and daughter feel
                  great repugnance in having 
                   Virginia Poe's picture copied,
                  for it was made after her death and shows
                  unmistakable marks of that fact. Judge Poe has some
                  poetry written by Virginia.</p>

            <p>Enclosed in Item 352. Poe was not his roommate at
                  the 
                   University of Virginia. Poe
                  roomed on the West side of the Lawn, afterwards
                  moving to the West Range. George remembers a
                  "pugilistic combat," but "it was a boyish freak &amp;
                  frolic." Poe was fond of reading other poets and his
                  own poetry to entertain his friends, then suddenly he
                  would begin sketching with charcoal on the walls of
                  his room. He was excitable, restless, at times
                  wayward, melancholic, and morose. In other moods he
                  would be frolicsome, full of fun, and a most
                  attractive and agreeable companion. He was of a
                  delicate mold and slender; his legs were not bowed,
                  and he weighed between 130 and 140 pounds. To calm
                  himself he too often put himself under the influence
                  of wine.</p>

            <p>The tone of Ingram's letter is more gratifying
                  than "the hidden and unexpected blast" he gave
                  Stedman in the London Athenaeum. His article is
                  merely a chapter in a book; after that, Stedman will
                  have done with Poe. He thinks Poe's tales are his
                  finest and strongest work. Stedman is not on friendly
                  terms with 
                   Richard Henry Stoddard but
                  regards him as a man of talent and a formidable

            <p>Mrs. Richmond is terribly shocked to see her
                  letters from Poe printed "word for word" in Ingram's
                  new biography of Poe, for she had assumed that he
                  would "merely give the ideas of the writer." There
                  are things in the letters which might be construed to
                  Poe's disadvantage, and she thought the liberty
                  granted for publication had been restricted and
                  confined to very narrow limits by her injunction that
                  he was to give to the public only what he would have
                  been willing to be known had the letters been
                  addressed to his wife or to his sister. Would he have

                   Sarah Helen Whitman's letters
                  from Poe had she been alive?</p>

            <p>The old vindictiveness against Poe still crops up
                  in the Northern newspapers, partly because they hate
                  the South and partly because some of the old
                  mutual-admiration set still survive and have never
                  forgiven Poe for telling them the truth about
                  themselves. Browne encloses reminiscences of Poe
                  which had been collected by Reverend 
                   John B. Tabb and a copy of the

                  assistance. Browne accompanied this letter with Item

                  Snodgrass. Item 359 enclosed.</p>

                   Charles Ellis,

                  constantly led other youngsters into mischief. 
                   I. F. Allen, 
                   Richmond : Miss 
                   Jane Mackenzie, who educated 
                   Rosalie Poe and to whom Edgar
                  submitted his juvenile poems, said the poems were
                  worthless imitations of Byron, blended with some
                  original nonsense; she tells the story of Poe's
                  having pushed his way into the Allan house during 
                   John Allan's last days. Mr.

                   Richmond : Poe's two natures,
                  tenderness and cruelty, swayed him in turn; at one
                  time, to spite Mrs. Allan, he cut the throat of her
                  pet fawn; he once crossed a ravine on the timbers of
                  an old bridge, to the surprise and admiration of the
                  boys; he recited "Al Aaraaf" for the girls' amusement
                  and laughter. Dr. 
                   George W. Rawlings, 
                   Richmond : attended Poe in one of
                  his drunken spells not long before his death; Poe
                  told him, when his mind was quite clear, that the
                  phantasms of mania were always delightful, that he
                  saw nothing but visions of beauty and heard sweet
                  music. Dr. 
                   [James?] Beale and Dr. 
                   [William P.?] Palmer, 
                   Richmond : Poe was utterly devoid
                  of all moral sense, seemed really incapable of
                  distinguishing between right and wrong. 
                   Lewis E. Harvie, 
                   Amelia County, VA : as a fellow
                  student at the 
                   University of Virginia, he once
                  saw Poe, debauched and raving, lying on the grass and
                  uttering terrible blasphemies. Dr. and Mrs. 
                   Ray Thomas, 
                   Richmond : when in their school
                  after returning from 
                   England, Poe was ambitious,
                  enjoyed 
                   Horace, was good at scanning,
                  had a fight once with 
                   Bill Allen, and read his poems
                  to a theatrical audience in the school; once, as
                  Officer of the Day in the local military company, he
                  put the clock two hours ahead to solve a problem
                  about the military watch, showing by this that he was
                  wholly unreliable.</p>

                   George E. Woodberry has written
                  to Eveleth that it is a pity Poe suffers by his
                  friends as much as by his enemies and that he has
                  seldom seen "a more disingenuous book than Ingram's."
                  In another letter Woodberry has said, "I have no
                  doubt that all the documents published by 
                   [Rufus] Griswold are genuine and
                  ungarbled. Poe's character cannot be sustained,
                  except on the theory that he was of unsound mind. If
                  he was responsible, he was a bad fellow.... His
                  nature was, from the first, of a sinister cast....
                  Griswold, in his facts, is very near the truth....
                  The Conchology is a frightful affair --as plain a
                  theft as ever was. Poe had no capacity for truth
                  telling." Eveleth judges that Woodberry's forthcoming
                  work on Poe is to be Griswold's over again, only more
                  so.</p>

                   University of Virginia. Browne
                  encloses a copy of a letter from 
                   Henry C. Carey to 
                   John P. Kennedy, 8 December
                  1834, sending Kennedy "a small sum" in payment to his
                  "friend" for "one of his tales" (i.e., "MS. Found in

            <p>That stuff about Poe and helium, if there be such
                  a thing, is all newspaper silliness; because Poe
                  wanted his balloon to go higher than any had gone
                  before, he had to suppose a gas lighter than
                  hydrogen. That Poe did anticipate some of the general
                  conclusions of later science, Browne did try to show
                  once in an article. Reverend 
                   John B. Tabb has recently written
                  an epigram on Poe and his critics, especially 
                   George Woodberry, and the
                  enclosed autographed copy is for Ingram's collection.

            <p>D'Unger gives an account of his association with
                  Poe, which began in 1846, of Poe's heavy drinking,
                  glumness, carping, and inability to make and keep
                  friends. He thinks the story of Poe's having been
                  "cooped" is "mere twaddle." Poe was a believer in
                  "spirit friends," spiritualism not then being known.
                  D'Unger was told that it was on a visit to "an
                  improper house" that Poe met a girl named Lenore.</p>

                  curious and unexplained. He finds the book awkward,

                   Rosalie Poe was ever made. She
                  was a nervous, eccentric creature who idolized Edgar,
                  and he was as considerate of her as was possible.

                   Rosalie Poe. She has a
                  water-color portrait of 
                   Sam Poe, Edgar's uncle, who was
                  a local wit and writer of clever verses. She knows of

                   David Poe or of 
                   David Poe, Jr., but she bought
                  an oil painting of Edgar in a 
                   Baltimore shop in 1896. Professor
                   James A. Harrison has a paper in
                  the January Century Magazine entitled "Poe and Mrs.
                  Whitman." Miss Poe has in her possession most of 
                   Sarah Helen Whitman's letters to
                   Maria Clemm from 1859 on.</p>

            <p>Browne has forwarded an article from the
                  Cosmopolitan magazine, the silliest thing about Poe
                  that has yet appeared; the author is probably the
                  wife of one of the younger generation of Poes. Browne
                  has searched the October 1849 newspaper files for the
                  name of the boat that probably brought Poe from 
                   Richmond to 
                   Baltimore, but without success.
                  "Ryan's," where 
                   Joseph W. Walker reported finding
                  Poe ill, was a public house called "Gunner's Hall" at
                  44 E. Lombard Street, which would be in the Fourth
                  Ward. At that time the polls were usually held in the
                  public houses, and the candidates saw that every
                  voter had all the whiskey he wanted.</p>

            <p>Miss Poe has no absolute proof that Edgar was born
                  in 
                   Boston, but it is a family
                  record and a family tradition. The Richmond
                  Times-Dispatch, 17 January, has a photograph of the
                  Reverend 
                   John Buchanan who baptized Edgar
                  in December 1811. Poe's brother William Henry Leonard
                  is said to have written beautiful verses in the album
                  of a woman whom Ingram identifies as a Miss Durham.
                  Edgar's uncle, 
                   Samuel Poe, was the son of
                  General 
                   David Poe and 
                   Elizabeth Cairnes Poe. Miss Poe
                  is "almost certain" that her old portrait of 
                   Edgar Poe was not taken from
                  life; it has been copied by and for Professor 
                   James A. Harrison who plans to
                  use it as he has used some of 
                   Sarah Helen Whitman's letters
                  and many of 
                   Maria Clemm's letters to 
                   Neilson Poe. Ingram has Miss
                  Poe's permission to use these as well as letters from
                   Annie Richmond and 
                   Gabriel Harrison. She encloses a
                  copy of the Latin inscription that was on the stone
                  which 
                   Neilson Poe had prepared for
                  Edgar's grave.</p>

            <p>Browne once wrote a now "forgotten paper of no
                  account" for the New Eclectic magazine in which he
                  plotted Poe's last trip from 
                   Richmond to 
                   Baltimore. He vouches for the
                  validity of the note 
                   Joseph Walker wrote in October
                  1849 to Dr. 
                   Joseph E. Snodgrass asking him to
                  come to Ryans' to help 
                   Edgar Poe ; it was found in a
                  bundle of letters from Poe to Dr. Snodgrass. Browne
                  asks Ingram to write the life of Sir 
                   Francis Nicholson, soldier,
                  statesman, and governor of 
                   Virginia and 
                   Maryland at the close of the
                  seventeenth century. Browne has sent Ingram a report
                  on 
                   James H. Whitty, a map of 
                   Baltimore showing Ryan's place,
                  the place where Poe died, and the place he is buried.
                  He encloses a poem by Reverend

                  the honor of Poe, for Calvocoressi says that there
                  was no complete edition of Poe's works before the
                  twentieth century and points to Professor 
                   James A. Harrison's
                  seventeen-volume edition, published by 
                   T. Y. Crowell in 1902, as proof.
                  Ingram's own edition of 1874, published by 
                   Adam and Charles Black,
                  Edinburg, and the Stedman-Woodberry edition,
                  published by 
                   Stone and Kimball, Chicago,
                  1895, are better, Ingram insists, because on the
                  whole Professor Harrison's edition is bad.</p>

                   Poe family records: children of 
                   William Clemm, Jr., and 
                   Maria Poe Clemm -- 
                   Henry Clemm, born 10 September
                  1818, died young and unmarried; 
                   Maria Clemm, born 22 August
                  1820, died 5 November 1822; 
                   Virginia Elizabeth Clemm, born
                  13 August 1822, baptized by Bishop 
                   James Kemp on 5 November 1822,
                  married to 
                   Edgar Poe by the Reverend Mr.
                  Converse, 
                   Richmond, 16 May 1836, died at 
                   Fordham on 30 January 1847. It is
                  said that 
                   J. P. Morgan and 
                   Dodd, Mead and Company have the
                  most valuable collections of Poeana. Now that Ingram
                  has finished writing his biography of 
                   Thomas Chatterton, he should
                  give his Raven the right of way and push it to a
                  finish and have the "last word" before he is eclipsed
                  by a score of presumptuous amateurs.</p>

                   William Henry Leonard Poe wrote
                  some verses in an album belonging to 
                   Rosa Durham, to whom he was

                   David Poe, from the Baltimore

                  dated 29 August 1835. None of the

                   Neilson Poe, 27 September 1870:
                  "You have been a dear kind son to me. I wish you,

                  last note to 
                   Neilson Poe was dated 9 January
                  1871; she died the following month.</p>

                  Cheek," which Poe copied into it. If Ingram wishes,

                   C. Alphonso Smith of the 
                   University of Virginia has a

                  to whom 
                   John Allan wrote on 1 November
                  1824 must be 
                   William Henry Leonard Poe, who
                  was then living with his grandfather in 
                   Baltimore. "Eliza" was the late
                  Mrs. 
                   Henry Herring, sister of 
                   Maria Clemm. Would

                   Annie Richmond, written after

            <p>Fragements of a draft of an account of Ingram's
                  acquaintance with 
                   Algernon Charles Swinburne and
                  with a number of other "most interesting people of 
                   London and 
                   Paris " in the 1870's, including
                  "poets, artists, sculptors, editors, and clubmen."
                  Ingram explains that he became acquainted with
                  Swinburne while attempting "to raise a fund" for the
                  "permanent benefit" of Poe's destitute sister,
                  Rosalie, and he describes how he was drawn" into the
                  maelstrom of [Swinburne's] attraction" by "the
                  nobility of his ideals and the heroic way in which
                  they were advocated" as well as by "the irresistible,
                  inexhaustible music of his poetry." Ingram reports
                  that Swinburne considered Poe "the first true and
                  great genius of 
                   America, " that he preferred Poe
                  to 
                   Nathaniel Hawthorne, that he
                  "commented upon the'nymphomanic habit of body or
                  mind which seems to have regulated the relations of
                  the literary ladies with Poe,' " and that he
                  expressed his appreciation of Ingram's efferts to
                  rescue Poe from the machinations of 
                   Rufus Griswold. Ingram mentions
                  numerous individuals including Baudelaire, 
                   Ford Madox Brown, 
                   Robert Browning, Lord Byron, 
                   George Chapman, 
                   R. H. Horne, 
                   Victor Hugo, 
                   Frederick Locker-Lampson, 
                   Stephane Mallarme, 
                   Edouard Manet, 
                   Christopher Marlowe, the

            <p>Willis suggests that Poe be given a competent
                  annuity so that he can be done with editing magazines
                  and devote his time to belles lettres. Poe's "For

                  where Poe is now buried is singularly appropriate,
                  but if 
                   Maria Clemm wishes, he will
                  consent to Poe's body being moved to 
                   Greenwood Cemetery in 
                   Brooklyn. He is now about to
                  have a slab placed over the grave, with the dates of
                  Poe's birth and death, and a suitable
                  inscription.</p>

                   Thomas Ollive Mabbott, 3 April
                  1965, 1 p. Ingram was of the opinion that 
                   Thomas Cottrell Clarke was the
                  author of this article, but in 1965 Professor Mabbott
                  disputed him, declaring that Major 
                   Mordecai M. Noah had written it.
                  Mabbott, however, made no attempt to explain why the
                  publisher had waited nearly twenty years after Noah's
                  death to print the item.</p>

                  grave in order and adds that the Counting Room of the
                  Post will receive subscriptions for that purpose.</p>

                   George W. Childs of 
                   Philadelphia to erect a monument
                  over Poe's grave has been declined by friends and

                  be the one proposed by the teachers and public school
                  officials, as well as admirers of Poe in

                  to this notice is another paragraph stating that
                  Professor Buchanan had read a chapter of his
                  forthcoming work, Philosophy and Philosophers, to a
                  coterie of literary gentlemen assembled in his home

                  MS. of "To Helen" given to her by Poe, for a

                  in 1845. Because Poe's MS. copy survives, the poem

                  impetus to the movement to place it over Poe's

                   Paul Hamilton Hayne's
                  description of the neglected grave had been widely
                  circulated and thereby brought to the attention of

            <p>Addressing 
                   Francis Gerry Fairfield's
                  contention, Dr. Okie observes that if Poe had indeed
                  been an epileptic, then in the interest of once again
                  having such glorious poetic manifestations, it would
                  be well if the malady were to prove epidemic among
                  the poets.</p>

                   Fordham citizens are surprised
                  that nothing has been done to move 
                   Virginia Poe's remains from

                  husband in

                  effect the removal.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Whitman's recalls her three meetings with
                  Neal and a story of his having published a novel in
                  1823 entitled Randolph which contained "certain
                  strictures" on the 
                   Baltimore lawyer 
                   William Pinckney, who had died
                  just as the volume came from the press. Challenged to
                  a duel by Pinckney's son, Edward, Neal refused and
                  was posted a coward. Within six weeks after the
                  challenge, Neal brought out Errata, another
                  two-volume novel, which purported to be the
                  confessions of "a coward" which tells the story of
                  the challenge and publishes the correspondence
                  concerning it.</p>

                   Edgar Allan Poe : A Memorial

                   Edgar Allan Poe. [These reviews
                  were not altogether Ingram's work; nevertheless, he
                  clearly had a major role in them. He had access to
                  the columns of the Civil Service Review, and he had a
                  "friend" to whom he could give notes and suggestions
                  for reviews, thus enabling him, if occasion demanded,
                  to deny that he was the reviewer.]</p>

                   James Whitcomb Riley as the

                  When asked by an Eastern publisher for the MS., Riley
                  employed an expert penman to copy the verses on the
                  flyleaf of an old copy of Ainsworth's Dictionary,
                  imitating the facsimile of "Alone" that had recently

            <p>Review of the reissue of Ingram's two-volume 
                   Edgar Allan Poe : His Life,
                  Letters and Opinions in a single volume in 1886 by 
                   Minerva Library of Famous Books.
                  [This reissue was widely hailed and reviewed as a
                  "revised" edition, when actually only a very few
                  additions were made to its bibliography, and the
                  index had to be remade to conform to the new
                  pagination. Even such an able Poe scholar as 
                   Killis Campbell spoke of Ingram's
                  "enlarged" biography, when such was not, in fact, the
                  case.]</p>

            <p>Ingram complains that the newspaper's recent
                  account of "Poe, the Cipher Wizard" can be found in
                  his own 1886 
                   Edgar Allan Poe : His Life,
                  Letters and Opinions. Ingram adds that "our American
                  cousins are very fond of extracts from my work; if
                  they would only quote correctly, and without
                  adornments, I should feel more gratified."</p>

                  instant [Item 891]. He makes a detailed comparison
                  between lines from this poem and lines from Poe's
                  later poems.</p>

            <p>Comments upon an article entitled "Even Homer
                  Nods" which appeared in Town and Country on 27 April
                  1901. The Town and Country article cites Poe's
                  seeming error in "The Raven" of having the light from
                  a lamp in the center of the room throw the shadow of
                  the bird on the floor instead of on the wall.</p>

            <p>The letter is prompted by Ingram's complaint that
                  "C. W." had praised 
                   George E. Woodberry's The Life
                  of 
                   Edgar Allan Poe, Personal and
                  Literary, 2 volumes, 1909, an edition which, Ingram
                  insisted, Woodberry pirated so extensively from his
                  work on Poe that it may not be imported into or sold

            <p>Ingram's letter, dated 1 January 1909, protests
                  the wording used in the 
                   James A. Harrison and 
                   Charlotte F. Dailey article ("Poe
                  and Mrs. Whitman --New Light on a Romantic Episode,"
                  Century Magazine). A note from "H" to the Editor,
                  prefacing Ingram's letter, states that Ingram
                  particularly wanted this protest printed in a 
                   Baltimore paper.</p>

            <p>Reports that 
                   John Quincy Adams has discovered
                  a box of mss. and printed matter relating to Poe and
                  his associates. According to 
                   Doris V. Falk, the 
                   John Quincy Adams mentioned was
                  the nephew of 
                   Thomas Holley Chivers and he did
                  have custody of this box of papers. He published
                  articles about them in the Atlanta Constitution in
                  March of 1888 (from which this 1912 paragraph was
                  copied almost verbatim), and again in 1897. The
                  papers remained in the 
                   Adams family until some were bought
                  by the 
                   Huntington Library and others by
                  the 
                   Duke University Library.
                  Mentions: Professor
