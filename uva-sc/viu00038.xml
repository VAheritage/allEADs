      <head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
      <p>One of the most famous mapmakers of the Civil War was Major Jedediah Hotchkiss, a topographical engineer on Confederate General Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson's staff. 
        Some historians believe that Hotchkiss' accurate maps ensured the success of Jackson's 1862 Valley Campaign.
</p>
      <p>Born in New York in 1828, Jed Hotchkiss moved to the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia in 1847 where he earned his living as a schoolteacher. 
        Hotchkiss also supplemented his income as a mining geologist and - though never formally trained as a cartographer - by making maps. He married a 
        Pennsylvanian named Sara Ann Comfort in 1853 and they had two daughters. In 1859, Jed Hotchkiss and his brother Nelson founded the Loch Willow Academy, a school for boys, in Churchville.
</p>
      <p>
 Hotchkiss closed his school in June 1861 and began his military career drawing maps for Confederate General Robert Garnett in western Virginia. In 1862, he secured an appointment on Jackson's staff. 
 "I want you to make me a map of the Valley, from Harpers Ferry to Lexington," Jackson ordered Hotchkiss, "showing all the points of offence and defence in those places." There were very 
 few maps for Hotchkiss to use as a base for his own work, and he usually rode out on horseback to survey the land himself. The Hotchkiss-Jackson combination bred success, for the general's 
 lightning strikes depended heavily on making the most of the terrain. After Jackson's death in 1863, Hotchkiss continued as a topographical engineer with the Confederate forces, traveling with 
 General Richard Ewell to Gettysburg and then, back in Virginia, serving under General Jubal Early. It was one of Hotchkiss' maps that enabled Early to surprise the Federals at Cedar Creek in October 1864.
</p>
      <p>
 After the war ended in 1865, Hotchkiss returned to the Shenandoah Valley, opening an engineering firm and teaching school in Staunton, Virginia. In 1867, he wrote a book with a friend, Jackson's 
 former chief of ordnance William Allen, entitled <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Battlefields of Virginia: Chancellorsville.</title> 
        Hotchkiss died in January 1899 after a successful post-war career as a geologist and engineer.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The papers of Jedediah "Jed" Hotchkiss contain ca. 1550
         items (8 Hollinger boxes, ca. 3 linear feet), and consist
         largely of personal correspondence, bound volumes, and
         business records dating from 1846 to 1912. Included in the
         collection is material pertaining to Hotchkiss' career as a
         teacher and schoolmaster, his period of service under General 
          Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson as a scout
         and map-maker during the Civil War, his later involvement in
         the mapping and development of 
          West Virginia coalfields, and the settling
         of his estate. The collection also includes material
         pertaining to Hotchkiss' son-in-law, 
          Samuel Thomas McCullough, who was a noted
         veteran of the 
          Confederate States of America Army . These
         documents include correspondence, notes, and a set of diaries
         detailing McCullough's experiences in the Civil War. Other
         subjects of possible interest include the papers of the 
          Confederate Monument Association of 
          Staunton, Virginia and 
          Augusta County, Virginia documents
         concerning a 1746 exploration of the 
          Shenandoah Valley , and papers pertaining
         to Loch Willow School and Mossy Creek Academy.</p>
      <p>Early correspondence in the collection is chiefly from members of Hotchkiss' immediate family, who remained in Windsor, New York , when he came to Virginia in 1847. In these letters, his mother and sisters discuss family matters and frequently express their disbelief that Hotchkiss could enjoy his life as a private tutor in the "uncivilized" South. Also among the early correspondence are several poems written by Hotchkiss, dated January 1, 1847; 1854; 1858; and August 7, 1859. The poems appear to be original, and are often addressed to friends.</p>
      <p>In 1853, Jedediah Hotchkiss opened a private school in Augusta County, Virginia called 
          Mossy Creek Academy , and married  Sarah Comfort. In 1855 
          Ellen May "Nellie" Hotchkiss was born, and
          Anna Lydia Hotchkiss followed in 1857.
         Hotchkiss seems to have maintained a close relationship with
         his daughters (particularly with Ellen May, called Nellie)
         throughout his life. In September of 1859, Hotchkiss opened a
         second academy, 
          Loch Willow School, near 
          Staunton, Virginia. Correspondence and
         other records from this period are somewhat scanty, although
         some documents pertaining to 
          Mossy Creek Academy and 
          Loch Willow School have survived and may
         be found in a single folder along with other school
         records.</p>
      <p>In June of 1861, Hotchkiss volunteered for the 
          Confederate army, but was forced to return
         home a few months later when he became ill with typhoid. When,
         by March of 1862, he was recovered, Hotchkiss volunteered his
         services as a scout and map-maker to General 
          Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson.
         Correspondence of the Civil War period is limited mostly to
         letters written by Hotchkiss to his young daughter Nellie. Of
         particular interest is a letter dated December 17, 1862, in
         which Hotchkiss describes the Battle of 
          Fredricksburg and includes a detailed map
         of troops and terrain. Other letters written to Nellie during
         the war vividly describe life in the 
          Confederate camps, and are dated January
         25, March 27, and October 25, 1863. Included in the collection
         is a letter written to Brigadier General 
          Edward Johnson by General 
          Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson, dated May
         4, 1862 and dealing with map-making commissions. Also included
         in the correspondence is a copy of a set of field notes made
         by Captain 
          J. K. Boswell of the 
          Confederate Army on May 1, 1863, at the
         Battle of 
          Chancellorsville. These notes were taken
         from Boswell's body by Hotchkiss after the officer was killed
         in the fighting.</p>
      <p>After the war, Hotchkiss returned to his family and briefly
         re-opened 
          Loch Willow School, also teaching at 
          Augusta Female Seminary, before becoming
         involved in business ventures involving the development of
         rich coal-fields in 
          West Virginia. Hotchkiss also published a
         mining journal, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Virginias,</title> in the hopes of generating
         interest in the natural resources of the region.</p>
      <p>Later correspondence includes many letters to his daughter
         Nellie, as well as letters from friends and associates
         concerning his great interest in geology and geography. It was
         during this period that Hotchkiss was commissioned to make
         maps for many government and private organizations. Three
         letters from General 
          Robert E. Lee, dated December 16, 1868;
         October 20, 1869, and December 24, 1869 are included in this
         material. They deal with Hotchkiss' maps of areas in 
          Virginia. Later private correspondence
         often deals with reminiscences of the Civil War, and a letter
         dated July 5, 1895, written by Hotchkiss to the widow of 
          "Stonewall" Jackson, concerns a biography
         of the late General. Also relating to the Civil War is an
         extensive series of correspondence between Hotchkiss and
         fellow veteran Dr. 
          Hunter McGuire. These letters were mostly
         written between 1893 and 1898, and often deal with books and
         articles on Civil War battles, especially those in which
         General Jackson's forces were involved. This correspondence
         has been grouped together into one folder.</p>
      <p>Other correspondence includes that of the family of
         Hotchkiss' second daughter 
          Anna Lydia Hotchkiss, who marrried 
          Allan M. Howison. Cards, some limited
         correspondence, various theatrical programmes, and two
         certificates, dated July 2, 1879 and June 7, 1881 concerning
         Howison's military career, make up this series. 
          Allan Howison was later employed by
         Hotchkiss' mining company, 
          "The Grottoes." 
          Jed Hotchkiss died on January 17, 1899,
         and the final group of correspondence deals with the
         settlement of his estate.</p>
      <p>The financial and legal records of the Hotchkiss papers
         consist largely of documents pertaining to post-war business
         ventures, including map-making commissions, attempts to open
         up the coal regions of 
          West Virginia, involvements in 
          The Grottoes Company, two business trips
         to 
          England in 1872 and 1873, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Virginias</title> journal, and the settlement of Hotchkiss' estate, as well as general records of purchases and
         sales.</p>
      <p>One folder contains the records of the 
          Confederate Monument Association of Staunton and
         Augusta County. This group was organized in 1906
         with the purpose of establishing a memorial to local men who
         had been killed in the Civil War. Hotchkiss' daughter Anna
         Lydia was the recording secretary for the organization. The
         records include a 1906 circular letter explaining the purposes
         of the group, pamphlets of by-laws, various advertisements
         from monument companies and masons, and letters and souvenirs
         concerning fundraisers and statue unveilings. Photographs of 
          Confederate monuments and statues,
         possibly from the organization's files, are located in a
         separate folder.</p>
      <p>The Hotchkiss papers also includes a typed transcript entitled "Running the line from the head of the Rappahannock to the head of the Potomac" 
        of the 1746 diary of Thomas Lewis concerning the establishment of the Fairfax line. There is a note by Hotchkiss signed an dated Oct. 1889 that states the transcription 
        was "copied and verified from original." The papers include a letter from William Cabell Rives, 1883 April 27, to Hotchkiss discussion Thomas Walker's journal; 
        there is also a document [in Rives' hand?] summarizing Walker's journal from March 16 though July 12, 1750. There is also a typescript of a speech by Col. Stoddard Johnston 
        on Walker's journal read before the Filson Club November 3, 1893.</p>
      <p>One folder contains miscellaneous historical essays and
         speeches which appear to have been written mainly by 
          Jed Hotchkiss and Dr. Hunter McGuire on such topics as <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Stonewall Jackson's Cap,</title><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">The Seven Day's Fighting Around Richmond,</title><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Shenandaoh Valley,</title><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Form of Government in Virginia -A Geographical and Political Summary,</title> and a memorial address delivered at London Park Cemetary, Baltimore,
         Maryland in 1875.</p>
      <p>Two folders contain miscellaneous school and lecture notes
         for classes taught by Hotchkiss at 
          Mossy Creek and 
          Loch Willow schools. These are undated and
         deal with a wide variety of subjects. Also included are
         lectures for Sunday School classes and sermons. A third folder
         contains school records and related material, including
         documents pertaining to the education of 
          Jed Hotchkiss at 
          Windsor Academy in New York, and of 
          Sarah Comfort Hotchkiss at the 
          Wyoming Seminary. Also included are
         papers concerning Hotchkiss' career as a schoolmaster.</p>
      <p>Photographs are to be found in two folders, one of which
         consists mostly of pictures of family members. The second
         folder contains photographs of statues and monuments
         associated with the 
          Confederate Monument Association.
         Additional photographs (often of better quality) are located
         in the Prints File under such categories as "Hotchkiss," 
          "Staunton" and 
          "Augusta County." Of special interest are
         photographs, of Hotchkiss, his wife and daughters, their 
          Staunton home 
          "The Oaks", 
          Loch Willow School, 
          Mossy Creek Academy, and the 
          Augusta Female Seminary, and a
         daguerrotype of Hotchkiss and his two daughters.</p>
      <p>Material relating to 
          Confederate soldier 
          Samuel Thomas McCullough is to be found
         among the collection's correspondence and bound volumes. The
         correspondence has been grouped into one folder and dates from
         1862 to 1865. This material consists largely of letters
         written by Lieutenant McCullough of 
          Company D, 2nd Maryland Infantry
         Regiment, to his father and brother during his
         service in the 
          Confederate Army and while a prisoner of
         war at 
          Johnson's Island Prison in 
          Ohio. Also included are items such as
         pay-master's receipts, authorization for leaves of absence,
         and documents from the prison on 
          Johnson's Island. In addition to this
         material, the collection also includes a seven-volume set of
         diaries, which record McCullough's experiences as a soldier
         from August 11, 1862 to June 22, 1865. These diaries have been
         microfilmed (M-2373), and a separate, more
         detailed guide is available. Also in the collection are three
         small notebooks in which McCullough details an 1878 expedition
         to revisit many of the campsites and battlefields of his Civil
         War days. These notebooks are among the bound volumes of the 
          Jed Hotchkiss papers.</p>
      <p>Bound volumes make up a large percentage of the collection,
         consist mainly of miscellaneous hand-written notes. Three
         large letter-press books include business correspondence from
         1891 to 1898. Four volumes of map-making notes, including a
         report on Buffalo Creek, Fayette County, West Virginia, and a book of maps of 
          Augusta County, Virginia are included.
         Seven books contain business-related notes, and two of these
         volumes consist of subscription lists for <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Virginias,</title> ca. 1882. Eight additional bound
         volumes include personal notes such as diaries for the years
         1845, 1895, and 1897, as well as Hotchkiss' Index Rerum (ca.
         1854) and a notebook detailing the building of an addition to 
          "The Oaks" in 1888. Six scrapbooks are
         part of the collection, and include a pressed-flower album, a
         forestry album, a small booklet of 
          Virginia railway charts, and an album of
         newspaper clippings dating from approximately 1864 to 1885.
         Other scrapbooks include two albums belonging to Hotchkiss'
         wife Sarah Comfort Hotchkiss, and his daughter
          Nellie Hotchkiss McCullough. The former
         volume consists mainly of pictures and newspaper clippings,
         while the latter is an album of embroidery patterns. The seven
          Samuel Thomas McCullough Civil War diaries
         and three notebooks of his 1878 battlefield tour are among the
         bound volumes of the Hotchkiss collection.</p>
      <p>An oversize folder contains several items related to the
         collection, including blueprints of Hotchkiss' 
          Staunton home, 
          "The Oaks," architectural drawings, maps,
         large documents, and broadsides. A complete listing appears
         later in this guide.</p>
      <p>Items of memorabilia include twenty-three
         souvenir ribbons relating to Confederate Veteran's
         Association functions and other events. Other items
         include an 1866 watercolor paint box belonging to 
          Nellie Hotchkiss McCullough, a souvenir
         spoon from the birthplace of "Stonewall" Jackson, the 
          Confederate belt-buckle and spur of an
         unidentified soldier killed at 
          Fisher's Hill, Virginia, a pocket-knife
         used by Jed Hotchkiss from 1862 to 1868, an
         embroidered handkerchief belonging to 
          Sarah Comfort Hotchkiss, and a lapel-pin
         featuring a mining symbol. The remainder of the memorabilia in
         the collection consists of eleven souvenir coins and medals
         ranging in date from 1883 to 1898. These coins and medals are
         from events such as Confederate monument unveilings and
         World's Fairs. A complete listing appears later in this
         guide.</p>
