      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The only son of Uriah and Audie Schuyler (Stille) Cummings,
         Homer Stille Cummings was born in Chicago, Illinois, on 30
         April 1870. He received his early education at the Heathcote
         School in Buffalo, New York. In 1891, he graduated from Yale
         University with the degree of Bachelor of Philosophy, and two
         years later, he took an LL.B. degre from Yale Law School.
         Subsequently, he received several honorary degrees in law,
         from Rollins College, Lake Forest Univesity, and Oglethorpe
         University, in 1934, Lincoln Memorial University and John
         Marshall College of Law, in 1935, and Pennsylvania Military
         College in 1938. Admitted to the Connecticut STate Bar, he
         commenced in 1895 a long legal career by practicing law in
         Stamford where he became a member of the firm of Fessenden,
         Carter, and Cummings. He practiced alone from 1900 to 1909,
         then organizing the firm of Cummings and Lockwood with Charles
         D. Lockwood.</p>
      <p>In 1900, Cummings was elected mayor of Stamford, and
         subsequently twice re-elected. For two years, he was president
         of the Mayor's Association of Connecticut, and from 1903 to
         1909, president of the Stamford Board of Trade. Elected
         delegate to the Democratic National Convention and Democratic
         National Committeeman for Connecticut in 1900, he held the
         latter position of twenty-five years. He was nominated by his
         party for the position of representative-at-large in Congress,
         but the Republican majority in Connecticut was such that there
         was little chance of election. From 1913 to 1919, he was
         vice-chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Cummings
         was early on a strong supporter of Woodrow Wilson, and
         identified with the progressive wing of the Democratic
         party.</p>
      <p>Cummings served as state's attorney for Fairfield County
         from 1914 to 1924. During this period, he was involved in the
         famous case of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">State V. Harold Israel</title>in which
         he successfully cleared an innocent man of a murder charge.
         During World War I, Cummings was a member of the Connecticut
         State Council of Defense. In 1916, he was the Democratic
         candidate for the U.S. Senate, losing by a narrow margin. He
         was elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee in
         1919, and was chosen temporary chairman of the Democratic
         National Convention at San Francisco in 1920. His keynote
         speech at the convention staunchly defended the
         accomplishments of the Wilson administration. Again a delegate
         to the party convention in 1924 in New York, he was a leader
         of the McAdoo forces, and was chairman of the committee on
         resolutions.</p>
      <p>In 1925, Cummings resigned from the Democratic National
         Committee to devote himself to the practice of law. He acted
         as special trial counsel in important cases in many
         jurisdictions, and gained further experience in the areas of
         monopoly, civil rights, and procedure. In 1930, Governor
         Trumbull appointed him head of an investigation of conditions
         at the Connecticut State Prison.</p>
      <p>Cummings was a firm supporter of Franklin Delano Roosevelt
         in 1932 and assisted in the organization of his campaign. A
         delegate-at-large to the Chicago convention of the party, he
         acted as one of the floor leaders for Roosevelt and made a
         speech seconding his nomination. He campaigned actively for
         Roosevelt in the months that followed. After the election, it
         was announced that Cummings had been offered the position of
         governor-general of the Philippines. But on the sudden death
         of Senator Thomas J. Walsh, who had been selected for the post
         of attorney general, Roosevelt drafted Cummings for this post.
         It was at first assumed that Cummings would serve only
         temporarily and that he would eventually assume the
         Philippines post, but his work as attorney general was so
         valuable that the president asked him to remain.</p>
      <p>Cummings played an influential role in the Roosevelt
         administration. In the early days of 1933, he assisted the
         president by drawing up emergency legislation such as the
         Emergency Banking Act, and several executive orders relating
         to gold. He reorganized the Department of Justice, and greatly
         strengthened the power of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
         by proposing comprehensive anti-crime legislation relating to
         kidnapping, national bank robbery, extortion, and
         racketeering. Personally interested in the prison division of
         the department, hew as responsible for substantial
         improvements in the federal penal system. Many new
         institutions, including Alcatraz Prison, were constructed
         under his administration. Cummings attempted to break up
         monopolies, and directed the Justice Department to start
         proceedings against some of the large oil companies. In his
         own opinion, his most important accomplishment was the reform
         of civil procedure in the federal courts. He persuaded
         Congress to pass a law giving the justices of the Supreme
         Court authority to prepare and promulgate, in September 1938,
         uniform rules of practice in the federal courts. The purpose
         of this measure was the elimination of as much legal
         technicality and red tape as possible from the federal
         judicial system.</p>
      <p>In his first four years in the cabinet, Cummings was asked
         to defend the constitutionality of many New Deal enactments.
         He was successful in the case of dollar devaluation, the
         Tennessee Valley Authority, the Securities and Exchange
         Commission, and other measures, as they were upheld by the
         Supreme Court. But Roosevelt was frustrated by the fact that
         the court did declare unconstitutional some important New Deal
         enactments including the National Recovery Administration. The
         president's dismay set the stage for the most controversial
         episode in Cummings' career, the Supreme Court Reorganization
         Bill, better known as the court-packing bill. Cummings
         suggested a plan by which the president could appoint a new
         justice or federal judge to the bench for each judge who had
         served at least ten years, who waited more than six months
         after his seventieth birthday to resign or retire. The
         president would be allowed to appoint up to six new justices
         to the Supreme Court, and forty-five new judges to lower
         federal tribunals. The result , of this plan, Cummings and
         Roosevelt hoped, would be the appointment of men of a more
         liberal attitude, better disposed toward the New Deal
         philosophy than the sitting justices. The president attempted
         to present the bill as a proposal designed to maximize
         efficiency, but his true intentions were obvious. Spring on an
         unsuspecting Congress and nation in February 1937, the
         court-packing bill aroused widespread opposition; many people
         interpreted the plan as an attack on the Supreme Court and the
         Constitution. The bill was ultimately defeated by the senate,
         but it destroyed Democratic unity and strengthened the
         anti-New Deal coalition in the process. Cummings was
         subsequently involved in a primary "purge" campaign, in which
         the administration attempted to unseat some of the Democrats
         in Congress who had assisted in the defeat of the
         court-packing measure.</p>
      <p>In 1938, Cummings was chosen by Argentina and Chile to
         arbitrate the Beagle Channel Islands controversy. Cummings
         resigned his post on January 2, 1939, and practiced law in
         Washington with the firm of Cummings and Stanley, subsequently
         Cummings, Stanley, Truitt, and Cross. He personally argued
         many cases in circuit courts and in the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>He was the author of four books: 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Liberty Under Law and
         Administration</title>(1934); 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Federal Justice</title>, with Carl
         McFarland (1937); 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">We Can Prevent Crime</title>(1937); and
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Tired Sea</title>(1939) as well as
         numerous articles and speeches.</p>
      <p>Cummings was a member of the First Congregational Church,
         Stamford, and a trustee of George Washington University. He
         belonged to many organizations, including the American Society
         of International Law, the American Law Institute, the American
         Judicature Society, the Yale, Metropolitan, and Burning Tree
         Clubs, the Masons, Old Fellows, Elks, Eagles, Phi Alpha Delta,
         and Omicron Delta Kappa.</p>
      <p>Cummings married Helen Woodruff Smith in June 1897. They
         had one son, Dickinson Schuyler Cummings, born in June 1898.
         They were divorced in October 1907. In December 1909, Cummings
         married Marguerite T. Owings, from whom he was divorced in
         1928. He married May Cecilia Waterbury in August 1929. She
         died in 1939. In 1942, he married Julia Alter, who died in
         February 1955. Cummings died of heart failure at his home on
         September 11, 1956, at the age of eighty-six.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers of Homer Stille Cummings consist of 171.2 feet
         (ca. 124,000 items) of correspondence, memoranda, diaries,
         speeches, articles, legal case files, daily schedules,
         photographs, daguerreotypes, engravings, newspaper clippings,
         scrapbooks, films, phonograph records, memorabilia, and other
         items, for the years 1850 (1890-1956) relating to Cummings'
         long career as lawyer, Democratic Party leader, and attorney
         general in the administration of President Franklin D.
         Roosevelt. Family, legal, political, and official papers
         reflect Cummings' far-ranging activities and interests; the
         value of the papers lies in their unusual scope and breadth.
         The collection includes Cummings' correspondence, telegrams,
         and memoranda with Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt,
         and a group of papers that document his role in the historic
         court-packing struggle.</p>
      <p>Cummings' political papers fall into two major categories,
         one group ranging from 1899 to 1933, and the second from the
         time he assumed a post in the Roosevelt cabinet until his
         death in 1956. There are few papers, unfortunately, relating
         to his tenure as mayor of Stamford, Connecticut. The bulk of
         the material in the first category was generated by his
         service with the Democratic National Committee; the
         corresponded between Cummings and Wilson, which resolves
         around party politics, national affairs, and various
         individuals, sheds light on Wilson and politician. In a number
         of interesting memoranda, Cummings discussed Wilson and
         described various meetings with him. In his capacities as
         vice-chairman and then chairman of the National Committee,
         Cummings corresponded extensively with Democratic party
         leaders and government officials, including Vance c.
         McCormick, William G. McAdoo, Cordell Hull, and Edwin M.
         House. His involvement in matters in his home state is
         documented by much material on Connecticut politics, the
         investigation of the Connecticut State prison at Wethersfield
         in 1930, and the Harold Israel case.</p>
      <p>The second group of political papers primarily relate to
         Cummings' tenure as attorney general, and reveal his
         continuing interest in Democratic Party politics. He
         corresponded with many government officials, political
         leaders, members of Congress, and judges, such as Benjamin N.
         Cordozo, James A. Farley, David Fitzgerald, J. Edgar Hoover,
         Robert H. Jackson, and Harry S. Truman. The topics of the
         letters include national affairs, politics, Justice Department
         policy (FBI material has been reviewed and declassified by the
         FBI), judicial reform, and the international situation.
         Cummings' correspondence with Roosevelt reveals the close
         working relationship between the two men and highlights
         Roosevelt's political career. Their letters concern the
         administration of the Justice Department, the progress of New
         Deal legislation, and related juridical matters. Of particular
         interest are correspondence and papers concerning the
         reorganization, or court-packing, plan, and the gold cases.
         Memoranda, case files, circulars, press releases, and printed
         material supplement the correspondence of the attorney
         general.</p>
      <p>The collection includes a number of family papers, ca.
         1890-1956 of Cummings, his mother, wives, and son. Much of
         this material is of a financial and legal nature, relating to
         taxes, divorce proceedings, and estates. There is
         correspondence between Cummings and his wives Marguerite T.
         Owings Cummings, and Julia M. Alter Cummings, and his son
         Dickinson Schuyler Cummings. Letters about the annual Homer S.
         Cummings Golf Tournament, miscellaneous school notebooks and
         travel diaries, are also found here.</p>
      <p>The many speeches and articles included in the collection
         reflect Cummings' own interests and official responsibilities,
         and cover such topics as national and Connecticut politics,
         criminal justice, judicial reorganization, and international
         affairs. There is also speech research material and related
         correspondence. A number of speeches by other individuals on a
         wide range of subjects, especially members of the Justice
         Department speaking on crime suppression, are in the
         collection.</p>
      <p>In Cummings' personal and political diaries, 1919-1956, he
         recorded his daily activities and described meetings, trips,
         and his colleagues. These diaries are a very valuable source
         in themselves, because Cummings was a shrewd and seasoned
         commentator on political affairs. The drafts of his books

         Cummings</title>, and research material for projected books on
         military law and the Lands Division, indicate Cummings'
         research-writing interests. There are many source files, with

      <p>Cummings' flourishing law practice in Stamford,
         Connecticut, and Washington, D.C., is documented by
         correspondence, papers, and many legal case files.</p>
      <p>The Cummings Papers contain a wealth of non-print material
         that is another valuable resource for students of
         twentieth-century America. There are many professional and
         personal photographs of Cummings, his colleagues and family,
         daguerreotypes, and ambrotypes, a series of engravings of the
         attorney generals, political cartoons, and miscellaneous
         certificates. Films, phonograph records, scrapbooks, and
         memorabilia round out the collection. Some of the scrapbooks
         contain correspondence and photographs as well as newspaper
         clippings.</p>

      <p><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">GENERAL BACKGROUND</title><lb/><lb/>The papers arrived at the library largely in folders
         with Cummings' original headings, and in rough chronological
         order. There was a general correspondence file marked "A.G.
         (Attorney General) Personal," with Cummings' correspondence
         and papers for his years as attorney general and beyond, and
         clusters of papers concerning other aspects of his career.
         Cummings' folder headings have been retained, and the folders
         have been groupd in several broad categories, and then
         arranged either chronologically or alphabetically. See the
         specific descriptions below for details. The material within
         each folder is in chronological order. Following is the list

      <p><lb/><emph render="bold">Series II: Political Papers to 1933,
         1899-1933</emph><lb/><lb/>This series includes correspondence and papers on the
         following topics: politics in general, Connecticut politics in
         particular, the Connecticut Women Suffrage Association, and
         the Democratic Town Committee. Cummings' service on the
         Democratic National Committee is amply documented by letters
         concerning strategy, finance, publicity, campaigns, the
         Speakers' Bureau, women's suffrage, and prohibition. He
         corresponded with many political leaders and government
         officials including Newton D. Baker, Josephus Daniels, Carter
         Glass, H.T. Gregory, Edwin M. House, Cordell Hull, W.D.
         Jamieson, William G. Madoo, Vance C. McCormick, J.C.
         McReynolds, and Henry Morgenthau. There is later
         correspondence, ca. 1931-1932, relating to the presidential
         campaign of Franklin D. Roosevelt, with James A. Farley,
         George H. Combs, Louis Howe, Daniel C. Roper, and Frank C.
         Walker. 
         <lb/><lb/>This group includes one box of Woodrow Wilson material,
         including correspondence between Wilson and Cummings, and a
         series of telegrams exchanged by the two when Cummings was
         serving as chairman of the Democratic National Convention in
         1920. The correspondence principally relates to Democratic
         party affairs and the work of the National Committee. There is
         also a draft of a speech by Wilson, and a number of
         interesting and detailed memoranda written by Cummings about
         Wilson. 
         <lb/><lb/>In addition to the political correspondence, there are
         papers relating to the Harold Israel case, and to the
         investigation of the Connecticut State Prison at Wethersfield
         in 1930. 
         <lb/><lb/>The papers are arranged by topic, and the subject
         groupings are placed in a chronological sequence. The material
         within each folder is arranged chronologically. 
         <lb/><lb/><lb/></p>
      <p><lb/><emph render="bold">Series III: Correspondence of the Attorney
         General and from the Post-Attorney General Period,
         1933-1956</emph><lb/><lb/>This series consists of two groups of papers: 1) a
         general correspondence file and 2) miscellaneous papers. 
         <lb/><lb/>1. 
         <emph render="underline">General Correspondence File</emph>:
         Cummings kept his general correspondence files, which was
         labeled "A.G. Personal," when he left his post and continued
         to add to it until his death. It contained political,
         official, and personal correspondence and papers. The heading
         "A.G. Personal" has been retained. A number of folders with
         material that is similar in content, which may well have been
         part of the original file, have been labeled "Correspondence
         of H.S.C.," and interfiled with the "A.G. Personal" folders.
         Some of the files relate to a specific individual, others to a
         topic. The folders have been placed in alphabetical order by
         subject, and the items within each folder in chronological
         order. For each letter of the alphabet, first there are
         several folders marked "General," where correspondence was
         placed for individuals or topics that did not have a separate
         file of their own. 
         <lb/><lb/>This correspondence relates to Cummings' service as
         attorney general, his active involvement in Democratic party
         politics, and general interest in national and international
         affairs. Cummings correspondence with a wide range of
         government officials, members of Congress, judges, Democratic
         leaders, personal friends, and associates. The letters cover
         such areas as Justice Department policy and administration,
         crime, judicial reform, the national political climate, New
         Deal legislation, and foreign affairs, with a focus on Latin
         America. The many persons with whom Cummings correspond
         include Alben Barkley, Benjamin N. Cardozo, Tom C. Clark,
         James A. Farley, David Fitzgerald, Felix Frankfurter, J. Edgar
         Hoover, Robert H. Jackson, Jesse Jones, William A. Julian,
         Brien McMahon, Harlan F. Stone, and Harry L. Truman. Cummings
         maintained files on many organizations, including the American
         Bar Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the
         National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
         There are some interesting files on the Dominican Republic,
         including correspondence between Cummings and Generalissimo
         Trujillo. In addition to the political and official material,
         there are letters of a purely personal nature, largely
         pertaining to Cummings' social life. 
         <lb/><lb/>The researcher is cautioned that the very rich
         correspondence in this group cuts across individual and
         topical areas. Material relating to J. Edgar Hoover, or
         judicial reform, for instance, is contained in many disparate
         folders. 
         <lb/><lb/>Of particular interest is correspondence between
         Cummings and Roosevelt, 1917-1945, which has been placed at
         the end of the first group in the series. The principal topic
         is Democratic party politics, with a focus on Roosevelt's
         political career. The letters also touch on Justice Department
         policy, pending legislation, legal cases, and appointments.
         There is some material here on the court-packing struggle, but
         the researcher is referred as well to the judicial
         reorganization papers in the miscellaneous section of this
         series. Some correspondence of a personal or social nature,
         including invitations and thank-you notes, is contained here,
         as are a few Roosevelt speeches. Finally there are several
         letters from Roosevelt to Cecilia Cummings and a few written
         by Eleanor Roosevelt to Cummings. 
         <lb/><lb/>The "White House" Folders under "Correspondence with
         Government Agencies," in the Miscellaneous section of this
         series also contain correspondence between Cummings and
         Roosevelt. 
         <lb/><lb/>2. 
         <emph render="underline">Miscellaneous Papers</emph>. This is
         an additional group of correspondence, papers, and other items
         generated by Cummings' service as attorney general. The papers
         are arranged alphabetically by topic, and within each topic
         chronologically. The items in each folder are in chronological
         order: 
         <lb/><lb/>a) Cummings' calendar of daily appointments, 1933-1938 
         <lb/><lb/>b) Correspondence of the attorney general with various
         government agencies, 1933-1938: In his official capacity as
         attorney general, Cummings corresponded with staff members of
         other government agencies about matters of mutual concern. Of
         chief interest here is the correspondence with the White
         House, primarily concerning Justice Department affairs.
         Cummings corresponded with Roosevelt, his assistants, and
         secretaries. 
         <lb/><lb/>c) Department of Justice Papers, 1933-1938: (1) Case
         Files: These legal case files are arranged by their designated
         number; (2) "Unclassified" Circulars: These departmental
         circulars were directed mainly to U.S. attorneys, clerks of
         U.S. district courts, and U.S. marshals. They are in
         chronological order; (3) Circulars, Press Releases, and
         Papers: The items have been grouped by topic, such as crime
         suppression, and war risk legislation, and arranged
         alphabetically; (4) Memoranda: Memoranda to and from Cummings
         with various divisions of the Justice Department, such as the
         FBI, the pardon attorney, and subordinates such as Ugo Carusi
         and Alexander Holtzoff, are found here. They are arranged
         alphabetically. Of special interest are the F.B.I. memoranda,
         between Cummings, J. Edgar Hoover, and their assistants. A
         number of Hoover speeches are located in this sections; (5)
         Miscellaneous Items, 1933-1939: A few lists, notes, and other
         papers have been placed at the end of this group. 
         <lb/><lb/>d) Supreme Court Papers: This important group covers the
         gold cases which Cummings argued before the Supreme Court, and
         the controversial Judicial Reorganization (court-packing)
         Plan. (1) Gold Cases, 1933-1938: Correspondence, papers, and
         printed material are included, and are chronologically; (2)
         Judicial Reorganization, ca. 1787- 1952: [a] rough drafts of
         the plan; [b] correspondence and memoranda are grouped by
         subject, and arranged in a chronological sequence; [c]
         hearings are arranged chronologically; [d] speeches are
         arranged chronologically; [e] research material, including
         lists, graphs, notes on historical precedents of the plan, and
         printed material, in that order, chronologically; [f]
         newspaper clippings are in chronological order.

      <p><emph render="bold">Series IV: Speeches and Articles</emph><lb/><lb/>1. 
         <emph render="underline">Speeches, 1886-1950</emph>: This
         series includes speeches by Cummings, speech research
         material, and related correspondence. They reflect his
         interest in law and politics and the progress of his career,
         and can be divided into four distinct periods. 
         <lb/><lb/>The speeches from 1886-1916, delivered at a variety of
         civic and fraternal politics, bimetallism, and Robert Burns,
         and evidence young Cummings' growing political maturity. 
         <lb/><lb/>Speeches for 1916- 1932 include politics, America's role
         in international affairs, and the World Court. 
         <lb/><lb/>A number of national campaign speeches, 1932-1938,
         including Cummings' address seconding the nomination of
         Roosevelt at the Democratic National convention in 1936, are
         contained here. Attorney General Cummings delivered many
         speeches about crime control and the administration of
         criminal justice, specifically on firearms control and police
         training procedures. There are a number of addresses on
         judicial reorganization. 
         <lb/><lb/>A few speeches, 1938-1948, regarding the war effort and
         public service, round out this group. The collection includes
         some speech research material, 1914-1953, such as newspaper
         and magazine clippings. Finally, there are a number of
         speeches by other individuals, and quite a few by members of
         the Justice Department on crime suppression, the New Deal, and
         the presidential campaign of 1936. 
         <lb/><lb/>Following Cummings' own arrangement, his speeches are
         divided into two groups which are in chronological order by
         date of delivery. The first group is a "pure" speech file, and
         contains all his speeches for the years 1886-1948, the second
         group has speeches for the years 1926, 1933-1938, 1950, paired
         with related correspondence, usually letters in praise of the
         topic and delivery requesting copies. The research should note
         that the second series is not complete even for its year
         range, but that it does contain many of the corrected drafts
         of the addresses. The material is arranged as follows: (a)
         "Pure" Speech File, arranged chronologically; (b) speech file
         with related correspondence, arranged chronologically; (c)
         speech research material, arranged chronologically; (d)
         speeches by other individuals, arranged alphabetically by last
         name; (e) speeches by members of the Justice Department,
         arranged chronologically; (f) speeches by members of the
         Justice Department re: crime suppression, arranged
         chronologically. 
         <lb/><lb/>2. 
         <emph render="underline">Articles, 1918-1945</emph>: Cummings'
         articles are largely about crime and the penal system, though
         there are a few about the world court and the mission of
         democracy. They are arranged chronologically. There are a
         number of articles about Cummings, 1934-1940, all of which are
         comments upon and evaluations of Cummings as attorney general.
         <lb/><lb/><lb/></p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series V. Literary Papers</emph><lb/><lb/>1. 
         <emph render="underline">Diaries, 1919-1956</emph>: Cummings
         kept a "Personal and Political Diary" from 1919-1946, in which
         he discussed his political and official activities including
         meetings and trips. These diaries offer an insider's view of
         Democratic politics and government, especially during the
         Roosevelt administration. Cummings also discusses personal and
         family matters, and social engagement. From 1947 to 1956,
         Cummings labeled his diaries "personal" only, but these
         contain many political references as well. There is also a
         travel diary and play about a trip to Hawaii, a housekeeping
         diary, and a medical diary. Appointment books for 1926
         (1931-1955) round out this group. The material is arranged in
         the following order: (a) Personal and political diaries,
         travel diary, and housekeeping diary, arranged
         chronologically; (b) appointment books, arranged
         chronologically; (c) medical diary. 
         <lb/><lb/>2. 
         <emph render="underline">Literary Papers, 1750-1953</emph>:
         This group of papers relating to the publication of Cummings'
         books in chronological order. There are book reviews of
         Liberty Under Law and Administration, 1934-1935. For Federal
         Justice, on which Cummings collaborated with Carl McFarland,
         there are many source files with abstracts of legal briefs and
         historical data, ca. 1750-1938, notes, memoranda, drafts,
         correspondence, and book reviews, 1936-1937. There are drafts
         of The Biography of a Department, 1938, and correspondence
         regarding The Selected Letters of Homer S. Cummings,
         1938-1941, edited by Carl Brent Swisher. There is also
         research material for projected books on the Lands Division of
         the Justice Department, 1828-1953, and on military law,
         1804-1839. Cummings may well have worked with McFarland again
         on these last two projects. 
         <lb/><lb/>Two card indexes, listed by subject, contain acts about
         the duties and powers of the attorney general. A card index to
         Cummings' own library completes the literary papers. 
         <lb/><lb/>The twenty-six diaries, 1919-1926, of Homer Stille
         Cummings document a long career of public service and offer an
         insider's perspective on politics and government during years
         of great change in American life. By virtue of his position on
         the Democratic National committee, and as attorney general in
         the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Cummings
         participated in historic events and associated with many other
         powerful people. As his role in the famous court-packing
         struggle indicated, his legal expertise made him a very
         important member of the Roosevelt cabinet. 
         <lb/><lb/>All but the first volume of the diaries pertain to the
         period 1932-1956, and the most substantive are those for the
         years 1932- 1939. Cummings labeled the diaries and "Personal
         and Political," though there is very little personal material
         before 1939. He recorded his daily activities - meetings,
         conferences, official duties, speeches, telephone
         conversations, and social events - and occasionally wrote in a
         contemplative or analytical vein. The entries range from the
         schematic to the highly detailed. Extremely loyal to both
         Woodrow Wilson and Roosevelt, he described meetings with them
         very thoroughly, sometimes quoting them verbatim. Reflecting
         Cummigns' unique personality and strong sense of public
         service, these diaries are a valuable source for the study of
         an important but neglected figure. Researchers interested in
         Franklin D. Roosevelt, the New Deal, and the Democratic party
         would find them very useful. 
         <lb/><lb/>The earliest dated diary (1919 April-1928 November)
         principally describes Cummings' travels around the country on
         behalf of the Democratic National Committee prior to the
         election of 192. There are no entries for the period 1921
         April through 1923, very few for 1924 October-November, none
         for 1925-192, and a few for 1928 October- November. Some
         sections of the diary are written in the third person,
         probably by Cummings' secretary, Charles F. McGuire. The
         entries are, in the main, brief and factual in nature,
         recording Cummings' itinerary, speeches, meetings, and related
         organizational matters; there is very little analysis.
         Cummings did write at length about several interviews with
         Wilson, in which the two men discussed party politics, the
         Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, the campaign
         and the election of 1920. At two points in the diary, Cummings
         refers to other memoranda, which have been pulled from the
         body of his papers and inserted in the appropriate places. 
         <lb/><lb/>The diaries for the years 1932-1938 are much more
         substantial than the first volume. Except for the second
         volume (1932 January-1933 April 7) the volumes cover a
         calendar year, and include, at the end, the attorney general's
         calendar of daily appointments. The diaries document Cummings'
         active involvement in Roosevelt's campaign for the presidency
         in 1932; Cummings conferred extensively with Democratic
         leaders including David Fitzgerald, Edwin M. House, Louis
         Howe, and Roosevelt about the political situation in various
         states, strategy, and the Democratic National convention. He
         devoted many pages to the process of selecting Roosevelt's
         cabinet, and described the transition between administrations.
         <lb/><lb/>From the time he became attorney general, Cummings wrote
         extensively about his duties at the Justice Department,
         conferences with colleagues and associates, legislation, legal
         cases, appointments, testimony before Congressional
         committees, speeches, and trips. Specific areas of emphasis in
         the diaries included the judicial reorganization, or
         court-packing, plan, the gold bills, crime bills, tax cases,
         the N.R.A., and other "alphabet agencies." Cummings carefully
         recorded the business transacted at Cabinet, Executive
         Council, and National Emergency Council meetings, which rant
         he whole gamut of New Deal concerns: unemployment, relief
         efforts, labor and agricultural unrest, fiscal policy,
         business trends, visits of foreign leaders, and international
         affairs. Cummings described the views and behavior of
         individuals present, especially the present, and expressed his
         own opinions. Possessed of a ready wit, Cummings often wrote
         about the jokes and humorous incidents that lightened
         potentially grim Cabinet meetings. He devoted many pages of
         the diaries to Roosevelt, describing their meetings, telephone
         conversations, and social occasions in the White House. They
         discussed politics, Justice Department matters, appointments,
         domestic affairs, and especially the Supreme Court
         controversy. Except for Roosevelt, Cummings did not stress
         other individuals in the diary to any great extent, though
         there are references to other persons, including Harold Ickes,
         Cordell Hull, Henry Wallace, Raymond Moley, and Henry
         Morgenthau. 
         <lb/><lb/>Besides administrative matters, Cummings also discussed
         strictly political subjects such as patronage, the Democratic
         National Convention of 1936, and the campaign of that year.
         The diaries indicate that he continued to be involved in
         Connecticut politics. By nature a very sociable man, he wrote
         about the numerous dinners, receptions, and cocktail parties,
         that he attended in an official and personal capacity, trips
         at home and abroad, and his annual golf tournaments at
         Pinehurst, North Carolina. Cummings also wrote a little about
         his wife Cecilia and son Dickinson S. Cummings. 
         <lb/><lb/>Following his retirement the cabinet in January 1939,
         Cummings devoted himself to his law practice and personal
         affairs. But he remained an interested observer of politics
         and government, describing various Democratic National
         Conventions, candidates, and elections. He was still
         especially interested in Connecticut politics, and wrote at
         length about the career of his friend Senator Brien McMahon.
         Cummings met, advised, and socialized with many of his former
         colleagues. The diaries also document his association with
         diplomats from the Dominican Republic, and a memorandum
         describing Cummings' visit to that country in 1946 has been
         inserted in the appropriate place. In addition to recording
         his activities in a schematic fashion, Cummings occasionally
         reminisced about past experiences. The diary for 1944 in
         particular contains several references to events in the years
         1832-1937.

         and Legal Case Files, ca. 1915-1933 (1928-1956)</emph><lb/><lb/>This group consists of a few legal papers, mainly
         correspondence and documents, and many legal case files. They
         fall into two groups, the Cummings and Lockwood material,
         1909-1934, and the Cummings and Stanley (later Cummings,
         Stanley, Truitt, and Cross) material, 1939-1953. Most of the
         correspondence is between the partners and relates to various
         cases and financial matters. The papers are grouped by subject
         and then arranged chronologically; the legal case files are
         arranged chronologically.

      <p><emph render="bold">Series VII. Miscellaneous Papers,
         1892-1953</emph><lb/><lb/>There are a few miscellaneous papers, arranged as
         follows: (1) List of autographs of Cummings given out
         1933-1939; (2) correspondence and papers regarding
         biographical information about Cummings, 1933-1953, arranged
         chronologically; (3) certificates, 1911-1956, arranged
         chronologically; (4) U.S. dollar bills and German bank notes;
         (5) programs, 1892-1950, arranged chronologically with bound
         volumes placed behind the folders; (6) souvenirs and
         mementoes, ca. 1922-1949; (7) first issue stamps, with related
         correspondence, 1934-1938.

      <p><emph render="bold">Series VIII. Photographs, 1870-1953,
         Daguerreotypes and Ambrotypes, ca. 1850-1870</emph><lb/><lb/>Many excellent photographs, of a personal and
         professional nature, are found in this collection. Of the
         approximately three thousand items, most date from the period
         of Cummings' active involvement in national political life,
         1919-1939. The professional group of photographs contains
         portraits of Cummings himself, numerous autographed
         professional portraits of such persons as Edwin Alderman, Hugo
         Black, J. Edgar Hoover, Harry Hopkins, Charles Evan Hughes,
         Robert M. LaFollette, Jr., Eleanor Roosevelt, Franklin D.
         Roosevelt, George Bernard Shaw, Alfred Smith, Adlai Stevenson,
         Harry Truman, Gene Tunney, and Woodrow Wilson. There are many
         group pictures of Cummings at work with colleagues and with
         friends, 1919- 1953; and several formal portraits including
         the 1904 meeting of the Mayor's Association of Connecticut,
         and the 1912 Democratic National Executive Committee, and the
         U.S. Supreme Court in 1933. The group pictures of Cummings
         with his colleagues taken prior to 1933 consist largely of his
         activities at the Democratic National Conventions of 1920 and
         1924. The 1933-1939 portion of the professional photographs
         show Cummings in a wide variety of activities in his capacity
         as attorney general, including: participation in national
         conferences and conventions, such as the 1936 Democratic
         National Convention; visits to prison facilities; and
         delivering speeches at occasions such as the 1936 Illinois
         State Fair and the graduation of the Ninth Session of the
         F.B.I. National Police Academy in 1938. There are several
         portraits of Roosevelt's cabinet. The 1940-1953 group of
         pictures includes shots from Pinehurst, North Carolina, golf
         tournaments, the 1944 and 1948 Democratic National Convention,
         and Cummings' visits with Dominican Republic President Raphael
         Trujillo and other Latin American diplomats in the late 1940s.
         <lb/><lb/>The personal photographs in the collection relate to the
         following subjects: parents and ancestors, including Cummings'
         mother, father grandmother, cousins, aunt, and uncle; Cummings
         as a child, dating from the late 1870s; his early
         acquaintances, including persons of the Buffalo Unitarian
         Church and Sunday school; friends and professors at Yale
         University; interior and exterior views of buildings,
         including the Chicago house where Cummings was born in 1870,
         his parents' estates at Ruthven, Akron, New York, and
         Cummings' own home in Stamford, Connecticut. Following the
         early family photographs are portraits of Cummings' wives,
         Helen Smith Cummings, May Cecilia Waterbury Cummings, and
         Julia M. Alter Cummings, and then a large number of
         photographs and postcards from the vacations which Cummings
         took from 1926 to 1945. Among the places he visited were
         Hawaii, Europe, Latin America, and the Mideast. 
         <lb/><lb/>A final miscellaneous group of photographs includes
         undated photographs of architectural monuments, paintings, art
         work, scenes from South America, Great Britain, Pinehurst,
         North Carolina and elsewhere in the United States, and a large
         number of photographic negatives. Several photograph albums
         relate to Cummings' family, acquaintances, and buildings of
         his youth, his 1934 trip to Hawaii and the Rocky Mountains,
         his 1938 trip to Minoqua, Wisconsin, and drawings and
         photographs of prison facilities built in 1938 while Cummings
         was attorney general. 
         <lb/><lb/>The photographs are divided into three parts. The first
         portion of the collection, comprising photographs from
         Cummings' professional life, contains, first, autographed
         professional portraits of Cummings' acquaintances,
         alphabetically arranged, second, professional portraits of
         Cummings, followed, third, by group pictures of Cummings and
         his colleagues, arranged chronologically. 
         <lb/><lb/>The second portion of the collection, the personal
         photographs, is also chronologically arranged. These
         photographs are grouped in the following order: primarily late
         nineteenth century family photographs; photographs of family
         residences, 1870-1935; portraits of Cummings' wives; a
         chronologically arranged series of folders relating to
         Cummings' travels abroad and his leisure activities
         (especially from the period of his marriage to Julia
         Cummings); and miscellaneous undated photographs. 
         <lb/><lb/>The final portion of the collection contains
         photographic negatives, followed in turn by artistic
         reproductions, original drawings and poems, and photograph
         albums. 
         <lb/><lb/>A few ambrotypes and daguerreotypes round out the
         collections. The subjects include Cummings' parents Uriah and
         Audie Cummings, his maternal grandparents, great-uncle, and
         other relatives.
