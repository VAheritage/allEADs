      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of electrostatic copies of the
         correspondence and legal papers, 1716(1751-1862), ca. 88
         items, of William Douglass (1708-1798), his daughter, Margaret
         Douglass Meriwether Terrell, and her son, Charles Meriwether,
         and their extended family.</p>
      <p>The Papers of William Douglass contain correspondence and
         papers directly related to Douglass. Letters, 1787-1791, from
         Douglass to his daughter "Peggie" are chiefly concerned with
         the Goochland parish judgment against him for payment for
         repairs to the Goochland Glebe, with a May 18, 1791 letter
         that refers to her claim to the house and its furnishings.
         There is a letter, October 21, 1753, from James Hunter [in
         Scotland?] to his sister, Nicholas Hunter (Mrs. William)
         Douglass, noting the similarity of engaging apprentices with
         the intention of having work done without wages to having it
         done by Negroes in America. There are several miscellaneous
         letters, 1762-1797, to William Douglass: James Ingram,
         Glasgow, Scotland, discussing the story of reconciliation
         between the Duke of Douglass and the Duchess, meeting them,
         and their characteristics (January 5, 1761); Anne Milroy and
         Susanna Heron (Douglass' sisters), Stewarton, concerning their
         brother Samuel's death and the circumstances (January 9,
         1786); Alexander McCaul, Glasgow, Scotland, mentioning changes
         brought about in America by the revolution (March 16, 1789);
         Patrick Laurie, [Galloway, Scotland], to his uncle, giving
         family news and mentioning the state of the country following
         the emancipation of the British colonies (February 26, 1791);
         and, Robert Baillie, near Alexandria, Virginia, concerning his
         journey and having been in the hire of [Thomas] Jefferson
         until he was chosen Vice- President (December 10, 1797).
         Letters, 1790-1795, from Charles Cosby contain personal and
         religious news. Letters, April 17 and July 23, 1793, from
         James Heron, Richmond, Virginia, to his uncle, refer to the
         expectation that Europe will make war on the French, the
         unfortunate people from Cape Francois arriving at the Capes
         and along the coast, the armed fleet being in Hampton, and
         merchant ships being at Norfolk and Baltimore. Letters,
         1789-1792, from Douglass' grandson, Charles Meriwether,
         Edinburgh, Scotland, give news of attending medical classes
         (April 4, 1791), spending the summer with the Laurie family
         and visiting friends and relatives (August 27, 1791), debating
         whether to continue to live in Scotland or return to America
         and mentioning the French establishing a republic and deposing
         the King (October 13, 1792). Letters, 1774-1789, from Thomas
         Smith, Shancastle and Dumfries, Scotland, concern financial
         and estate matters and news of family and friends. Among the
         legal papers, 1716-1785, are the will, 1716, of [Janet]
         Douglass; appointment of wife and others as trustees to take
         care of Douglass' estate in his absence (1761); the will,
         March 11, 1775, of William Douglass; and, a deed, August 4,
         1791, to Douglass' grandchildren for his library after his
         death. There are also legal papers, 1773-1787, concerning the
         Goochland parish judgment against him for payment for repairs
         done to the Glebe.</p>
      <p>The Papers of the Lewis, Meriwether, Terrell, and related
         families contain correspondence and papers of Margaret
         Douglass Meriwether Terrell and her family. Correspondents
         include Nicholas Lewis, Thomas Walker Lewis, Charles
         Meriwether, and Francis Meriwether (1785-1794); and Charles
         Lewis, Nicholas Lewis, Nicholas Hunter Lewis, Robert Warner
         Lewis, Charles Meriwether, and Edmund Ruffin (1801-1862). On
         April 6, 1790, Charles Meriwether, Edinburgh, Scotland, writes
         to his mother about his travels to Galloway and his stay with
         the Laurie family. Meriwether also writes to his brother
         William about farming and fertilizing methods (April 20, 1790)
         and his marriage to Lydia Laurie and their life together
         (March 7, 1792). Letters, 1803-1805, from Robert W. Lewis in
         Jefferson County, Kentucky, concern life there and the Negroes
         as being pleased with their situation. A letter, December 26,
         1832, from David Anderson to Nicholas Hunter Lewis, concerns
         the purchase of Negroes. On March 15, 1835, Edmund Ruffin
         (1794-1865) writes to Samuel Overton Minor concerning the
         Farmers Register and payment. There is also a note, November
         18, 1862, from Robert E. Lee to Major Duffy about having a
         shoe put on his horse. Legal papers, 1789-1817, include a
         power of attorney from Chiles Terrell and Margaret Douglass
         Terrell to Charles Meriwether (September 14, 1789); statement
         of a dispute between Francis Gilmer and Doctor Charles
         E[verit] (1805); and a petition, n.d., about the deaf and dumb
         asylum in Charlottesville. The one original document, July 4,
         n.y., is entitled "Song, composed for the 4th of July and Sung
         at the Barbacue [sic] held by the Gentlemen of Charlottesville
         in Honour of the Anniversary of American Independance [sic]"
         by [MacAfee?].</p>
