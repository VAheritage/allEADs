      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>There are ca. 835 items, 1800-1945, pertaining chiefly to
         Louis D. Jones of New Store, Buckingham County, and also to
         the Jones and LeGrand families of Buckingham, Prince Edward
         and Halifax counties, Virginia. Persons represented include
         William D. Jones and his sons, Louis D. Jones and Charles W.
         Jones. Contained are correspondence, accounts, promissory
         notes, receipts, legal documents, and genealogical
         material.</p>
      <p>Correspondence of the Jones and related families,
         1836-1901, concern various topics, including personal and
         family news, local news, education, estate matters, and
         business matters. Letters, 1836 and 1837, to Mary Leanna Jones
         provide some information about female education. An
         interesting letter, September 4, 1837, from George B. Peters,
         New Castle, Hardeman County [Texas], covers a wide variety of
         subjects. In his letter, Peters discusses his illness of
         "autumnal bilious fever"; the great current of emigration to
         Texas; people in all vocations going into the land business,
         expecting the government to grant a certain amount of land;
         anticipation of fighting with Mexico; the treaty of alliance
         between Texas and the Comanche Indians; trouble with parties
         of robbing Indians; land for sale in the Chickasaw nation;
         thoughts of moving to Arkansas; making obstetrics his chief
         study; a complicated birth; and young women using snuff. Two
         letters discuss social matters, including the antics of the
         "school girls" (November 17, 1855) and the activities of a
         fair, including art and food specialties (ca. 1850s). There
         are letters and papers pertaining to the estate of Monroe W.
         Jones (November 4, 1859; January 12 and April 19, 1860) and to
         the estate of Sally C. LeGrand (January 12, 1860; July 28,
         1868). There are two letters, December 24, 1860 and January
         30, 1861, from R. A. Lancaster, Richmond, concerning financial
         notes of Charles W. Jones on which his father, William D.
         Jones, is security and drawer. The hire of three
         African-Americans and their subsequent arrest for stealing and
         being placed in Grady's jail for safekeeping is mentioned in
         the former letter. General Orders #77, Quartermaster General's
         Office, Washington, D. C., dated December 15, 1865, from
         M[ontgomery] C[unningham] Meigs (1816-1892), concerns the
         recovery of public animals which had been branded by the
         United States. A letter dated February 4, 1867, from "Cora,"
         Southern Female Institute, Richmond, relates that the
         correspondent is fond of school and Mr. [D. Lee] Powell and
         family and that they have ten boarders and about one-hundred
         day scholars; and discusses teachers, students, and others
         associated with the school. There are two official letters,
         December 10 and 11, 1867, pertaining to the suit of Eliza J.
         Ransome and Louis D. Jones and the delivery of a horse to
         Jones. There is a related letter, June 5, 1872, from E[dward]
         D[avis] Townsend (1817-1893), Adjutant General, War
         Department. A February 17, 1869 document concerns the
         reappointment of Louis D. Jones as Justice of the Peace under
         the "Iron Clad" act of Congress; and, a May 29, 1871 document
         concerns his election as supervisor for the township of
         Francisco in Buckingham County. There is an official letter,
         January 26, 1875, concerning Jones holding the positions of
         postmaster and township supervisor simultaneously. On March 2,
         1878, Charles W. Jones, Amherst Court House, writes about
         being busy with his school by day, being pleased with the
         progress of the students being taught, and that the term of
         his school has expired. He also discusses local politics,
         particularly the Barbour Bill and [Virginia] state debt
         controversy and public debts. A letter of May 4, 1878 details
         a contract for tanning leather to be used in a case between
         Louis D. Jones and Edward Evans. A January 1887 letter from H.
         W. Moss details the financial state of his mother, Phebe Moss
         prior to her death. On November 24, 1890, Kate Dibrell Walker,
         Henderson, North Carolina, writes concerning the death of
         Fousos Dibrell by consumption, family news, life in Henderson,
         and keeping one woman servant and one man who also works at
         the factory. A letter of November 24, 1892, from Louis D.
         Jones, Jr., New Haven, Franklin County, Missouri, discusses
         personal and work life in Missouri and mentions the tilling of
         fruit trees being a rough business; New Haven and its
         situation on the Missouri River; cattle and hogs being shipped
         out and wheat being shipped in; and the large mill; and,
         includes a hand-drawn map of New Haven and nearby railroad
         towns. There are two letters, October 25 and November 1, 1899,
         from Ethelyn [Jones], McGaheysville, to Mary (Jones) Forbes,
         about her plans to get married, dissatisfaction with teaching,
         and lack of family support.</p>
      <p>Correspondence, 1909-1966, of Maben S. Jones pertains to
         personal, business and genealogical matters. A December 27,
         1944 letter comments on the engineering education of Cleveland
         [ ] Jr. at Pennsylvania State College and that he has
         African-American boys in his classes. A letter of January 2,
         1945 mentions teaching in Charlottesville and the arrival in
         July of a new superintendent. There are business letters, July
         1945 to August 1946, between Jones, The Letter Shop, Columbia,
         South Carolina, and B. P. Davies, Jr., The Barnwell
         People-Sentinel, Barnwell, South Carolina. A letter of August
         18, 1946 from Dunn, North Carolina, mentions the Stamp
         Defiance [Chapter of the National Society, Daughters of the
         American Revolution, Wilmington]; news of family in Hartsfield
         House near Wake Forest; "John" coming home from war and being
         inspector of drug stores in the eastern part of North Carolina
         for the State Board of Pharmacy. On November 25, 1966, Miriam
         McFarland Callahan writes concerning the LeGrand estate and
         Keswick estate, claiming that she would like to preserve and
         restore Keswick.</p>
