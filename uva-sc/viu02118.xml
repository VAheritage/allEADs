      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The Forty-sixth Pennsylvania was organized at Harrisburg on
         October 31, 1861. Members of Company K appear to have enlisted
         mainly at Shamokin and other Pennsylvania areas (New Brighton,
         Allegheny, Greensburg, Pittsburg), and Decherd, Tennessee.
         During the period covered by the entries in this volume,
         November 1861 to December 1863, the company was stationed at
         Virginia locales including Winchester and the Shenandoah
         Valley. The company took part in various battles, campaigns,
         and skirmishes at Gordonsville, Warrenton, Culpeper, Cedar
         Mountain, Chancellorsville and elsewhere. It also fought at
         Antietam and Gettysburg before it finally departed from
         Virginia for Alabama on November 5, 1863.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection is comprised of nine items in two groups of
         unrelated materials. The first is a clothing allowance book
         for Company K, Forty-sixth Pennsylvania Infantry, First
         Division, II from 1862 to 1863. The second consists of eight
         letters of Baltimore resident John F. Moore, 1861 &amp;
         1864-1867.</p>
      <p>Most of the approximately 360 men listed in the volume held
         the rank of private followed by that of corporal and sergeant;
         generally, these soldiers were able to sign their own names
         for their accounts. The signatures were witnessed by
         Lieutenant W. P. Caldwell or Captain (later Major) Cyrus
         Strouse. Additional information on the regiment may be found
         in Frederick H. Dyer's

      <p>John F. Moore's letters are addressed to his parents, Dr.
         and Mrs. T. M. Moore of Aberdeen, Ohio. On February 23, 1864,
         Moore writes an extended communique from Washington's National
         Hotel to describe his visit to the city. In his opinion the
         city was crowed with people, conveyances, and military
         officers. He joined "thousands of visitors" at the Capitol
         where he met his "Uncle Ben" and Kentucky Congressman William
         Henry Wadsworth (1821-1893) and Robert Mallory (1815-1885);
         his uncle also introduced him to Ohio Representative Samuel
         Sullivan Cox (1824-1889). According to Moore there was a
         long-running disagreement involving Wadsworth and Mallory
         aligned against Congressman and former general Green Clay
         Smith (1826-1895). He called on Smith and his wife at the
         Washington House but found him sick in bed yet well enough to
         express his dislike of Mallory.</p>
      <p>Moore seems to have had difficulty in deciding upon a
         career, and these letters indicate his family's and his own
         dissatisfaction with his vocation (June 18 &amp; 22, 1864;
         March 1, 1865 and March 16, 1867) as a clerk in the commission
         firm of Mitchell Oliver and Company. He urges his father to
         speculate in gold futures (June 22, 1864) and mentions
         relatives' plans to visit the 1864 Democratic National
         Convention in Chicago (July 24, 1864). [The convention was
         held August 29-31 and nominated General George McClellan for
         President.] Also present is an undated letter from "John"
         (John F. Moore?) with the heading "In Camp at Maysville
         (Kentucky?)" which implies that he had enlisted for military
         duty at some point during the Civil War.</p>
