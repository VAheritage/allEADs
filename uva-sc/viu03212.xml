      <p>John Henry Powell was a world-renowned pianist and composer who was born in Richmond, Virginia on September 6, 1882. He was reported to be singing alto parts as a baby and writing compositions at age four. He studied music under F. C. Hahr and after graduating from the University of Virginia in 1901, he went to Berlin to study under Theodor Leschetizky. His professional debut as a pianist was in Vienna in 1906 and he spent the next eight years performing in Europe. His first American tour was in 1916. He also performed on a European tour with Walter Damrosch and the New York Symphony Orchestra, playing his own composition, <title render="doublequote" >Rhapsodie Negre</title> in 1920. He spent fifteen years composing his magnum opus, <title render="doublequote" >Symphony in A</title> which was successfully performed in 1947.  He went on a European and British tour that was supported by the United States government in an effort to improve relations with Great Britain. He was managed by the National Broadcasting Artist’s Service in New York. He taught music at Denver College and was president of the Virginia Music Federation. He was an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa, Societe Astronomique De France, and the American Institute of Arts and Letters.  In 1928 he married Louise Burleigh (1890-1961), a playwright and artist in her own right. 
      </p>
      <p>Some of Powell’s musical works include <title render="doublequote" >Sonata Virginianesque</title>, <title render="doublequote" >Sonata A Flat</title>, <title render="doublequote" >Sonate Noble</title>, <title render="doublequote" >Rhapsodie Negre</title>, <title render="doublequote" >Natchez-On-the Hill</title>, <title render="doublequote" >Variations and Double-Fuge</title>, and <title render="doublequote" >Overture: In Old Virginia</title>. His folksongs include <title render="doublequote" >At the Fair</title>, <title render="doublequote" >Hoochee-Coochee Dance</title>, <title render="doublequote" >Circassian Beauty</title>, <title render="doublequote" >Merry-go-round</title>, <title render="doublequote" >Clowns</title>, <title render="doublequote" >Snake-Charmer</title>, <title render="doublequote" >Banjo-Picker</title>, <title render="doublequote" >In the Hammock</title>, <title render="doublequote" >Dirge</title>, <title render="doublequote" >From a Loved Past</title>, and <title render="doublequote" >In the South.</title>
      </p>
      <p>Powell was passionate about the preservation of folk music that he considered to be “Anglo Saxon.” He uncovered folk songs and ballads and played them in concerts so that more people could enjoy the music and its history. 
      </p>
      <p>Powell is also well known for his work in eugenics which began in the early 1920s. He supported racial integrity legislation that passed the General Assembly of Virginia in 1926. He proposed amendments to the legislation and encouraged other states to follow Virginia’s laws as a model to prevent “mongolization” of the white race. He worked closely with Earnest Sevier Cox, Madison Grant, Dr. Walter Ashby Plecker, Lothrop Stoddard, H. Norton Mason, Marcus Garvey, and promoted the Anglo-Saxon Clubs of America in an effort to preserve the white race in America. He also edited the writings of his colleagues and had a close relationship with The Richmond-Times Dispatch. He was considered by many to be “the founding father of racial integrity legislation” in Virginia. 
      </p>
      <p>John Powell died in Richmond, Virginia in 1963.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>  
The papers consist chiefly of the correspondence of John Powell, a world-renowned pianist and composer who lived in Richmond and Charlottesville, Virginia from his birth in 1882 until his 
death in 1963. The collection consists of ca.15,025 items, 45 Hollinger boxes, and 225 linear feet. The correspondence includes letters to John and his wife, Louise Burleigh Powell from 
1908 to 1963. There are personal letters to friends in the United States, Germany, Austria, England, and France as well as professional correspondence with music agents and composers in 
the United States and England. Some of the correspondents are 
Gamaliel Bradford, Leander January de Bekker, Annabel Morris Buchanan, Harry Flood Byrd, Jr., James Branch Cabell; Joseph Conrad, Francis Warrington Dawson, Lord Dunsany, Mary Johnston, 
Daniel Gregory Mason, John Lloyd Newcomb; Walter Ashby Plecker, Katherine (Kitty) Buckley Powell, Amelie Rives, Eleanor Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Edward Reilly Stettinius, Jr., Claude Augustus Swanson, and Winston 
Wilkinson. 
</p>
      <p>
Most of the correspondence relates to the provisions needed to give concerts and negotiations between commercial music agents and music clubs. Correspondence also focuses on the 
discovery of folk songs, requests for Powell to act as a judge in musical contests and Powell's work with many Universities to increase the understanding of folk music. There is also 
information about Powell's efforts to set up a Music Department at the University of Virginia and a Silver Jubilee concert at Carnegie Hall where the proceeds of Powell's concert are 
to be donated to the University of Virginia Library for the purchase of letters by Thomas Jefferson and [Joseph] Cabell. There is also a set of stamps from the Charlottesville Apple 
Festival included in the correspondence from 1953. (Box 18, folder 7)
</p>
      <p>
In addition to correspondence, there are manuscripts relating to John Powell, including articles, and course materials on the history of folk music. He promoted courses on folk music 
and gave performances to local music clubs all over the country in an attempt to educate the public about this type of music. There are also piano works, such 
as <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Dirge,</title> a piano duet by Powell, op. 26, notes about programs, 
        musical scores, reviews of musical compositions, and speeches. 
</p>
      <p>
Included in the manuscripts of this collection is a civil war account that was given to John Powell titled, 
        <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Recollections of a Courier of the Last Ten Days of the Army.</title> It 
        is a first hand account of life on the battlefield in the Civil War and is published in the 
        <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Confederate Veteran</title>, vol. 27 (1919), page 341. 
</p>
      <p>
Other manuscripts include original drafts of plays by Louise Burleigh Powell and musical and drama manuscripts by colleagues of John and Louise Powell. 
The manuscripts are arranged alphabetically by type of material. Following the manuscripts in this collection, is printed material for musical programs.
</p>
      <p>
The Powell collection also has significant correspondence on eugenics and racial integrity. Powell's dedication to folk music was equaled by his passionate interest in maintaining 
the purity of the Anglo-Saxon race in America. He was very active in establishing Anglo-Saxon Clubs of America and promoting legislation that would keep the races separate. There are 
articles about eugenics and many letters written to John Powell about racial integrity, including vivid descriptions by his wife, Louise Burleigh Powell, of the racial laws being 
argued in the courtroom. Powell also collaborated with Marcus Garvey in a movement that tried to colonize African Americans.
</p>
      <p>
Dr. Walter Ashby Plecker, the State Registrar of the Bureau of Vital Statistics in Virginia, shared Powell's passion for racial integrity, and sent copies of all his correspondence 
concerning racial matters to Powell. Dr. Plecker believed that the Indians had mixed with African Americans and there were no longer any pure Indians in Virginia. He wrote on the 
back of their birth certificates that they were not Indian. Plecker dedicated his life to preventing African Americans from trying to pass as Indian or White and there are many 
copies of his letters in the collection. 
</p>
      <p>
In addition to the correspondence of John Powell and Dr. Walter Ashby Plecker, there are news clippings 
from <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Richmond Times-Dispatch</title>, 
        <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Richmond News Leader</title>, 
        <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Daily Progress</title> and several other 
        newspapers about racial integrity and John Powell.

              <p>To the General Assembly of Virginia. White residents issue a petition complaining that there are free mulattoes living on the land that was given to the Indian ancestors of the mulattoes. The petitioners write that the negroes could bring evil and they describe it as , "...the ready asylum of runaway slaves, and a secure harbor for every one who wishes concealment."

Powell writes that the law since 1910 states that a colored person is defined by a certain fraction of African blood. The Virginia Racial Integrity Act of 1924 defines a white person as having no trace of any blood other than Caucasian or having less than 1/16 of Indian blood.

              <p>James makes negative comments about Plecker's work in racial integrity in a conversation with Powell and again later in a meeting with Powell's colleagues. James says that he would like "to see the leading lawyer, the leading physician, and the leading minister of the Gospel of Richmond, negroes; and that any time the best citizens of Richmond could be seen at Atlantic City dancing in cabarets with negresses." Powell forms a committee to review James' statements and James threatens to sue Powell for slander. Powell responds by making threats to James' position on the Board of Public Welfare. Under pressure James denies his comments, and Powell collects statements from his colleagues to prove that James did make the comments. Powell writes that a public service official with such views is "a very real menace to the public." There is also a handwritten first draft of this letter.

He writes, "Anglo-Saxon Clubs of America is a non-secret, non-fraternal and non-sectarian organization; it has no connection whatever with the Ku Klux Klan nor with the White America Society." He also writes that its purpose is to preserve both the white and black race and prevent miscegenation. He claims that the clubs help to pass racial integrity legislation and has not been harmful to the Negroes. He also writes about his association with Marcus Garvey.

              <p>Powell threatens opponents of the Massenburg bill which requires all segregated seating at public assemblies. Powell writes, "In all seriousness, I warn you that the defeat of this bill may bring tragedy and horror upon the oldest English-speaking community in America." He adds that others support this view, such as Judge Spratley, who pleaded for it with "a broken voice and tearful eyes." He warns that he "does not envy the opponents of this bill the responsibility they are unnecessarily and gratuitously assuming." He also writes that this letter "was inspired by a sincere desire to spare you bitter regret."

              <p>Powell thanks the newspaper for their appreciative comment during a time of criticism on his racial legislation before the Virginia General Assembly. Powell claims that Negroes were registering as Indians creating a "path from black to white." He explains that the pattern went from "Indianoid negro to Negroid Indian, Negroid Indian to plain Indian, plain Indian to Indianoid white, whose marriage to a white person established his position in the white class."

              <p>Opinion by Justice H. B. Gregory. Bascom and Reda Keith had been sentenced to the penitentiary because they were married and Bascom was accused of having traces of colored blood. This opinion reverses the decision because there is no evidence. The opinion explains that the burden of proof is on the Commonwealth.

              <p>Gross writes in response to S.1880 introduced by Senator Langer proposing aid to persons wanting to move to Liberia. He writes that the bill conflicts with the immigration policy of the Liberian government which limits the number of immigrants depending on their level of skills and training. He also writes that the United States has supplemented Liberia with resources but much more help is needed before they would be ready to accept large numbers of immigrants.

              <p>Crawford writes about being discouraged but will fight back, even by trying to elect a new Governor. He writes, "Southern white citizens have given them six of the most frustrated years since the organization of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People." He also writes, "Help stop the Communists drive in our communities..." and he mentions a film that shows the student riots in San Francisco and urges members to show it in their area.

He claims that the media gives Liberia a negative and untrue representation. He also writes that Apartheid will be solved over time through separatism. He mentions that President Tubman of Liberia is on good terms with the United States and Powell should ask Tubman to invite American "negroes" to move there and enjoy new business opportunities with a young economy.

              <p> Louise Powell updates her husband on the legislation as it goes through the Senate and fails to pass. She describes the courtroom, the senators and their antics in vivid detail. While the legislation is being introduced, Senator Haddon presents an amendment to change the definition of negro to 1/32 of African blood. Haddon defends against an accusation that he is supporting the Indians because he is related to them. Louise Powell suggests that they mention the definition of a white person in the Racial Integrity Bill of 1926. She attributes the failure of the bill to the emotionalism of Dr. Blackwell and Dr. Ryland.

              <p>Plecker explains that the Racial Integrity Law has an exception for individuals with one-sixteenth or less Indian blood to pass as white which is allowing colored groups to claim they are white. Plecker also describes an unreliable test that some registrars use to determine the racial status of an individual, "If it [a comb] passes through the hair of an applicant he is an Indian, if not he is a negro..." Plecker also offers suggestions on racial integrity legislature for Ohio.

              <p>Plecker complains that the article about an Indian reservation is inaccurate and romanticized, which leads people to believe that it is okay to intermarry with mixed races. He writes that he has studied the records as far back as 1853 and these people are no longer Indian. He writes, "History and the United States Bureau of Ethnology speak in no uncertain tones. That Bureau in a number of references to the Pamunkeys, Chickahominies, Mattaponis and Croatons describe them as being mixed with negro and white." He cites Howe's, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">History of Virginia</title> (1845) as his reference. Plecker also writes about the "fish-fries" that white women are attending and wants them to be stopped.

              <p>Plecker responds to her inquiry about the use of a blood test to determine the racial status of an individual. He explains that there is no reliable test for such determination. He also writes that such a test would not be helpful because often the cases that need studying involve mixed black and white. Some effort has been made to determine the race by the hair. He writes that the most reliable method is by tracing family names and their records from the Census. He offers to find information for her, if she will supply the names of the parents and grandparents.

              <p>Plecker received Perry's letter about a book on racial intermixture and writes to him, "There are quite a number of freaks of this sort who write books of that kind. They do not know it but they get their ideas from Communistic sources, frequently from foreign college professors. Every farmer boy knows that you cannot mix various types and breeds of stock and get anything but poor results. The same applies equally to human beings." He ends by saying that he hopes Georgia will follow Virginia on the race question and prevent racial intermarriage.

Hampton is opposed to the white mans "back door courtship" that has flooded the streets of Virginia, with mulatto children, born out of wedlock.

              <p>Frank Darling, a member of the Advisory Board of the Hampton Institute disagrees with Dr. Gregg's statement that <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">there has never been encouragement of social mingling of the races under circumstances which would lead to embarrassment on either side.</title> Darling writes that he has seen the mingling of the races at the Institute. The Anglo-Saxon Club demands that Gregg rectify the conditions and also mentions that the Governor is planning to press charges. Gregg is told that Marcus Garvey and his organization, The Universal Negro Improvement Association, will help alleviate the pressure from other negro newspapers and negro organizations.

              <p>This article sympathizes with Dr. Gregg and describes that most of the country has been closely watching this attack from the Anglo-Saxon Clubs of America on the Hampton Institute. The article quotes Gregg's letter in which he states that the Institute "does not encourage social mingling of the races in a 'romantic' way" and "publicly announces a strict policy on separation."  The Anglo-Saxon Clubs of America are referred to as fanatics and are criticized for not following their "alleged policy of 'fostering better race relations.'"

              <p>An article about the burial of Robert Damell, the sexton of the church for eighteen years who was deeply respected by the white congregation of  St. Paul's. Both of the races came together for the funeral of this man. <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Newport News Daily Press</title> states that this mixed audience is a very different situation than the attendance of a concert and the difference should be obvious and if someone does not understand it, they are not "manor-born."

              <p>An editorial by "Nordic"  responds to the editor by writing that it is appropriate to sit in a mixed audience during a funeral for a colored person because that is a moral and Christian decision. He points out that the bible does not say to keep the races separate. He mentions Dr. J. Wilton Hope, President of the Anglo-Saxon Club of Hampton and asks whether he would want to ask St. Peter to separate him from <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="singlequote" xlink:href="">Negroes</title> in heaven.

              <p>"Nordic" writes in a friendly way to the Southern editor that the internal organization of the Hampton Institute is not the business of outsiders. He also discusses religion; there are no marriages in heaven; (so there is no need to worry about intermarriages). He also writes that not only is the spirit resurrected but so is the body and he adds, "nothing is said about bleaching" [making the bodies white].

Copeland, Powell and Plecker have been reinforced by one Dr. J. Wilton Hope," who recently protested the Glee Club of North Carolina for giving a recital in Ogden Hall, at the Hampton Institute. The editor writes that the concert is performed for the school and whites are welcome but if they don't like the mixed seating, they do not have to come. A reference is also made to the mixed seating at the funeral for the sexton at St. Paul's Church.

The article argues that the only thing that the bill proposed was to "define a colored person as any one having an ascertainable amount of Negro blood." It also states that the only reason it was defeated is because the Senate was vulnerable to the "onslaught made on its emotions and sympathies."

              <p>The author of the editorial complains that the desegregated schools have violence and racial tensions that are causing harm to the children. The author adds that they had                                        warned that this would happen. He writes, "we told you so."

              <p>Rogers comments that the one good thing that has come out of the 1954 Supreme Court decision on school desegregation is that Richmond is considering a revival of private schools. He tells the rich history of private schools in Richmond, going back to the year, 1759. He mentions the Lancaster School, The Academy of Fine Arts and Science of the United States, and the Richmond Academy for Female Education. He also mentions John Peyton McGuire and his school for boys.

Grover C. Hall, Jr., a "colorful," "Southern," and "fearless" editor writes about how the South will not respond well to desegregation. He states, "If Northern politicians, licksplitting and honey-bunching the minority voting blocs in the North, impel the Federal government to grind down upon the South one of two things may happen. Much of the South will close its schools or there will be violence."
