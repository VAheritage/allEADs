            <head>James Booker and John Booker</head>
            <p>The twins, John and James, were born to 
            <persname>John Booker (1797-1859)</persname>and 
            <persname>Nancy Blair Reynolds Booker
            (1796-1859)</persname>on October 10, 1840. Nancy and John
            had been married since November 15, 1824 and had four other
            children besides the twins: Mary Ann Booker Sparks
            (1825-1872), Armistead M. Booker (1827-1838), Caroline
            Booker (1833-1859) and William Booker (1836-1859).</p>
            <p>Nancy also had another child --Margaret Benson Reynolds
            (1815-1867) --from a previous marriage to William Reynolds
            (March 29, 1814) (Austin).</p>
            <p>In the first three months of 1859, typhoid fever struck
            the Booker family, killing Nancy, John Sr., Caroline and
            William. James and John were 19 years old. For the next two
            years, the twins stayed with relatives, including Aunt
            Kitty and Uncle John Blair, who later moved to Texas in
            1860 (James Booker, September 6, 1861).</p>
            <p>At the age of 21, James and John enlisted in the
            Confederate Army, the 38th Regiment of Virginia, on May 24,
            1861 in 
            <geogname>Whitmell, Virginia</geogname>, in 
            <corpname>Company D, 38th Virginia Regiment, Infantry (also
            known as "the Whitmell Guards").</corpname>For more
            information about the regiment see 
            <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
                  <title>38th Virginia Infantry</title>by G. Howard Gregory
            (E 581.5 38th .G73 1988)</bibref>. The Booker brothers
            remained in service throughout the war, and were both
            promoted to Sergeant sometime before April, 1864 (Gregory,
            82).</p>
            <p>In March of 1862, James was hospitalized in Richmond
            with chronic diarrhea, but returned to his company soon
            after. Both brothers were severely wounded at the 
            <geogname>Battle of Drewry's Bluff near Petersburg,
            Virginia</geogname>, on May 16, 1864 and transferred to 
            <corpname>Chimborazo Hospital</corpname>. John received a
            chest wound and James was wounded in the right thigh. Only
            James, however, would survive. John died of his wound on
            August 26, 1864.</p>
            <p>After the war, James returned to Pittsylvania County and
            on October 31, 1867, he married 
            <persname>Martha Ann Fulton (?-1923)</persname>(nicknamed
            "Pat") of 
            <geogname>Pittsylvania County</geogname>, on October 31,
            1867. She was one of the "sweethearts" mentioned in his
            letters. James and Pat Booker had seven children. They died
            within two months of each other in 1923. A typed page
            listing their children and mentioning her relatives can be
            found with the copies of the typescripts of the brothers'
            letters.</p>

         <bioghist>
            <head>Chloe Unity Blair</head>
            <p>Chloe Unity Blair (1833-1875) was born to Chloe Coleman
            Blair (1801-1854) and Drury Blair (1801-1864). Her father
            was Nancy Booker's younger brother, making James and John
            her first cousins. Chloe Unity had several brothers and
            sisters, some of whom James and John mention in their
            letters: Polly Ann, William, and Drury Addison "Addie"
            Blair, who briefly served in the 38th Regiment with the
            Bookers.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, all of Chloe Unity's letters to her
            Booker cousins were either destroyed or are as yet
            undiscovered. From their responses, however, we can see
            that both John and James greatly appreciated her letters.
            They depended upon her for news of the family and they
            often asked her to "remember" them to different family
            members. The Bookers also periodically asked their cousin
            to have their sister Mary forward certain items such as
            clothing or James' "soldier likeness" (October 4, 1863).
            Chloe Unity would send them gifts and provisions as well,
            prompting James to write, "I am under many obligations to
            you all for send ing us such a fine box it was a great
            treat to us," (October 4, 1863). James and John are always
            polite and solicitous in tone to their cousin, and yet the
            letters also convey warmth and friendship: having lost
            their parents and two siblings just before the war, John
            and James may have been especially close to "cousin Unity,"
            who along with their sister Mary may have served as a kind
            of surrogate mother.</p>
            <p>Indeed, when John married Martha Ann Fulton in October
            of 1867, he became Chloe's step-son-in-law, since Chloe had
            married Martha's father William Fulton (1821-18?) just a
            few months before. It is easy to imagine that the two
            cousins were pleased by this relationship, as their
            respective marriages unified and tightened the Booker and
            Blair families which had suffered so many losses during the
            war years.</p>

            <head>The 38th Virginia Infantry: A Brief History of the
            Regiment</head>
            <p>On May 3, 1861, Governor John Letcher called for the men
            of Virginia to leave their families and occupations and
            join the Confederate Army. Soon after, the 38th Virginia
            Volunteer Infantry Regiment was formed, lead by Colonel
            Edward Edmonds, Lieutenant Colonel Powhatan Whittle and
            Major Isaac Carrington. During the course of the war, the
            38th was assigned to several different brigades, including
            Smith's, Early's and Armistead's Brigade. There was also
            considerable turnover of officers, as some were wounded,
            killed, or not re-elected.</p>
            <p>The 38th consisted of ten companies, most of which were
            organized in Pittsylvania County, VA. Company D, which the
            Bookers joined, was organized at Whitmell. Its initial
            leader was Captain Ralph Herndon.</p>

            <head>Overview of Themes Discussed in the Letters</head>
            <p>The letters of James and John Booker give a sense of
            what life was like for an ordinary soldier serving in the
            Confederate army. Of course, the Bookers depict the drama
            of battle --describing gunfire and cannonades, listing the
            dead and wounded, and giving thanks for their own escapes
            from death or imprisonment--but the letters are more
            concerned with the rhythms of everyday life at camp. The
            Bookers worry over their health and their comrades'; enjoy
            the plenty or (more often) lament the lack of food and
            supplies; report on the interactions between civilians and
            soldiers; and describe religious revivals held at the camp.
            As the war goes on, the Bookers begin to articulate with
            more intensity not only what happens to them, but how they
            feel about it. Whereas John fumes against the elites
            (officers, politicians, and the wealthy) for evading their
            responsibilities and mistreating the common soldier, James
            grows more fatalistic and religious, trusting that his
            suffering is God's will.</p>

            <head>Preparing for Battle</head>
            <p>The members of the 38th Virginia spent much of their
            time drilling, marching, serving picket duty, and
            speculating about when and where the next battle would be.
            Indeed, the Bookers seem to devote more energy to
            anticipating battles than to describing them (perhaps
            because they did not want to upset their cousin). They
            acquired much of the information that fueled their
            speculations from gossipping with citizens and other
            soldiers. In a letter from 1861, for instance, James Booker
            predicts that a "hard battle" will break out soon, basing
            his prediction on a conversation he had with a soldier
            whose company is located closer to the front (October 8).
            Sometimes more immediate experiences led the Bookers to
            forecast a battle, especially when they could see Union
            troops or hear cannonades and gunfire nearby. Writing from
            a rain-soaked outpost near Yorktown, Virginia in 1862, for
            instance, James reports that the Union forces have been
            "shooting at our men constantly tho it is very cildom thay
            hit eny of them" (April 19). He predicts that soon a battle
            will occur that will decide the war, since he has heard
            that Yankee prisoners "say that thay have got to whip or
            die here" (April 19, 1862). But in this prediction, as in
            others, James was disappointed. As the war dragged on, the
            Bookers stopped assuming that it would reach a speedy
            conclusion; indeed, by 1864 John came to the conclusion
            that the "leaden men" were not really interested in
            achieving peace (March 1, 1864).</p>
            <p>Although the Bookers participated in several battles and
            skirmishes, the most devastating battle for their regiment
            was Gettysburg (see the section on Regimental History for a
            complete list of the engagements that the 38th took part
            in). While participating in Pickett's Charge, the 38th
            Virginia lost Colonel Edmonds, whom James Booker describes
            as "one of the best men in service," and many other
            officers and soldiers (July 11, 1863). The Booker brothers
            themselves had to scramble to avoid being captured by Union
            troops; several of their companions, however, "let the
            Yankees take them" (John Booker, July 11, 1863).</p>
            <p>Not only were the Bookers shocked by their experiences
            in battle, but by chilling events that upset camp routines.
            In the first weeks of the war, James Booker reports, a
            young man accidentally shot another soldier from his
            hometown and now is "about to grieve himself to death about
            it" (July 14, 1861). But James passes on an even more
            shocking story in a later letter: two soldiers were caught
            conspiring to kill their commanding officer and were
            executed. In an attempt to "save their souls," the
            condemned soldiers "gave the Roman Catholic Priest 25
            dollars apiece" (December 15, 1861).</p>

            <head>Health</head>
            <p>More explainable than violence in the camps, but
            ultimately more destructive, was disease. Illness and
            disease killed two-thirds of the Southern soldiers who died
            during the Civil War, so not surprisingly the Bookers often
            detail the health problems that they and their fellow
            soldiers were suffering (Robertson 88-89). These ailments
            include jaundice, typhoid, stomach disorders, fever, and
            mumps. The Bookers imply that much of the illness is due to
            the conditions the soldiers must face; sometimes the
            soldiers lacked adequate shelter, at times they would have
            to wade rivers and then march miles wearing wet clothing,
            and often they lacked adequate provisions (John Booker,
            April 29, 1862). Although sick soldiers were typically sent
            to the hospital, the men also took care of each other. In
            the fall of 1861, James and John Booker, apparently just
            recovering from sickness themselves, were responsible for
            nursing three members of their company (James Booker,
            September 6). Several months later, James Booker fell sick
            with chronic diarrhea and was sent to Greaner's Hospital in
            Richmond to recuperate. While in the hospital, Booker was
            stuck in a Catch-22: he wanted to get a furlough so that he
            could recover his health at home, but he did not know where
            his company was, so he could not get the permission of his
            commanding officer to return to Pittsylvania. Eventually
            James re-joined his company, but he did not receive the
            furlough that he wished for.</p>

            <head>Food and Supplies</head>
            <p>Although in his first letter James Booker claims that
            the soldiers get "plenty of good pervision," the Bookers
            later complained that they often didn't get enough to eat
            (July 14, 1861). As James writes in 1862, "the rations has
            bin very scanty a large portion of the time sence we have
            bin marching" (September 30). But sometimes the 38th
            Virginia did enjoy plentiful supplies, particularly when
            they camped in locations where food was abundant. When the
            38th Virginia arrived near Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, for
            instance, James Booker reported that "we can get plenty of
            milk &amp; butter and apple butter that is verry good"
            (June 30, 1863). Often civilians would supply soldiers with
            food, whether because they feared or supported the
            troops.</p>

         <scopecontent>
            <head>Interactions with Civilians</head>
            <p>Throughout the letters, the Bookers demonstrate their
            consciousness of the effect the war is having on the
            civilians. At the beginning of the war, James Booker
            describes the friendly exchanges between Southern soldiers
            and civilians, reporting gleefully from a camp near
            Winchester that the men have "a fine chance of beautiful
            young Ladies, and the kindest that I ever saw" (July 14,
            1861). Besides providing moral support, Southern civilians
            would exchange information about the war with the
            Confederate troops (James Booker, November 24, 1862). Both
            Southern and Northern civilians would sell or give supplies
            to Confederate troops. Writing from Winchester, Virginia in
            1862, James Booker even claims that he prefers Yankees to
            Quakers, since "the Yankees will sell us eny thing cheap
            for the specia" while "the quakers will sell any thing thay
            have got when the spirit moves them, tho we cant catch them
            rite half our time" (James Booker, October 17, 1862).
            Likewise, in Fredericksburg, Pennsylvania, the Yankee
            citizens treated the Confederate soldiers "verry kind,"
            providing them food without charging them for it, though
            James suggests that "it is don through fear" (June 30,
            1863). While in Fredericksburg, James enjoyed a mutually
            supportive relationship with a local civilian, guarding his
            home in exchange for lodging.</p>
            <p>Although civilians and soldiers often cooperated with
            each other, the Bookers realized that the war was damaging
            the lives of those not directly involved in the fighting.
            In particular, James argues, citizens who live near the
            "line of the enemy" "have great deal to see trouble about"
            (June 14, 1863). Even those areas not yet scarred by the
            war would soon be, James predicts. As he says of
            Fredericksburg, Pennsylvania,"this is a verry flourishing
            looking Country the crops all look fine. it has never felt
            the affect of the war, though I guess if we stay here long
            it will feel the affect of it" (June 30, 1863). James
            especially blames Northern soldiers for looting the homes
            of Southern citizens, claiming that "the yankees is geting
            too mean to live" (June 14, 1863). But he admits that some
            Confederate soldiers likewise have stolen from citizens,
            disobeying General Lee's orders. Indeed, one woman stormed
            into the Confederate camp near Kinston, North Carolina,
            hoping to recover a skillet of soup that had been stolen
            (June 30, 1863; January 1, 1864). Confederate soldiers also
            stole over 18,000 dollars from the Quarter Master (January
            1, 1864). Despite these incidents, James Booker was
            offended when Confederate General Seth Maxwell Barton
            called the members of his brigade "rags and thieves," since
            "it is not healthy for him to gave honist people such a bad
            name because some men does wrong" (January 1, 1864).</p>

            <head>Morale</head>
            <p>Early in the war, James and John Booker seemed to
            believe that the South would defeat the North swiftly. They
            contended that the South had a stronger army, and they
            noted that Northerners "dont unite like our people do,"
            since the Democrats and the Republicans were at odds (James
            Booker, June 30, 1863).</p>
            <p>Soon their hope had begun to fade. Though James Booker
            longed to return home, by 1863 he no longer believed that
            the North and South would achieve a quick peace: 
            <blockquote>
                  <p>"I am a fread it will be a long time first if ever, I
               think the prosspect for peece is very gloomy now it dont
               look like eather side is make in any prepperration for
               Piece, thare are greater preperation for fighten than
               ever" (September 23, 1863).</p>
               </blockquote>John Booker was even more pessimistic, and
            certainly much more cynical, as he accused the Southern
            leadership of needlessly prolonging the war: 
            <blockquote>
                  <p>"I beleave that we mout have hud piece be fore this
               time if our head leaden men would would have tride"
               (March 1, 1864).</p>
               </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>The Bookers, particularly John, felt that while Southern
            elites were making decisions that extended the war, the
            poor were actually fighting most of the battles and
            suffering the consequences of those decisions. Because the
            First Conscription Act allowed a drafted man to hire a
            "substitute" to serve his term in the army, wealthy men
            could evade service (Current, 396-99). This provision
            enraged many of the Confederate soldiers, who contended
            that it placed the burden of the war on those who could not
            afford to pay for a substitute. Not only did substitution
            fan class tensions, but it also failed to bring competent
            soldiers into the army. James Booker mentions that that the
            substitute for John Millner deserted, and many other
            substitutes did likewise (August 3, 1862). Some men even
            made a business of agreeing to substitute for one person,
            deserting, and then collecting money to substitute for
            someone else. Although James Booker did not get angry about
            the practice of substitution, he understood that it
            weakened the Confederate Army: 
            <blockquote>
                  <p>"I dont blame no man to put in a substitute if he
               can, tho I think if it is kept up much long er it will
               ruin our army" (August 3, 1862).</p>
               </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>His brother John, however, was less tentative in
            condemning substitution: 
            <blockquote>
                  <p>"I say put every one on equal foottin for this is a
               rich mans war an a por mans fight, I be leave thare are
               some of the men that have but in substitute are dooen a
               great [d]eal of good but the most of them are doo en
               more harm than good they are just speculaten on the poor
               people, an soldiers" (December 22, 1863).</p>
               </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>Further feeding John Booker's indignation was the
            distribution of furloughs. According to the First
            Conscription Act, a "twelvemonth man" was entitled to a
            sixty-day furlough each year, but neither Booker received a
            furlough during his time in the army (Current, 396-99).
            John Booker noted that while officers freely took furloughs
            themselves, the captain in charge of his company, John
            Herndon, was "too lazy" to give his exhausted men a break
            (Decemeber 22, 1863).</p>
            <p>As a result of the inequalities and inefficiencies of
            miltary adminstration, John Booker believed that soldiers
            should refuse to re-enlist. In his March 1, 1864 letter, he
            derides the miltary pagaent staged by Virginia Governor
            William "Extra Billy" Smith and Colonel Cabell in an
            attempt to persuade the men to re-enlist. After commanding
            the soldiers to line up, the Colonel ordered that the
            Colors (the flags of the regiment) be borne to the front
            and asked "all who wer determen to be freemen to step out
            on the line with the cullars and all who wer willen to be
            slaves for thare enemyes to stand fast" (March 1, 1864).
            Angry that he hadn't yet received a furlough, and convinced
            that re-enlisting would only encourage the Southern
            leadership to continue the war, John Booker rejected the
            Colonel's challenge that he re-enlist; two-thirds of the
            soldiers stood back with him. As he explains, "I dideant
            inten to reinlist nor I wes not willen to be a Slave for my
            enemyes and I dident go on line with the reinlisted, and I
            dideant wish to bee in eather line" (March 1, 1864).</p>

         <scopecontent>
            <head>Religion</head>
            <p>Whereas John Booker responded to terrible conditions by
            getting angry, his brother James turned to religion as a
            way of making sense of his suffering and connecting with
            home. As he writes of his homesickness, James Booker
            occasionally expresses his desire to join his relatives at
            the religious revivals held at Mount Hermon Baptist Church
            near Danville, Virginia (August 3, 1862). But he reassures
            his cousin that revivals often take place in the camp and
            that many soldiers have been converted. According to James,
            a sense of gratitude in war-time motivates many of the men
            to convert: "I think it is time for them to turn after
            being blesed so plainley as they have bin in the past
            battles" (October 17, 1862). Likewise, James' faith seems
            to have strengthened him and given him hope of returning
            home, whether to Pittsylvania County or to Heaven. In a
            letter written on New Years Day of 1864, James includes two
            quotations about coming home to and through God. Quoting
            from the third stanza of "Amazing Grace," James writes, 
            <blockquote>
                  <p>Tis grace that brought me safe thus far And grace
               will lead me home.</p>
               </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>In March of 1864, however, James believed that he might
            not arrive home safely, at least not home to Pittsylvania,
            since the spring campaign would soon open and "then we poor
            soldiers will see a hard time" (March 16, 1864). But James
            embraced a spirit of Christian fatalism, contending that
            his life was in God's hands: "If it is the will of [my]
            maker for me to be cut down in this war I dont ask to be
            spared for I beleave that he will do what is the best for
            me, thare is but few things that I would ask to stay in
            this trouble some world for" (March 16, 1864). After
            writing this letter, James Booker lived for almost sixty
            more years, but his twin John died five months later of
            wounds he received at Drewry's Bluff.</p>

                  <p>Optimistic at the beginning of the war, James
                  Booker praises the "elegant water," "beautiful young
                  Ladies," and "most beautiful country" he finds at the
                  38th's camp at Winchester. But he notes that one
                  member of the regiment accidentally shot another
                  member from his hometown and now feel terrible. He
                  warns that "cowardly boys" who are avoiding service
                  should beware, since they are likely to be drafted or
                  made to put up breastworks. After salutations and
                  greetings, James indicates where letters should be
                  sent. A. Blair, a relative of James' and possibly
                  Chloe Blair's brother, writes a short note to be
                  included. Blair indicates that he is including a
                  letter that "brother William" received from
                  "brother," who was expecting to go to Manassas. Blair
                  finishes by saying that all are well.</p>

                  <p>James Booker complains of not hearing from his
                  family. He mentions being too ill to serve and that
                  he, consequently, works in the hospital. He talks
                  about patients suffering from jaundice and yellow
                  fever and mentions the poor health of James May, Hugh
                  Norton and Josiah Burnett, as well as the death of
                  Billy Pruett from eating "too much beef liver." In
                  spite of their complaints, he notes that the health
                  of the men in camp is improving. He alludes to having
                  received bad news from Texas, and then states that he
                  will probably not come home as long as he is healthy
                  or until peace is declared. The postscript states
                  that James will try to send for things via any
                  returning soldiers.</p>

                  <p>James Booker reports that his company is healthier
                  than it has been for some time. He has heard about
                  fighting at Falls Church the day before, and reports
                  a conversation with a man from the Danville Grays,
                  who told him that the Yankees are within four miles
                  of his company at Fairfax Court House. From this
                  information, James Booker predicts that a "hard
                  battle" will soon take place. He mentions getting a
                  letter from Addie (perhaps Drury Addison Blair),
                  whose condition is improving.</p>

                  <p>This letter is a reply to one or more letters that
                  James had received from his cousin and "sweethearts"
                  a few days earlier. He has just heard that his
                  regiment is about to move into their winter quarters
                  in Gainesville. He will join it when the winter
                  quarters are ready. Meanwhile, the work in his
                  current quarters is lighter and the pay better. He
                  believes the fighting in Centreville will not
                  continue past winter. He mentions meeting a man who
                  had been captured by the Union and who was recently
                  released. According to this man, there are 60,000
                  sick Yankees in Washington. He also adds that he has
                  heard that two men in Centreville were shot for
                  trying to kill their commanding officer. James closes
                  the letter by asking to be remembered to cousin Eliza
                  Ann Williams and to all the "ladies" at Christmas
                  time.</p>

                  <p>Writing from the company's winter quarters near
                  the battlefield of First Manassas, John Booker
                  describes his brother James' sickness, which has left
                  him weak and without an appetite. Other soldiers,
                  including Nathaniel Robertson and Neal Gilbert, have
                  struggled with illness; one, Josiah Burnett, has
                  died. Booker ends his letter by expressing his
                  pleasure at having received his cousin Unity's letter
                  and apologizing that his brother James was unable to
                  write.</p>

                  <p>James Booker explains why he has been so long in
                  answering Unity's latest letters, stating that he has
                  been in hospital, too ill to write. He had hoped to
                  come home on furlough, but has been separated from
                  his regiment and could not obtain leave. He asks that
                  Unity write to him with the location of his regiment.
                  He also complains about the quality of the food and
                  mentions seeing many acquaintances on their way to
                  the front. He closes by asking his cousin to direct

                  G. Banks.</p>

                  <p>James Booker writes to inform his cousin of the
                  location of his regiment. He indicates that they have
                  been shot at but infrequently hit. He mentions that a
                  man named Tucker, who was wounded in the chin, was
                  the only man from his regiment (he was attached to
                  Captain Carter's Company F) to have been shot. He
                  also notes that many men, mainly Yankees, were killed
                  at last Wednesday's battle and that this evening the
                  Yankees flew a truce flag in order to safely bury
                  their dead. He feels that, because the best of both
                  armies are here, the war will be settled here. He
                  closes by asking that Unity write soon, and direct
                  her letters to him at Yorktown. He also asks her to
                  notify "sister Mary" that Pickney has not yet
                  arrived.</p>

                  that, since leaving the Orange Court House, the

                  <p>James begins by apologizing for the tardiness of
                  his letter: he explains that he has been ill. He then
                  discusses the practice of substitution (arranging for
                  a replacement in the army), concluding that it is
                  having a bad effect on the Confederate Army. He also
                  discusses his work assignment and his health. In a
                  separate letter on the same paper, John tells his
                  cousin about his cold and sore throat. He also states
                  that there is currently no fighting, but he can hear
                  the Yankees firing cannonade "down on the river."</p>

                  are in good health. They have been marching hard but
                  usually have not gotten enough to eat. Booker reports
                  that the general feeling in the camp is that peace
                  will come soon. Four sick conscripts have arrived
                  (and are named). James complains of having to march
                  in wet clothing after crossing bridge-less streams.
                  He also notes that the sick and wounded have been
                  ordered from Winchester to Staunton and thinks that
                  everyone else will be going to Richmond soon. James
                  looks forward to going there since he has not heard
                  from home since leaving Richmond. He greets other
                  family members and mentions that John will write

                  <p>Claiming that he would be able to "stand" being a
                  soldier if he received enough to eat, James Booker
                  notes that recently the supply of food has been
                  adequate, but that the men have not gotten enough
                  salt. James Booker notes the illnesses of two men in
                  camp, Bage Pritchett and John Hundley. He compares
                  the entrepreneurship of the Yankees with the more
                  whimsical quality of the Quakers' mercantilism and
                  notes the use of Confederate money and specie to buy
                  provisions. He also describes a month-long religious
                  revival meeting underway in camp.</p>

                  <p>Writing on the Sabbath, James Booker tells his
                  cousin that both he and his brother are well. The
                  members of Company D marched for the past ten days,
                  and they expect to march again the next day, since
                  they are following the movements of the Union troops.
                  A few days previously, the Union had surprised the
                  Confederate cavalry, but the Confederates managed to
                  drive their enemies across the river and take several
                  hundred prisoners. Complaining that "the Yankees is
                  getting too mean to live," James Booker writes that
                  they steal and destroy Southern property, such as
                  meat, corn, and horses. He notes, "I still live in
                  hope of peace soon though I may not live to see it."
                  He observes that at a "very interesting" camp meeting
                  several men, including Captain Herndon, were
                  converted.</p>

                  has ordered his troops to respect private property.
                  He describes the flourishing condition of
                  Pennsylvania farms, noting that this part of the
                  country has not yet felt the effects of the war.
                  James perceives disunity in the people's attitude
                  toward the war, comments on the abolitionists'
                  motives, and mentions that he is boarding at a

                  <p>Writing a few days after Gettysburg, James Booker
                  describes the heavy losses suffered by his division
                  during Pickett's Charge; most of the regiment's
                  officers and many of the enlisted men were killed,
                  wounded, or captured during the assault. James and
                  John Booker escaped harm, though they were nearly
                  taken prisoner by the Union forces. His division has
                  been assigned to escort 5000-6000 Union prisoners to
                  the South. He reports hearing daily of small battles
                  and expects another major battle imminently, although
                  he does not expect his division to be involved
                  because it is on guard in Williamsport, a city where
                  most of the citizens appear to favor the North.</p>

                  <p>John Booker writes that he is happy that Chloe
                  enjoyed the revival meeting at Hermon (perhaps the
                  Mount Hermon Baptist Church near Danville), then
                  notes that there is "good preaching" at the camp. He
                  contends that "the prosspect for peece is very gloomy
                  now," given that both sides are preparing for war
                  with more intensity than ever. He reports that,
                  despite rumors, Pickett's division will remain in
                  Virginia. The troops are elated at this news, even
                  though they have little more to do than guard camp
                  and drill three times a day. In a postscript, James
                  Booker asks Chloe Unity Blair to send his letter to
                  his sister soon.</p>

                  <p>Apparently upset that he did not receive a
                  furlough, James Booker wishes for the warmth and
                  comforts of home, writing, "there is none of them
                  that knows how to appreciate a blessing until they
                  are deprived of it." Still, he admits, in wartime he
                  should find satisfaction simply in having enough to
                  eat and enjoying good health; but he cannot be
                  satisfied when speculators sell food to women and
                  children at inflated prices. He observes that the
                  married soldiers have sent for their wives and were
                  boarding them at the homes of local citizens. He
                  observes that General Corse's Brigade had been at the
                  camp near Petersburg, but that they were sent to
                  Tennessee. He also mentions writing to his sister
                  Mary, telling her that he did not need clothing, as
                  he received the box that "you all" sent him. The
                  letter closes with a one-page postscript stating that
                  John made a potato pie, and Cousin Tom ate with the
                  two of them. He sends his regards to Cousin Pollie
                  Ann and mentions that Cousin William Blair and Luther
                  are stationed nearby but will be leaving for
                  Chatanooga, Tennessee, within the next two days. He
                  closes asking for Unity to return his "soldier
                  likeness" to him so he can exchange it for a new
                  one.</p>

                  <p>After observing that letters from home bring him
                  great pleasure, John Booker chastises his cousin for
                  not writing sooner. He notes that "Flem" Gregory has
                  been ill, but is recuperating. Then he launches into
                  a complaint that energizes the letter: Captain John
                  Herndon is too "lazy" to grant the soldiers in his
                  company furloughs, even though it is Christmas time,
                  and even though the men are not doing anything, not
                  even picket duty. So discontented are the soldiers
                  that many say they will not re-enlist. John Booker
                  claims that he opposes desertion, but that the
                  wealthier men who paid substitutes to serve in the
                  army should have to join, while veteran soldiers
                  should receive furloughs. Angered at the inequality,
                  John exclaims, "this is a rich mans war an a poor
                  mans fight." He ends his letter by observing that
                  Memory Inman, another member of the D Company, is
                  heading home to get married.</p>

                  <p>Booker reports that although his regiment had
                  begun to march to meet the Yankees in battle, the
                  Union had attacked --and been defeated by --another
                  group of Confederate soldiers thirty-five miles away.
                  He reports that the winter has been fairly pleasant
                  and that food is cheap and plentiful. Despite such
                  abundance, he notes, soldiers have been stealing food
                  from local residents. He mentions a serious theft of
                  $18,000 from the Quarter Master; soldiers are
                  suspected of the deed. James expresses concern over
                  General Barton's attitude towards the Regiment.
                  (Barton has said his men come from "rags and
                  thieves.") James complains that after three years of
                  service he has still not received a furlough. He
                  closes the letter with a stanza from "Amazing
                  Grace."</p>

                  <p>John Booker describes the attempt by Virginia
                  Governor William "Extra Billy" Smith and Colonel
                  [Joseph Robert] Cabell to make the men of the 38th
                  Regiment re-enlist. He deplores the strategies they
                  used: calling the men to stand before the "Colors,"
                  declaring that any man who wanted to be a slave to
                  the enemy should not re-enlist. John fears that his
                  leaders want to continue to fight at all costs,
                  rather than press for peace; and as long as men
                  re-enlist the war will go on. John also expresses his
                  dissatisfaction with the administration of the
                  Regiment: only the men who re-enlist are granted
                  furloughs, and John has still not received the
                  furlough owed to him in 1862. He mentions that the
                  two new recrutes to Company D are receiving their
                  furloughs ahead of him. Changing the subject, John
                  writes of nearby Union activity and says that they
                  have been expecting a raid. Finally, he writes of
                  Memory Inman's court martial and Captain John
                  Herndon's marriage. He closes the letter by
                  apologizing for its angry tone, writing, "I have bin
                  mad all day."</p>
