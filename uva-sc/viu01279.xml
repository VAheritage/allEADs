      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection of 104 items, 1835-1920, pertains chiefly
         to the McChesney family of Augusta County, Virginia. There are
         personal correspondence, business and legal correspondence,
         and business papers of Zachariah J. McChesney and his sons
         Adam McChesney and William J. B. McChesney. Business papers of
         Mrs. Ann M. Cochran are also included. Zachariah J. McChesney
         married Nancy Bell on April 23, 1822. The McChesney residence
         was "Spring Hill," Augusta County.</p>
      <p>Personal correspondence, 1853-1884, relates personal and
         family news. On December 21, 1853, William J. B. McChesney,
         Springfield, writes to his father, Zachariah J. McChesney,
         Brownsburg, Rockbridge County, concerning the boys Harvey and
         Henry having left home without any just provocation and his
         being disheartened at his latest defeats. In his March 19,
         1855 letter, Harvey W. Lincoln, Wethersfield, Illinois, writes
         about family and friends in Sheldon and discusses the concerns
         associated with his father having to fence his land which is
         about a mile and a half from the Kewanee railroad station. On
         February 1, 1856, Zachariah J. McChesney, Staunton, writes to
         his son, William J. B. McChesney, Barter Brooks, mentioning
         the death of "Amory," a servant, questioning whether his son
         may not be safe, and agreeing to Hanger driving their stock.
         Ann E. Starke in Georgia writes to Mrs. [Ann M.] Cochran in
         Richmond on December 3, 1857, expressing "how dear the very
         soil of Virginia was to my heart, apart from friends and
         kindred..." and reminiscing about Virginia friends. A letter
         of February 2, 1860 describes a trip to and arrival in Mt.
         Sidney, Augusta County. A biography of Zachariah J. McChesney
         and a sketch of the residence of Adam McChesney is mentioned
         in a letter of August 9, 1884 from Waterman, Watkins and
         Company to be included in their publication [Historical Atlas
         of Augusta County, Virginia]. Included in the book is the
         sketch of the residence of Adam McChesney in South River
         District, Augusta County. [Other information on "Spring Hill"
         is located in accession #38-166]. There is an incomplete
         letter, ca. 1885, from S. L. McKellar, discussing cloths and
         accessories for dressmaking, mentioning attending a Union Camp
         Meeting in Anderson, [California] and a fair, commenting on
         [George] Hearst (1820-1891) being a candidate for the Senate
         and on his wife, [Phoebe Apperson Hearst], being a proud
         woman. An undated letter from S. L. Highland to Adam McChesney
         concerns a financial matter involving his cousin, Zack
         McChesney and the sale of the Hunter and Rockbridge farms.</p>
      <p>Among the personal correspondence is an interesting letter,
         December 19, 1878, from L[eander] J. McCormick (1819-1900) of
         Chicago, Illinois, to Zachariah J. McChesney of Staunton,
         Virginia. He first expresses sympathy in a kind and empathetic
         manner for the death of McChesney's wife, [Nancy (Bell)
         McChesney]. McCormick discusses at length his father, Robert
         McCormick (1780-1846), who devoted his energies and inventive
         mind to an enterprise in which his name is scarcely known. He
         refers to his father's inventions, including the McCormick
         wheat reaper, hemp break with horse power, threshing machine,
         smith's bellows, hillside plow, water down, and clover
         sheller.</p>
      <p>Business and legal correspondence, 1843-1884, are chiefly
         concerned with the financial and legal matters of Zachariah J.
         McChesney and his sons, Adam and William J. B. There are
         several business letters pertaining to the sale of cattle. On
         February 14, 1857, Jacob M. Ruff, President of the North River
         N[avigation] Company, Lexington, requests that Zachariah
         McChesney make an investment in the company's coupon bonds and
         relates the current situation of the company and its financial
         problems. In a February 14, 1876 letter, Joseph G. Steele
         writes Zachariah J. McChesney concerning the settlement of the
         guardian accounts of Mrs. F[rances] McChesney as guardian of
         her children. There are also two letters from Staunton
         attorney and judge George M[offett] Harrison (1847-1923) to
         Zachariah J. McChesney. A November 23, 1876 letter concerns
         judgments on McChesney's claims which should be sent to the
         bank for collection. On August 20, 1877, Harrison writes a
         lengthy letter providing the requested opinions on several
         matters, including the United State Revenue laws and a
         landowner's responsibility for a distillery erected on his
         premises, the Old Central Bank and a suit involving its
         shareholders, and the claim against William A. Mann, Col.
         Massie's estate, and others in Rockbridge County.</p>
      <p>Business papers, 1855-1858, of Mrs. Ann M. Cochran, are
         mainly accounts for cloth and sewing accessories and clothing.
         There is also a bill for carpeting and one for an iron rail,
         ornamental gate and stone curb.</p>
      <p>Business papers, 1835-1920, of the McChesney family pertain
         to various aspects of the mercantile business. There is a
         receipt, January 26, 1847, from George W. McChesney to
         Zachariah J. McChesney for the purchase of the plantation on
         which the former now lives. There are accounts for smith work
         (March 22, 1850), saddlery (February 14, 1870 and May 19,
         1873), and cattle sales (October 31, 1876). There is a large
         account, July 9, 1858, with A. M. Canon for foodstuffs and
         various supplies, including educational books such as 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">McGuffey Reader</title>, a spelling
         book, and a dictionary. There is a guardian account, 1865, to
         Zachariah J. McChesney as guardian of Zach: McChesney from J.
         M. Watson for medicine and supplies. A letter, December 17,
         1883, from Killian and Henkel of Waynesboro, requests that
         Zachariah J. McChesney settle his son's account with bonds on
         himself and encloses the said large account of Adam McChesney.
         There is a letter and statement, May 12, 1920, from Black Rock
         Radium Springs Hotel to H. R. Clemm of Staunton, concerning
         the purchase of their radium water. There are also several
         accounts, 1866-1876, with T. H. Antrim and Company of
         Waynesboro for various staple and dry goods.</p>
      <p>Legal papers, 1839-1875, include documents relating to the
         McChesney family. There is an indenture, February 16, 1844,
         between Isaac and Nancy M. Hall and Zachariah J. McChesney
         concerning a certain tract of land in Augusta County to be
         held in trust for Frances A. McChesney. A memorandum of
         agreement, dated August 1, 1855, between William J. B.
         McChesney and John T. Huff, is for the purpose of carrying on
         the mercantile business at Barter Brooks in Augusta County
         under the firm of John T. Huff and Company. There is also an
         undated survey of "Spring Hill," Augusta County.</p>
