</head>
      <p>Staige Davis Blackford (1931-2003) was the son of Lydia Harper Fishburne
                Blackford and Dr. Staige Davis Blackford (1898-1949), a physician at the
                University of Virginia and the medical director for the Eighth evacuation team
                during World War II. Staige was the nephew of Dr. Launcelot Minor Blackford (Uncle
                Whang 1894-1964) the author of "Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory." Staige
                attended Episcopal High School, a private school in Alexandria, Virginia where his
                grandfather (Launcelot Minor Blackford 1837-1914) had been the headmaster. In
                1948 Staige was admitted to the University of Virginia and graduated with a B. A.
                with honors in 1952. He was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to Queen's College Oxford
                University from 1952 to 1954 graduating with a B. A. in Modern History. He served in
                the United States Air Force from 1955 to 1957 as a first Lieutenant. He also worked
                for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1954 to 1958 specializing in Eastern Europe
                during the Hungarian Revolution. In 1958 he obtained his first writing job as a
                reporter for Time, Inc. and married Florence "Bettina" Balding Blackford. In 1960 he
                was an assistant editor for Collier's Encyclopedia and in 1961 he worked for the
                Grolier Society Inc. Later that year he became an assistant director in the
                editorial department for the Louisiana State Press. From 1962 to 1964 he worked at
                the Southern Regional Council, Inc. In 1964 he accepted a job as a reporter and
                writer for the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginian-Pilot</title> in Norfolk Virginia.
                He was also a speech writer and press secretary for Governor Linwood Holton before
                moving to Charlottesville in 1973 to work as a special assistant to University of
                Virginia Presidents Edgar Finley Shannon, and Frank L. Hereford. He was also editor
                of the Virginia Quarterly Review, a position that he kept until 2003.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection consists of 3,609 items, 13 hollinger boxes, and 5 linear feet and
                contains the papers of Staige Blackford, which are mostly correspondence with his
                family, friends and colleagues and newspaper clippings of his articles. Also
                included are newspaper articles written by his daughter, Linda Blackford. The
                letters written by Staige Blackford are very descriptive, rich in character, and
                give information about the University of Virginia, as well as personal details about
                people, politics and current events in Charlottesville, and around the world.
                Blackford was a journalist at heart, showing curiosity and writing about all aspects
                of human life. Correspondents include Vernon E. Jordan, Jr., Peter Batty, Ward Just,
                Steve Hochman, Sally Bruce McClatchey, Monty and Sally Yudelman, Antonia and
                Faustina Berenguer, Robert and Jean Bower, Elliot and Kevin Levitas, John Funari, F.
                Rawdon Dalrymple, Ed Crawford, Ed and Ginger Barber, Barbara and Jean Murphy,
                Kenneth Winfred Thompson, Alden Read, Junious R. Fishburne, Howard J. and Binky
                Burnett, Alexander "Sandy" Gilliam, Andrew D. Hart, Helen Dewar (<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Washington Post</title> correspondent,) Martin and Celia Ochs,

                Mason (<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia-Pilot</title>,) Alfred McCormick, A. Hewson
                Michie, Jr., Ed Elson, Launcelot Minor Blackford, former governor, Linwood Holton,
                Edgar and Eleanor Shannon, R. W. "Johnny" Apple, Frank Hereford, Larry Sabato, Mary
                Lee Settle, and William "Widdy" Tazewell. There is brief correspondence with former
                president William Jefferson Clinton, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Colgate Darden, Robert
                O'Neil, and John Casteen.</p>
      <p>The family correspondence originates with his grandfather Clement "Par" Fishburne who
                wrote letters to his daughter, (Staige's mother) Lydia Harper Fishburne in 1913.
                "Par" Fishburne's letters are also extremely descriptive and well written. There are
                also many letters from Staige's mother and sister which reveal that Staige possessed
                at a young age, a great talent for using words to describe the passion behind his
                feelings and ideas. The family correspondence is from 1913 to 1924; 1943 to 1962;
                and 1984-2003. The general correspondence is from 1945 to 2003 and contains
                letters to friends, colleagues, charities as well as reference letters.</p>
      <p>Besides correspondence and newspaper clippings, the collection contains the personal
                papers of Staige Blackford such as college admission letters for his daughter,
                Linda, insurance and financial papers, genealogical information, an autobiography of
                Staige Davis Blackford, Sr., an original manuscript of Launcelot Minor Blackford's
                [Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory,] information about being a Rhodes scholar, speeches
                written by Staige Blackford including speeches and itineraries for Linwood Holton, a
                speech by the Reverend John Spong about Vietnam, and United States Army papers.</p>

                            Linda. Also included are letters to Staige from his grandfather, Clement
                            "Par" Fishburne. The letters reveal that Staige was homesick and unhappy
                            at Episcopal High School. Staige wrote about the surrender of Germany
                            and his alienation from the celebrations that were taking place. He
                            complained that when Germany surrendered, he was taking a Latin test.
                            Also included is a letter from A. X. Huxton assuring Dr. Blackford that
                            Staige was doing fine work.</p>

          <p>There is correspondence of Staige Blackford with his daughters, Linda and
                            Sheila. Staige wrote about John Casey's new novel "The Half Life of
                            Love" (sic Happiness) which supposedly took place in Charlottesville and
                            the college president might have been based on John Casteen. In other
                            UVA news, Staige wrote that the fraternities and the rushing process
                            might be changed to the second semester; and about a fiasco in which two
                            babies were accidently switched at the hospital. In the political arena
                            he wondered if Doug Wilder was too "thin skinned" to be president of a
                            college. On the national front, he wrote that Vernon E. Jordan was being
                            remembered only as "Clinton's lackey" after all the great work he did
                            for civil rights. He also mentioned Mary Lee Settle's autobiography and
                            that Mary Lee and Ann Beattie had a falling out followed by a
                            rapprochement.</p>

                            discussed at the University were a liberal studies degree in Qatar and
                            the naming of the College at Wise. Staige also made reference to
                            Governor Jim Gilmore as "Big Jim."</p>

                            letters. President John Casteen gave a dinner at Carr's Hill to honor
                            Blackford for his twenty-five years at the Virginia Quarterly Review and
                            the seventy-fifth anniversary of the VQR. Included are photographs from
                            the event. In other news, Staige called Tom Bliley, "Mr. Tobacco" and
                            wrote that it had been revealed that the late John Battle had an affair
                            with his secretary for twenty years.</p>

          <p>Staige was working as a research director for the Southern Regional
                            Council and wanted to obtain a position at a University Press or a
                            newspaper. He accepted a job with The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk. Staige
                            also mentioned that his working for the CIA was a mistake because it
                            took him away from his writing. He wrote that his uncle, L. Minor
                            Blackford passed away from complications from emphysema. There is also a
                            letter from the editor of Civil War History criticizing L. Minor
                            Blackford's manuscript "Ride, Boldly, Ride" (about Frank Robertson)</p>
