      <p>The regiment had been mustered into United States service
         on October 11, 1861. During the course of the events discussed
         in these letters Baer's regiment was assigned to the Second
         Brigade, (James) Shields' Division, (Nathaniel Prentiss)
         Banks' V Corps, Department of the Shenadndoah (March-May,
         1862); V Corps, Department of the Rappahannock (May-July,
         1862); and Ferry's Brigade, Suffolk Division, VII Corps,
         Department of Virginia (September-December). According to
         Charles M. Clark's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The History of the Thirty-Ninth
         Regiment Illinois Volunteer Veteran Infantry (Yates Phalanx)
         In the War of the Rebellion, 1861-1865</title>, Baer enlisted
         at Rook's Creek on August 12, 1861. He was later wounded
         during the final assault on Fort Gregg (Petersburg Campaign)
         on April 2, 1865, and was promoted a month later.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The major portion of this collection consists of eight
         letter, May to December 1862, written by Joseph Baer, a Union
         soldier of Company C, Thirty-Ninth Illinois Infantry (known as
         the Yates Phalanx), (Orris Sanford) Ferry's Brigade, (John
         James) Peck's Division, IV Corps, Army of the Potomac.</p>
      <p>Baer's letters are addressed to his wife Sarah at their
         home in Low Point, Woodford County, Illinois, while he was
         stationed at Suffolk, Virginia. He also writes from other
         Virginia locales such as Columbia Bridge, Front Royal, and
         Harrison's Landing and describes camp life and picket duty,
         the weather, and various farming and family matters. Also
         mentioned is his regiment's operations against Thomas J.
         "Stonewall" Jackson's forces during the Valley Campaign and
         Union expedititions and skirmishes at Blackwater Bridge near
         Suffolk. In addition, Baer mentions or describes: "the boys"
         wrestling outside his tent as he tries to write a letter to
         his wife (July 23); his need of postage stamps (June 27); the
         transfer of a Pontiac, Illinois regiment to Tennessee where
         they have "god to se the allafent" (gone to see the elephant,"
         i.e., to see the sights and to gain experience for life); an
         expedition to Blackwater Bridge led by General (Robert
         Sanford) Foster which included the Thirteenth Indiana Regiment
         and of the successful capture and burning of a Confederate
         camp (November 19). In his December 31 letter Baer describes
         local Confederate soldiers as being well-armed, fed, and
         trained, and of his decision not to pretend an illness in
         order to obtain leave to visit his family.</p>
      <p>Several of the letters bear patriotic letterheads, and the
         envelope for the July 23 letter has an embossed likeness of
         General George B. McClellan holding an American flag with the
         caption "Commander of the Federal Forces on the Potomac."</p>
      <p>Also present is a letter written June 27, 1862, by
         "Charley" to "Nellie." He comments about hearing the sounds of
         fighting near his regiment (Battle of Mechanicsville, June 26)
         and tells her that accurate accounts of the battle could be
         found in newspapers. His July 2 postscript, written on the
         James River six miles from Fort Darling, site of a Confederate
         battery on Drewry's Bluff south of Richmond, states that he
         and comrades had spent the last three days in combat (probably
         the Seven Days' Battle).</p>
