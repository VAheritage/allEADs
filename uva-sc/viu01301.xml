      <p>Prior to 1992, L.F. Payne served on the House of
         Representatives Public Works and Transportation Committee and
         the House Budget Committee. In 1992, Payne was appointed to

         1939, H.R. 997, H.R. 860, and H.R. 789.</p>
      <p>Lewis Franklin Payne, Jr., was born in Amherst County,
         Virginia, on July 9, 1945, and attended the Amherst County
         public schools. Payne received his B.S. degree in Civil
         Engineering from the Virginia Military Institute in 1967, and
         his M.B.A. from the University of Virginia Darden School of
         Business in 1973, after serving as a company commander in the
         United States Army Corps of Engineers, 1968-1970, and three
         years in the U.S. Army Reserves. He worked as a staff
         engineering associate with the C &amp; P Telephone Company,
         1970-1971; and a planning and development manager of
         Wintergreen Development Company, Inc., Wintergreen, Virginia,
         (1973- 1975); later serving as president (1976-1985) and
         chairman of the board (1985-1988).</p>
      <p>Payne is also on the Board of Directors of the Patrick
         Henry Boys Foundation, a member of the American Legion Post 16
         in Lynchburg, and a trustee of the Rockfish Presbyterian
         Church in Nellysford, Virginia. As president of the Nelson
         County Community Development Foundation, Payne developed
         Montreal Village in Nelson County, Virginia, to promote homes
         for low and middle income families. Montreal Village won the
         Department of Housing and Urban Development Certification of
         National Merit in 1989.</p>
      <p>Payne was elected as a Democrat to the 100th Congress, June
         14, 1988, by special election to fill the vacancy caused by
         the death of Wilbur Clarence (Dan) Daniel and served from 1988
         to 1996, when he resigned to run in the election for Lt.
         Governor of Virginia. From 1990-1992, Payne served on the
         Veteran's Affairs Committee and the House Public Works and
         Transportation Committee where he was instrumental in
         achieving reforms to the federal highway funding formulas that
         increased Virginia's allocation of highway funds.</p>

         Committee, as a leading proponent of the Balanced Budget
         Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the line-item veto, and a
         seven year balanced budget plan developed in 1995 by the
         "Coalition," a group of moderate-to-conservative House
         Democrats that Payne helped establish in the 104th Congress,
         whose members are known as "Blue Dog Democrats." From 1993
         until 1996, Payne was a member of the House Ways and Means
         Committee, serving on its Social Security and Trade
         subcommittees. L.F. Payne is married to Susan King and they
