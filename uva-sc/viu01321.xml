        <p>The Moore papers were bequeathed to the University of
            Virginia Library by John Travers Moore, Hendersonville,
            North Carolina, through his executor E.K. Morley, on

      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Information about the life and publications of Margaret and
         John Travers Moore can be found throughout the collection but
         particularly in the Memorabilia Series in the Introduction to
         the Files (Box 25) compiled by John T. Moore, 1984-1994, which
         reveals much about how Moore viewed their work and their
         relationships to publishers, friends, and family. About eleven
         hundred letters listed in this introduction were housed in
         photographic albums but these were removed and interfiled for
         preservation purposes. Other files with personal information
         include: Certificates and Awards (Box 24), Genealogy and
         Family History (Box 24), Photographs (Box 25), Newsclippings
         (Box 25), Scrapbooks of Press Releases and Poems published in
         Periodicals (Box 26), and the oversize photograph album
         arranged in rough chronological order and identified by
         Moore.</p>
      <p>Published sources include Contemporary Authors (1995), The
         Marquis Who's Who in America, page 2435 (1994) and Who's Who
         in American Women (1982).</p>

         (1903-1984) and John Travers Moore (1908-1994), ca. 1914-1994,
         ca. 8,000 items (27 Hollinger boxes; 11 linear shelf feet),
         poets and authors who published their material in a wide
         variety of journals, magazines, and books from the 1930's
         until John Moore's death in 1994. The papers include published
         and unpublished literary manuscripts, correspondence, audio
         and video recordings, artwork, memorabilia, bound volumes,
         photographs, books (transferred to the Rare Books Division),

         John Travers Moore and paintings by Robert J. Smith, a friend
         of Moore's, and sheet music by Moore.</p>
      <p>The manuscripts series (Boxes 1-14) contains mostly
         unpublished manuscripts. Those that have been published
         include: 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">All Along the Way, The First Moon
         Landing, How Can I Show You God, Jeannette?, The Little Band
         and the Inaugural Parade, Pepito's Journey, Pepito's Speech at
         the United Nations, Pepito's World, Sappho's
         Poetry,</title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Story of Silent Night</title>.</p>
      <p>The correspondence series (Boxes 15-23) contains
         correspondence with editors and publishers, friends and
         family, and others, arranged alphabetically by folder title.
         Persons with their own correspondence folders include: Jean
         Pierre and Muriel de Chambrun (friends of the Moores for
         almost forty years); James E. Creekman (Moore's dismissed
         attorney); Harris and Hazel Huston (some of his oldest
         friends; Harris attended law school with Moore and served in
         the American Embassy at Curacao, Netherlands Antilles); Tina
         Miller (editor at D.C. Heath and Company); nephew Jerry Moore
         (writes concerning Moore family genealogy and news); Margaret
         and John Moore to each other; Margaret and John Moore to their
         parents; George and Peggy Rumberger; artist and friend Robert
         Smith and Nancy Mackey (his daughter), see also drawings by
         Smith (Box 24) and list of large paintings at the end of the
         guide; and the University of Virginia, chiefly Edmund
         Berkeley, concerning Moore's intention of making the
         University the repository for his literary work.</p>
      <p>The correspondence, 1929-1988, with George and Peggy
         Rumberger, Margaret's brother and sister-in-law, contains
         fourteen letters and photographs, 1944-1945, concerning the
         service of George Rumberger in the Corps of Engineers, U.S.
         Army, in Burma as a master sergeant during World War II.
         Rumberger won a citation for the Bronze Star for his advance
         planning for the Stillwell Road. Other items present in the
         Rumberger folder include a map of North Burma with Rumberger's
         notes about his itinerary and the area written in the margins.
         He also describes his experiences in Burma and India,
         mentioning riding elephants, hunting tigers, the deprivations
         and hardships of the soldiers, the Ledo Road, the dense and
         isolated jungles, and a Buddhist school in Burma. The folders
         of correspondence with individuals is the best source for
         personal information about the Moore's missing from the other
         files.</p>

         bonds (Box 15); contracts (Box 15); copyrights (Box 16);
