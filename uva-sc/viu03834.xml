      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection consists of 40 items, 1873-1878 and 1983, letters (electrostatic copies) of the James S. Easley, Sr., family. The majority of the letters were written by James S. Easley, Sr., to his wife,
Elizabeth, while on business trips to: Richmond; Philadelphia; New York, Chicago; Dixon and Quincy, Illinois; Iowa City and Sioux City, Iowa; and St. Louis, Missouri, and contain references to land speculations,
railroads and cash and crops in the west, as well as to his business partners, Mr. Carrington and Mr. William W. Willingham, and occasional traveling companion, Col. [C.H.] Cabaniss. In March 12, 1837, letter,
Easley refers to the illness and impending death of James Bruce, the third person to become a millionaire in the United States, and his partner in the first chain store business. Later, in July 23, 1847, letter,
Easley refers to a dinner party given by Mrs. [Elvira Cabell Henry] Bruce which included as guests Mr. David Chalmers, future Confederate secretary of war. Post- Civil War
letters make references to officers returning home, rejoicing in the North over the downfall of "Dixie" and the "present states of negroes." These letters complement the Easley business ledgers (38-52). Letters
written by Easley from his home in Halifax Court House to his wife while she was away were mostly concerned with new of family and friends.
</p>
      <p>The remaining letters were from James S. Easley, Jr., and Robert Holt Easley to their mother, written while attending the university of Virginia. Some topics of interest include the Ugly Club elections at the
University, an account of school expenses, a visit to Monticello, a fire in Charlottesville, the inauguration of [Rutherford Birchard] Hayes as the "Supreme Magistrate of the U.S." and college life. Professors
mentioned include [James Lawrence] Cabell, [John Barbee] Minor, and [Stephen Osborne] Southall.
</p>
      <p>There is also a clipping from a Halifax, Virginia newspaper, October 1983, concerning the Easley family.
