         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection consists of six bound scrapbooks,
         1869-1915, complied by former Confederate colonel and partisan
         ranger John Singleton Mosby (1833-1916) and his daughter, Mary
         Virginia (Mosby) Campbell (1859- 1904). The scrapbooks contain
         newspaper articles relating to Mosby's life and career as well
         as miscellaneous poetry, correspondence, and related items.
         Most of the letters are typescript or carbon copies, some of
         which are signed by the correspondents, including Mosby. The
         scrapbooks frequently carry several annotations in his
         handwriting. The clippings and correspondence illustrate
         Mosby's commentary on contemporary events including the
         Spanish-American War, World War I, various presidential
         elections and appointments, editorial letters, the Civil War,
         and his visits to cities as a private citizen or as a
         government official. While the scrapbooks possess similar or
         even duplicate material, each has substantial variations in
         content which warrants their description as separate
         entities.</p>

               <p>Was compiled by Mosby's daughter, Mary Mosby
               Campbell. Its newsclippings pertain to her father's
               near-fatal accident at the University of Virginia in
               1896 (he was accidentally kicked in the head by a horse
               and suffered a fractured skull and the loss of his left
               eye), and the controversy surround his dismissal from
               the Department of Justice. Correspondents include James
               Keith, who appeals the dismissal to Attorney General
               George W. Wickersham, June 13, 1910; a letter, January
               6, 1892, from Pierre G. T. Beauregard praising a Mosby
               Gettysburg article; a Theodore Roosevelt letter in which
               he claims to be a friend of the South, September 10,
               1904; and, a note from Marcus J. Wright who claims that
               after having reviewed all of Robert E. Lee's papers (as
               part of his work for 
               <title render="italic">The War of the Rebellion</title>)
               Lee had praised Mosby more than any other officer. W. H.
               Forbes, Major N. I. O'Brion, Colonel E. Leroy Sweester,
               William H. F. Payne, and Joseph Bryan are among the

               when he was a Union quartermaster in 1865 (March 30,
               1904). There is also a letter from German General Robert
               von Massow, to W. Ben Palmer which mentions Mosby (who
               has scribbled a brief sketch of Von Massow's career at
               the bottom of the page). Von Massow had served with
               Mosby's Rangers during the Civil War; in his will he
               allegedly bequeathed $2,000,000 to be distributed among
               the command's survivors. A carbon of Ulysses S. Grant's
               parole of Mosby, February 2, 1866, is included in this
               volume. Binger Herman, Rockwood Hoar, and Roger A. Pryor
               are among the other correspondents. Newspapers
