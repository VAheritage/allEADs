      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists of fourteen beaux-arts drawings, ca. 1934-1935, by Evelina Magruder (c. 1898-), the first female graduate of the School of Architecture at the University of Virginia (in 1935). She attended the Parsons School in Interior Design in  New York, N.Y. where she also worked with a female interior designer before returning to Charlottesville to attend classes at the University of Virginia. In Charlottesville, Evelina Magruder worked independently or with local architects such as Floyd Johnson, Milton Grigg, and Henderson Heyward. Among her works was the redesign of the stable on the corner of Market and Sixth Streets into a law office, ca. 1938.</p>
      <p>Evelina Magruder was the great granddaughter of John Bowie Magruder who is listed in the Thomas Jefferson account books as supplying plank for "Monticello." <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Corks and Curls</title>(1935 edition) includes a photograph of Evelina Magruder as a third-year student in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virgonia and the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Alumni Directory 1981</title> lists her as a 1935 architecture graduate (B.S. degree).</p>
      <p>The drawings were apparently done as class exercises and are in pencil, ink, crayon, and watercolors, and include designs for an athletics building, a duplex house, "a summer residence for a popular author," a ceiling design, an open air museum, an office building, various stairways, a fountain and a pool, a technical school with a foundry and a shop, a school design, "a church for a summer colony," a walled garden of Chinese design, an interior design for a penthouse suite, and a college library.</p>
