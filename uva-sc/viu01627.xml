      <p>Jefferson writes about a certificate for Bellini's death,
         planting fruit trees and delaying the shipping of wines until
         October so they will not be spoiled by heat. He requests
         Mazzei to send him a bottle each of white Verdea and
         Muscatel.</p>

      <p>Washington May 4, 1805</p>
      <p>Dear Sir 
         <lb/><lb/>In my letter of Mar. 10, I informed you that I wrote
         that day for the certificate of Bellini's death. I now inclose
         it. I also mentioned that on the journey I was then taking to
         Monticello I should get information from your attorney Mr.
         Carr &amp; probably be able to receive &amp; make on the
         remittance for Colle. I inclose you his letter by which you
         will see we shall be delayed till the fall. I got my fruits
         all planted at Monticello, except the single plant of the
         peach apricot which was stolen by the way, however if the
         stones succeed I may expect a plenty from them. The advance of
         the season will soon determine this point. I now write to Mr.
         Appleton to delay sending my vines till October, because if
         they are sent off in the spring they will encounter all the
         summer heats in the hold of the ship, and the warehouses of
         our Seaports, and vines as delicate as the Montepulcians will
         not stand that. In winter they will come in perfect safety;
         &amp; that has come in good condition has been generally
         preferred to Burgundy or Bordeaux, because it combines equal
         flavor with less strength. I remember you brought here some
         White Verdea, &amp; Muscadell, white also, which I then
         admired. Very likely I might not think as much of them now as
         then, when everything except Madeira was a novelty, but my
         curiosity would be gratified with a single bottle of each,
         were it only to ascertain the dislocation of my palate in that
         period. Accept affectionate salutations &amp; assurances of
         constant esteem &amp; respect.</p>
      <p>Thomas Jefferson 
         <lb/><lb/>Philip Mazzei</p>
