      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 900 items (two Hollinger
         boxes, ca. ten linear shelf inches), principally
         correspondence dating from 1829 to 1841, documenting the
         Richmond, Virginia-based tobacco business of Daniel, John, and
         Bryce Stewart and their uncle, Norma Stewart. Bryce Stewart
         acted as a field agent for his brothers and later managed the
         family crop and warehouse in Clarksville, Tennessee, which had
         been set up by John in the early 1830s. At the Clarksville
         factory the Stewart brothers purchased tobacco leaves and stem
         from area planters, dried and processed them and then shipped
         the crop via the Cumberland and Mississippi Rivers to New
         Orleans. The company also dealt in New York and abroad.</p>
      <p>These papers document the tobacco business and factors
         which influenced it such as weather and health conditions, the
         price of slaves, banking policies, currency fluctuations, and
         shipping. There is also material regarding insurance policies,
         insurance claims, and law suits. Of particular interest are
         offical price lists for the port of New Orlenas including the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">New Orleans Price Current and
         Commerical Intelligencer--Letter Sheet</title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Merchants Transcript of New
         Orleans Price Current</title>, which were sent with covering
         letters to the Stewarts by their agents.</p>
      <p>Also of note is a letter dated 25 December 1835 from one of
         their agents, Charles Oxley, to Norman Stewart. Oxley reports
         on the life of a tobacco agent in New Orleans, detailing
         everything from his uncomfortable journey, which included
         wading twenty miles through the Chattahoochee Swamp in
         Georgia, to the difficulty that the tobacco people encounter
         in finding adequate shelter in New Orleans. The high cost of
         lodging and board are of particular concern, as he remarks
         that the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">increase in strangers both here
         and in Mobile is so great that the rents have risen at least
         five and twenty percent</title>and how he now must pay $100
         for a room that used to cost him $80. He observes that 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">tobacco must be more profitable
         than it is at the present to stand such extravagant
         rates.</title>Account sheets and bills of lading are also
         included.</p>
      <p>Besides business correspondence there are also personal
         letters from family members such as Eliza J. Stewart, wife of
         Bryce Stewart (11 Jul 1841 and 12 Oct 1841) and Isabella
         Stewart (28 May 1835) writing to her brother Daniel from the
         family's home in Rothesay, Scotland. In addition there are
         several letters which describe the travels of John Walker, a
         cousin of the Stewarts and agent for the family company. His
         letter of 28 August 1934 is an account of his trip by
         horseback from Rishmond to Lynchburg where he describes his
         stops, the condition of the roads, and the state of the
         tobacco crop along the way. He comments that he was less
         fatigued traveling by horseback than by coach and that except
         for the rain, it is 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">a most agreeable way of
         traveling.</title></p>
      <p>In another letter dated 30 August 1833 he describes his
         first visit to New York City and upstate New York remarking on
         the concourse of strangers, the difficulty in obtaining
         comfortable quarters, and the bargain transportation; one
         could take an omnibus from Wall Street to the upper end of
         Broadway for fifteen cents. He also reported on his travels to
         the Shaker Community in Lebannon, New York where he observed
         their practice of dance as an act of divine worship. He
         describes this as one of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">most remarkable sights to be seen
         in this quarter of the United States,</title>likening its
         beauty to the falls of Niagara and the fortifications at
         Quebec.</p>
