         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This farm account book, 1851-1888, was kept by George B.
         Tyler and Robert H. Tyler of "The Shelter," Prince William
         County, Virginia. There are also several manuscript poems
         written by George B. Tyler. An alphabetical index begins the
         ledger. There are many accounts, 1851-1888, of George B. Tyler
         for the sale of wheat and some for corn and oats. The accounts
         were paid by cash or services used or needed by the Tylers.
         Accounts with Mary E. Tyler concern the rent of "Maple
         Springs" and "The Shelter" for the years 1852 through 1856.
         Charges made to Mary E. Tyler include rent of "Maple Springs"
         and the hire of Lewis; payments were made by rent of "The
         Shelter" and the hire of Marshall. Garret Hulfish, the estate
         of Theron Newman, James T. Newman, and Cassius Foley paid
         their accounts by shop services. Robert Bentley, Jr. and
         Robert Beverley paid their accounts with several head of
         cattle. One charge made to Luther Lynn was a "difference in
         horse trade"; one method of payment by Lynn was for insurance
         for colts. Mention of a bond, January 1856, for John Janney is
         on numbered page 40. There appears to be an account for "The
         Shelter" for 1852 through 1856 following numbered page 47.</p>
         <p>The accounts of George B. Tyler and Robert H. Tyler cover
         1856 to 1867, with some miscellaneous accounts to 1888
         following. There are accounts for the sale of cattle and
         bushels of wheat, corn and oats. Dr. Jesse Ewell paid his
         accounts by medical care for "Nelson," "Black Sallie" and the
         family, by the hire of servant "Anne" for 1868, and by the
         difference in a horse trade. Doctor Pugh also paid by his
         account by medical care. Josiah T. Carter and C. J. King paid
         their accounts by blacksmithing. There is an account, January
         10, 1862, with the Confederate States, for groceries for R. H.
         Tyler. A notation follows on time lost by "Nelson" because of
         illness and a trip to Alexandria, Virginia. There are two
         accounts for African-Americans: Henry Skinner for tobacco,
         boots, and cash paid by his wages for 1867; and, "Jim" for
         shoes and cash. There are accounts involving the church and
         related matters with W. A. Alrich, W. M. Dame, R. T. Brown,
         Rev. John Ambler, and Rev. A. P. Gray. Several accounts appear
         to be with hired workers. Accounts with Charity Hailstock and
         Scott Hailstock were paid by wages. Charges to Charity
         Hailstock include cash for Mrs. Jordan, "Hannah," "Matilda,"
         and Dr. Hamilton which were paid by wages for "Hannah" for
         1868. Charges to Scott Hailstock include cash and tobacco
         which were paid by wages for himself and "Matilda" for 1868.
         Charges to John Burrell of cash were paid by his wages in
         1868. There are three accounts with women--Molly Coats, Susan
         Thomas, and Sally Berry--whose accounts were paid by bills for
         washing.</p>
