      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This addition to the papers of John Dos Passos, Jr. (1896-1970), ca.
                1908-1967, and undated, consists of ca. 65 items, chiefly family photographs
                and photograph albums but also including a certificate from the Accademia Nazionale
                dei Lincei, a science academy located in Rome, Italy, conveying the first
                international Antonio Feltrinelli award to Dos Passos (November 14, 1967) and
                correspondence.</p>
      <p>The correspondence consists of four undated letters to Patrick [Murphy] from John and
                Katy Dos Passos; three are very brief letters illustrated by Dos Passos with
                watercolors, discussing the rainy weather, summer activities, and a gift of an Aztec
                idol of jade from Mexico which he sent to Murphy as a talisman. A fourth letter
                describes an incident with Ernest Hemingway and artist Mike [Strater?] catching
                sharks on a fishing trip to Bimini Island, Bahamas, with Hemingway getting
                splattered with bits of a bullet that was accidentally discharged from his pistol by
                the convulsions of one of the sharks they had caught. They decided to return to the
                American Shoal to treat Hemingway's wounds before sailing on to Bimini.</p>
      <p>Also present is a letter, August 19, 1940, from Frances McF[adden] of 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Harper's Bazaar</title> to "Katie" Dos Passos enclosing eleven
                snapshots as a souvenir of her lovely evening at her home.</p>
      <p>There is one folder of photographs from the trip of John Dos Passos, Jr. to Argentina
                in 1948 which includes a photograph of gauchos and two photographs of John Dos
                Passos, Jr. and [Juan Peron]. Other folders of photographs include portrait poses
                and snapshots of John Dos Passos, family and friends, including John Dos Passos,
                Sr., [his uncle ?] James Madison, and probably his mother, Lucy Addison Sprigg
                Madison.</p>
      <p>The two photograph albums contain snapshots of John Dos Passos as a boy, with his
                parents, on vacation near Sandy Point, Virginia, and on board the yacht Gaivota belonging to John Randolph Dos Passos, Sr.</p>
