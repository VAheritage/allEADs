</head>
         <p>Born February 9, 1874, in Brookline, MA; died of a stroke, May 12, 1925, in Brookline, MA; daughter of Augustus and Katherine Bigelow (Lawrence) Lowell; partner of Ada Dwyer Russell (a secretary and editor). Attended Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, 1917-18, Tufts College, 1918, and Columbia University, 1920; Baylor University, Litt.D., 1920. Awarded Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1926, for <title render="italic">What's O'Clock.</title>
         </p>
         <p>An oft-quoted remark attributed to poet Amy Lowell applies to both her determined personality and her sense of humor: "God made me a business woman," Lowell is reported to have quipped, "and I made myself a poet." During a career that spanned just over a dozen years, she wrote and published over 650 poems, yet scholars cite Lowell's tireless efforts to awaken American readers to contemporary trends in poetry as her more influential contribution to literary history.</p>
         <p>In 1912, Lowell's first collection of poetry was published. <title render="italic">A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass</title> was termed by <title render="italic">Dictionary of Literary Biography</title> essayists E. Claire Healey and Laura Ingram "a typical first book, characterized by conventional themes, traditional forms, and the limitations inherent in the work of a solitary poet who had no contact with other practitioners of her art." However, the critics noted that "Lowell's honesty of expression and an occasional brilliant image provided a glimpse of what was to come." Healey and Ingram also wrote appreciatively of the design of <title render="italic">A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass,</title> which Lowell had based on a volume by early nineteenth-century British poet John Keats. A devotee of Keats's work since her teenage years, Lowell gradually amassed a collection of the author's papers and manuscripts that she would later mine for a weighty biography.</p>
         <p>After beginning a career as a poet when she was well into her thirties, Lowell became an enthusiastic student and disciple of the art. One day in 1913, after reading a number of poems signed "H.D., Imagiste," she realized that her own poetry followed in much the same literary vein. The new style of poetry she had just encountered was termed "imagism" by its main proponent, Ezra Pound.</p>
         <p>With a desire to learn more about imagism, Lowell journeyed to London with the goal of meeting with Pound; she carried with her a letter of introduction from Harriet Monroe, editor of the Chicago-based magazine <title render="italic">Poetry.</title> Lowell and Pound struck up a mutual friendship, and she also became acquainted with poet John Gould Fletcher and novelist Henry James; her trip was also noteworthy for her exposure to other modernist trends in the performing and visual arts. Back in Boston, Lowell undertook a campaign to make imagist poetry both a critical and financial success in the U.S. and began traveling often between the two countries. During one trip, in the summer of 1914, she became an unwitting player in the forming of factions among the imagists, with Pound formally abandoning the movement (for a few years) and Lowell then taking up editorship of an annual anthology of imagist poetry to which she had previously been a contributor. Anti-Pound factions among the writers believed that Pound's editorship of the anthology, as well as his general de facto leadership, exhibited too capricious a manner.</p>
         <p>Lowell's editorship of these collections of imagist poetry began in 1915 with <title render="italic">Some Imagist Poets: An Anthology,</title> to which she also contributed; two more volumes were published in subsequent years.</p>
         <p>During this era, Lowell was also writing poetry of her own and saw the publication of several volumes of verse, including <title render="italic">Sword Blades and Poppy Seed</title> in 1914, <title render="italic">Can Grande's Castle</title> in 1918, and <title render="italic">Pictures of the Floating World</title> in 1919. Lowell's own verse, highly influenced by her contact with the imagists after 1913, headed toward what she termed "unrhymed cadence," a non-metrical style she felt well-suited for the English language and based on the natural rhythms of speech. With her friend John Gould Fletcher, Lowell is credited with bringing this verse style, also called polyphonic prose, into American poetry. Lowell continued to publish volumes of poetry over the next few years, but 1921's <title render="italic">Legends</title> would be the last collection of her own work published before her death.</p>
         <p>In the early 1920s Lowell took a hiatus from the art and business of poetry to pen a biography on Keats. In <title render="italic">John Keats</title>'s 1300 pages, she attempted to show why she felt the English writer, who died in 1821, was the spiritual forebear of imagist poetry. Lowell's in-depth chronicle of Keats's short life was structured into a near day-to-day chronology, and through the wealth of Keatsiana she had amassed over the years her biography managed to clarify some issues about the poet's personal life.</p>
         <p>Lowell penned two books of literary criticism, 1915's <title render="italic">Six French Poets: Studies in Contemporary Literature,</title> and <title render="italic">Tendencies in Modern American Poetry,</title> published in 1917.  In her later years, despite increasingly poor health, Lowell continued to devote her energies to winning over the American public to an appreciation of contemporary poetry. She undertook lecture tours, professing to relish oratorical opportunities. More importantly, she used her social connections, financial independence, and forthright personality to boost the careers of other poets, providing feedback, recommending their work to others, acting as a liaison with editors, and writing articles on the subject. Carl Sandburg was one recipient of Lowell's support.</p>
         <p>Lowell's <title render="italic">A Critical Fable,</title> published in 1922, was a literary answer to <title render="italic">A Fable for Critics,</title> an earlier work written by her cousin James Russell Lowell. It was a lighthearted satire on the literary currents of her day and the business of writing.</p>
         <p>By 1920 Lowell had been engaged for several years in a relationship with her secretary, Ada Dwyer Russell, an association that some of her biographers note seemed to have provided the poet with emotional stability and happiness for perhaps the first time in her life. Lowell penned several romantic odes to Russell over the years, including "The Temple," "Anticipation," and "The Taxi." Yet Lowell's health rapidly declined during the 1920s; a glandular condition had caused her to gain weight, and the excess weight then brought its own health concerns. Hernia attacks were a particular problem, and in May of 1925 she suffered a serious one; two days later she rose from her bed against medical advice and was immediately felled by a stroke. She died within a few hours.</p>
         <p>Ada Dwyer Russell edited a trio of posthumous collections of Lowell's verse, including <title render="italic">What's O'Clock</title>--which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1926--<title render="italic">East Wind,</title> and <title render="italic">Ballads for Sale.</title>

         <p>The Papers of Amy Lowell consist chiefly of correspondence; the single literary manuscript is an autograph quotation from the poem, "To A Friend."  The correspondence is largely to Lowell's friends and publishers.  Many letters are to Mr. Frederick Marsh, her editor at MacMillan Publishing Company, and his wife.  There are numerous letters from Lowell to Abbie Farwell Brown, a writer and poet.  Other correspondents include S. Foster Damon, author of <title render="italic">Amy Lowell: A Chronicle.</title>

                  <p>Lowell tells about her time at Waco.  Very hot, she mentions how everyone received their degrees "with the perspiration rolling in streams off our faces."  She also talks about how she was made an honorary member of the "New York Delta of the Phi Beta Kappa Society."  Lowell laughs because had she ever gone to college, she would "have stood at the tail-end" of her class.  She sold "Many Swans" to the "North American Review."  Finally Lowell states that another operation "looms" in the future for her. The doctor was successful in scaring her from doing anything.  She then reminisces about how wonderful it was to be young and healthy.

                  <p>Happy to hear that Marsh is back in the publishing business, as he is a first class man.  Wishes she could have interaction with Harpers, but is "extremely well situated" at Houghton Mifflin.  Discusses the success of "Legends," Tendencies," and "Sword Blades."   Looking forward to seeing the Marsh's next time she is in New York.  Mr. Marsh, according to Lowell, made her time at Macmillan's extremely worthwhile: "I have no word to express my gratitude."  With two typed copies.

                  <p>Lowell chooses Sandburg for her speech at the Public Library.  Debates over the best date for her lecture.  Humorously comments about how she and Abbie are the only two women lecturing with the men:  "we are the only two worthy to join with masculine youth, which is comforting.  Ha! Ha!"  Laments that she will never appreciate the country like Abbie.  Still working on Keats.

                  <p>Sadly writes about the death of Moira O'Connor, who had a "very uncommon and terrible disease...'lymphatic leucamia,'...an incurable disease."  Discusses the difficulty and grief of Grace, Moira's mother.  Funeral is mentioned.  Likes Abbie's poems in the "Peterborough Anthology."  Keats progressing "with the heavy stump of an icthyosaurus."  She finishes by saying, "I wish I could lie on my back and look at the sun, or go swimming in the salt, salt sea, or do anything but gaze at white paper and move a pencil around."

                  <p>Informs Dr. Guthrie that she only must rest before she gives her lecture series in England, of which she is working very hard.  Because of these circumstances, Lowell cannot do anything for Dr. Guthrie.  She then offers extensive explanation about the role of the church, and while she does "not desire it" or "need it," still "others do need it...."  Furthermore, Lowell believes that Guthrie's theories should not be expressed "within the four walls of a church," and feels that she is not the proper person to help his theory along.  Lowell ends by saying that although she admires Guthrie, she still does not agree with him.
