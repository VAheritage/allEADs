         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>Wilson writes to Dabney, his former University of Virginia
         classmate (and later history professor at the University)
         regarding his life after ill health forced him to discontinue
         his studies.</p>
         <p>Of interest are twenty letters, 1881-1889, written after
         Wilson left the University of Virginia. In them he discusses
         his law studies, health, the University, the Jefferson
         Society, fellow students including future University of
         Virginia professor Charles Kent, impressions of Johns Hopkins
         and Bryn Mawr, his early writings, marriage, history, and
         politics. Later letters are shorter and more conventional in
         content, but contain occasional allusions to public affairs
         and the presidency.</p>
         <p>The collection also contains one letter from Wilson to the
         University of Virginia Board of Visitors recommending the
         hiring of Dabney as a professor.</p>
         <p>In addition to the letters from Wilson, the collection
         contains letters or telegrams from Ellen A. Wilson, Edith
         Bolling Wilson, Newton Baker, John Randolph Bolling, A. S.
         Burleson, Assistant Secretary of State William Phillips,
         Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, William Howard Taft, J. P.
         Tumulty and the Italian ambassador. Most of these letters
         concern issues that Dabney brought to Wilson's attention.</p>

               Wilson's return to Wilmington after leaving the
               University of Virginia because of health reasons.
               Mentions he is still studying law. Wilson also inquires
               about various former classmates, including future
               University of Virginia professor Charles "Chucky" Kent,
               and about events since his departure from his
               fraternity. The letter is signed "T. Woodrow Wilson."

               from the University of Virginia. Wilson describes his
               attempts at "courting" local girls. Wilson mentions that
               he is still recovering from his "stomach" illness. He
               writes of a book he is reading ( 
               <title render="italic">Early History of Charles James
               Fox</title>by George Otto Trevelyan) and highly
               recommends to Dabney that he read it also. Wilson
               mentions he is still studying his law books and requests
               that Dabney write back with news and "gossip" from the
               University.</p>

               having answered it sooner. Much of the letter contains
               questions about various situations at the University of
               Virginia and his fraternity. Wilson also mentions that
               Wilmington has "no schools here of any worth at all,"
               and that he is now instructing his younger brother in
               Latin; his brother is being taught at home because of
               the lack of good schools. Wilson mentions that he is
               reading (in Latin) 
               <title render="italic">The Life of Cicero</title>.
               Wilson also mentions the newspaper's account of the
               death of Beaconsfield and says that Beaconsfield's
               "scheming" has come to an end with his death. The letter

               <persname normal="Washington Society">Wash[ington

               winner of the Oratorical Contest winner, calling him a
               "greasy junk-shop Jew." The letter also describes the
               lack of entertainment in Wilmington except for wedding
               receptions. Wilson contemplates how long he will wait
               before he "risks his fortunes" and ventures into
               marriage. He inquires about Dabney's studies. The letter

               <p>From Wilson, Atlanta, Georgia, to Dabney in Munich,
               Germany. Wilson asks about Dabney's studies in Germany
               and the whereabouts of former University of Virginia
               students. Wilson tells Dabney that he has spoken before
               the Tariff Commission. He says he would like to start a
               group in Georgia, called the "Georgia House of Commons,"
               but for now will be organizing a "Free Trade" group
               there. Wilson says that young attorneys have a hard time
               in Georgia because older lawyers are "unscrupulous" in
               their practice making it difficult for younger attorneys
               to get started. The letter is signed "Woodrow
               Wilson."</p>

               <p>From Wilson, Atlanta, Georgia, to Dabney in Munich,
               Germany. Wilson acknowledges receipt of Dabney's letter
               and says that he envies Dabney studying in the "old
               world" while he is buried in the hum-drum life in "slow,
               ignorant and uninteresting Georgia." Wilson talks about
               practicing law in Georgia, and the lack of intellectual
               companionship he has found there. Wilson hopes to study
               at Johns Hopkins University. Wilson talks of the
               election of a new Georgia Governor due to the death of
               Governor, 
               <persname normal="Alexander Hamilton">Alex[ander
               Hamilton]</persname>Stephens. He says that Georgia is
               too thrifty to have a Lieutenant Governor, and that
               while the expense of the legislative session and special
               election would have cost more than a Lieutenant
               Governor, the people of Georgia are happier thinking
               that they have saved money. Wilson says that Tennessee
               offered to send Georgia a candidate to run for governor
               because Georgia did not have anyone worthy of running.
               Wilson says the new governor is unremarkable except that
               he is honest, which Wilson says is rare for politicians.
               Wilson says the new governor has a speech impediment,
               stuttering, that makes it hard for him to talk; he
               quotes someone as saying that they have traded a
               governor who could not walk for a governor who could not
               talk. Wilson describes the temporary capital in Atlanta
               as ugly. If he is not accepted at Johns Hopkins he will
               go to Baltimore anyway and spend time in that
               "beautiful" city's libraries. The letter is signed
               "Woodrow Wilson."</p>

               <p>From Wilson, Baltimore, Maryland, to Dabney in
               Berlin, Germany. Wilson writes that he had received
               Dabney's letter two months previously even though it had
               been written in July, and had gone through many "notable
               wanderings" before it reached Wilson. Wilson explains to
               Dabney that he has moved since the letter was written.
               He says that he was denied the Fellowship at Johns
               Hopkins that he wanted, but was admitted as a graduate
               student. Even though Johns Hopkins is the best place for
               study at the time, he is disappointed with the school
               and his professors. He says that if his knowledge of
               German were better, he would move to be with and study
               with Dabney in Germany. Wilson also announces to Dabney
               that he has met, fallen in love with, and become engaged
               to Ellen Louise Axson, the daughter and granddaughter of
               a minister. He says she is very intelligent, well read,
               and "the most domestic of maidens." He notes that she
               has worked as a portrait painter. Wilson talks of his
               desire to become a professor, but fears it will be at a
               school in the West or South, because the job market for
               professors in the East is difficult. He has not heard
               from his former classmates from the University of
               Virginia and inquires if Dabney has heard from any of
               them. Wilson asks Dabney to notice that he has dropped
               the "T." from his signature. The letter is signed
               "Woodrow Wilson." Notes on envelope appear to be in
               Dabney's hand and read "Answered on May 6th 1884 about
               his engagement to be married."</p>

               <p>From Wilson, Baltimore, Maryland, to Dabney in
               Berlin. Wilson apologizes for the lack of
               correspondence. Wilson explains that he has not only
               been made a fellow at Johns Hopkins, but has written a
               book entitled 
               <title render="italic">Congressional Government: A Study
               in American Politics</title>. He is more content with
               Johns Hopkins than he was in the beginning. He has
               accepted a job that involves setting up the history
               department at the newly-established Bryn Mawr School. He
               says that he could not refuse the job as it offered a
               good starting salary and was near the civilized part of
               the country and good libraries. He mentions his upcoming
               wedding in June, and offers to introduce Dabney to the
               new Mrs. Wilson when he returns from Germany. He
               inquires about University of Virginia friends and refers
               to Dabney as having an "Old West Range Heart." The
               closing is "your Loving Friend," and the letter is
               signed "Woodrow Wilson." Envelope has a forwarding
               correction to Heidelberg in blue and a pencil notation
               that reads, "Answered Oct 19 1885."</p>

               <p>From Wilson, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, to Dabney in
               Bloomington, Indiana. Wilson apologizes for having not
               written sooner, but explains that Mrs. "W" has been ill.
               Wilson tells Dabney he is glad to have him back on this
               continent again, and he feels like he has him back on
               the East Range again [there is an autograph note by
               Dabney stating that Wilson meant "West Range"]. Wilson
               thanks Dabney for his comments on Wilson's book 
               <title render="italic">Congressional
               Government</title>and is assured that Dabney's kind
               comments are genuine. A large portion of the letter
               concerns Wilson's happiness since marriage; he describes
               it as "rhapsody." Wilson congratulates Dabney on having
               received his Ph.D. in Germany and assures him of its
               value, and says that he will look out for a job for
               Dabney. He says that it may be difficult as schools are
               teaching history in "shamefully small numbers." He ends
               by saying that the girls at Bryn Mawr are interested and
               intelligent. The letter is signed "Your Very Sincere
               Friend Woodrow Wilson." The envelope has the date 18 Dec
               1887 pencilled on and is postmarked Dec. 10 Bryn

               <p>From Wilson, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania to Dabney.
               Wilson is concerned with Dabney's situation at the
               school in which he is teaching. He has not written for
               many reasons, one of which is that his baby has been
               sick. Wilson has been to Cornell to give a lecture and
               while there visited a fraternity house and spoke to a
               "brother" who confirmed the situation in Bloomington was
               as Dabney had written. There is discussion of his
               teaching methods - "whether that truth be on the side of
               Webster or of Calhoun." Wilson says that he has an even
               greater concern since it was he who "advanced his
               candidacy" for the job at Indiana University. He asks
               Dabney to write him more about it. Wilson then writes of
               a Wilmington editor who did not respond to a letter
               written to him to go along with a "notice" he had
               written for the paper on "Don Miff." Wilson says that he
               does not know if the editor even published the piece,
               but hopes the editor would "play gentleman for once."
               The remainder of the letter is chiefly about Dabney's
               opinion of Wilson's moving to Berlin for one to two
               years. The purpose would be to both learn German and to
               have some "Leisure time." He inquires how much could he
               expect to pay for two people and a baby and possible a
               nurse to live in comfort without a "peppercorn's" regard
               to style. He asks for Dabney's "whole" opinion. Wilson
               would like to go now while he is young and his learning
               abilities are at their best. He asks for Dabney's candid
               answer. The letter has a P.S. that sends Mrs. Wilson's
               warm regards and asks for [Charles?] Kent's address. The
               letter is signed "your sincere friend, Woodrow Wilson."
               The envelope has the date 1886 pencilled on.</p>

               <p>From Wilson, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, to Dabney at
               Indiana University. Wilson describes a teaching position
               that is open at and suggests that Dabney come teach at
               Bryn Mawr. He states that the cost of lodging will be $7
               per week. This is for a third floor room, which Wilson
               feels is just as nice as the more expensive rooms on the
               first or second floor. Wilson says that if he and Mrs.
               Wilson are still keeping house the next year, they would
               invite him to take a room with them. The salary of $600
               a year may be $400 less than Dabney makes in Indiana,
               but that it is higher than some of the new professors
               will be getting and Wilson says that there will be a
               good potential for salary advancement. He says the
               Quakers who operate the school are cautious and never
               promise anything, but do as they have means. Wilson says
               that the region around Philadelphia is good for those
               who have an interest in history. Wilson writes that he
               is trying to be careful in suggesting Dabney move
               because Wilson is unsure if it would be for selfish or
               unselfish reasons that he would make the suggestion. He
               describes the Bryn Mawr classes as intelligent and the
               administration as honest and straightforward. The letter
               concludes with warm regards from Mrs. Wilson and is
               signed "Your Affectionate Friend, Woodrow Wilson."</p>

               <p>From Wilson to Dabney. Wilson has received Dabney's
               letter announcing his engagement. Wilson tells Dabney of
               his own happiness in his marriage. He says that the good
               news of his engagement is second only to that of his
               news that Dabney might be getting a teaching position at
               the University of Virginia. Wilson writes that he "loves
               that old place" and the faculty is the most influential
               in the South. Wilson is resigned to the fact the Dabney
               will not come to Bryn Mawr to teach as his assistant,
               but does increase his offer of salary to $850 the first
               year and $1000 the next. He says that the choice of an
               assistant is up to him, and while he can't really wait
               until Dabney finds out if he will be teaching at the
               University of Virginia, he says it very well might be
               June when he makes his decision. The letter is signed
               "With love as ever Your Sincere Friend, Woodrow Wilson."
               The envelope has the date 17 Feb. 1887 pencilled on.</p>

               <p>From Wilson to Dabney at the University of Indiana.
               Wilson has been thinking of Dabney often, but was in a
               small Georgia town for the summer and so out of touch.
               He was also preparing to lecture at Johns Hopkins as
               well as preparing for his work at Bryn Mawr. For these
               reasons, he has failed to write to Dabney. Wilson
               acknowledges receipt of Dabney's "Memorials of a
               Southern Planter" about his grandfather. Mrs. Wilson has
               also read it and they enjoy the "retelling of its
               contents." Wilson praises Dabney's grandfather and says
               that he fears this country will never see another such
               man again. Wilson says all of the North should read this
               book. Wilson says if there were more people like
               Dabney's grandfather there would be no "labour" problems
               because his "conscience was the only kind of arbitrator
               between master and workman that will ever bring peace
               and cooperative friendship." The remainder of the letter
               is information trying to persuade Dabney to come teach
               at Bryn Mawr. Wilson has increased the salary offer to
               $1200 or possibly $1500 since the area is expensive to
               live in. Wilson also writes that the area is ideal for
               those studying history because of the libraries and
               such. He ends by inviting Dabney to visit during the
               holidays. The letter is signed "Your all-the-time chum,
               Woodrow Wilson." The envelope does not appear to belong
               to this letter. It is addressed to Dabney at a New York
               address and is postmarked 1885. It also has pencilled
               notes which read "answered Jan'y 11th 1888" at the top
               and in pencil on the bottom portion is written
               "Something about his marriage." Also in pencil but in
               what appears to be a different handwriting is the words
               "this seems to be in the wrong envelope" and a date of
               28 Oct. 1885 that has been scratched over in pencil.</p>

               <p>From Wilson, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, to Dabney in

               "things have been at a stand still" regarding the
               teaching position at Bryn Mawr. Wilson addresses
               Dabney's concern about whether or not he would be able
               to break his contract at Bryn Mawr if a better offer
               came along. Wilson says a previous professor was going
               to leave, and the school gave him a raise to stay and
               the promise of no contract. Wilson tells Dabney that the
               cheapest first class housing he can find would be $16 to
               $18 dollars per week. Bryn Mawr is trying to build
               cottages to house professors and Dabney would qualify
               for them. Wilson also suggests that Dabney take a house
               in the city and pay $5 per week for car fare. Wilson
               will continue with inquiries into the matter. He
               congratulates Dabney on the book he will publish. There
               is a note added on the first page by Wilson stating that
               he was sorry Dabney did not visit them over the
               holidays. The envelope has the date "20 Jan, 1888"

               <p>From Wilson, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania to Dabney in

               negotiations to hire a professor for his assistant at
               Bryn Mawr. The salary offer has actually now decreased.
               The offer is $1100 and would require a two-year
               commitment. Wilson states that is less than what he
               received when first at Bryn Mawr and that he can not
               survive now on his $2000 per year salary, except that he
               gets $500 a year for work he does for Johns Hopkins.
               Wilson is considering leaving Bryn Mawr to seek better
               pay and to get a chair teaching public law "or the like"
               somewhere else. Wilson mentions now having two babies.
               He thanks Dabney for the copy of his book and promises

               <p>From Wilson, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, to Dabney in
               Bloomington, Indiana. Wilson apologizes for not writing
               sooner, but explains that he has been busy with work and
               the death of his mother. Wilson writes that his mother's
               death was sudden and the only news he had of her illness
               was the notice that she was dead. He says he went to
               Tennessee to be with his father for as long as his job
               would allow. Wilson says his father will be alone since
               Wilson's sisters are all married and his brother is in
               college. Wilson says her death makes him feel like his
               youth has also died. He praises Dabney for a piece that
               he has written to the "University Bulletin." Wilson begs
               Dabney to please make time to visit him over the summer.
               The letter is signed "Yrs. Affectionately, Woodrow
               Wilson." The envelope has " 16 May 1888 about his
               mother's death" pencilled on.</p>

               <p>Wilson, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, to Dabney in
               Bloomington, Indiana. Wilson was glad to receive
               Dabney's letter of the 22nd. He congratulates Dabney on
               the announcement of his engagement and his upcoming
               marriage on June 19. The remainder of the letter is
               filled with Wilson's praise for marriage. Wilson
               compares his life before and after marriage, and
               strongly suggests marriage as a good thing for his
               friend Dabney. The letter ends by Wilson writing that he
               would like to have Dabney and Miss Butler spend their
               wedding trip in Bryn Mawr. The letter is signed "Mrs.
               and Mr. Woodrow Wilson." The envelope has "about
               marriage" pencilled on.</p>

               Dabney regarding the loss of his baby. Wilson writes
               that being back at the University of Virginia must give
               Dabney some comfort, as it is so familiar. Wilson asks
               that Dabney write him with details of his work. Wilson
               also asks about the textbook that he sent to Dabney.
               Wilson closes with messages of friendship and sympathy
               from him and Mrs. Wilson. It is signed "Your

               but explains his writing pen is elsewhere. Wilson thanks
               Dabney for the review of his book. Wilson writes a great
               deal about his friendship with Dabney and what it has
               meant to him. Wilson closes by urging Dabney to come to

               letter and thanks him for his kind words regarding
               Dabney's visit to Princeton. Wilson comments on the
               selection of a new president for the University of

               University, he would only suggest the very best man for

               man at this time, but will write Dabney should someone
               come to mind for the position. The letter ends with

               <p>Wilson, Princeton, New Jersey, to Dabney in
               Charlottesville, Virginia. Wilson writes that the
               presidency of the University of Virginia has been
               offered to him three times. He never gave any indication
               that he would accept the position. Wilson says that
               Dabney is at perfect liberty to state the "whole case"
               to anyone. Wilson says that he was unaware of any
               opposition to him as president, just opposition to
               having any president at all, but that if they must have
               a president, the "opposition" would agree to Wilson.
               Wilson writes that he still does not know of anyone that
               he could strongly recommend for the position. The letter
               closes with regret that Dabney has been distressed by a
               "cock and bull" story. The typed closing reads
               "Cordially and Faithfully yours," and the letter is
               signed "Woodrow Wilson."</p>

               situation there makes it difficult not to do so. Wilson
               writes that he would like to see Dabney, and that being
               with Dabney makes Wilson feel like a boy again. The
               typed closing reads "affectionately yours" and the

               initiative, referendum and recall when they were
               together so Wilson says it would be worthwhile for him
               to "summarize" it somewhat more formally. The remainder
               of the letter is Wilson's summarization. The closing
               reads "Faithfully Yours, Woodrow Wilson. On the
               photostat of the envelope, there is a note in Dabney's
               hand that reads "16 Nov., 1911 I had this letter

               Trenton, New Jersey, to Dabney in Charlottesville,
               Virginia. Wilson acknowledges Dabney's letter of
               December 21 and thanks Dabney for what he is doing and
               the "value of what you are telling me from time to
               time." Wilson mentions making a series of speeches in
               Virginia, and suggests that Dabney is in a better
               position to judge if the Virginia legislature should
               invite him to do so. Wilson says that the letter Dabney
               amended has been well received by Wilson's New York
               headquarters. The typed closing reads "Faithfully
               yours," and the letter is signed "Woodrow Wilson."</p>

               enclosures. Wilson mentions that he has received an
               answer to a letter from Archie Patterson. Wilson says
               that he is willing to come to Richmond to speak after
               February. The typed closing reads "Always faithfully

               and how [Robert M.] LaFollette is regarded. Wilson says

               but explains that he knows Dabney will understand why.
               Wilson acknowledges Dabney's letters. Wilson says that
               his days are "one continual absorbing rush." Wilson
               mentions the response in Virginia to the

               <p>Ellen Wilson, New Jersey, to Dabney in
               Charlottesville, Virginia. Mrs. Wilson sends more
               details of the "Carnegie pension affair." Most of the
               letter describes who is eligible for the pension, and
               the requirements thereof. She writes concerning Woodrow
               Wilson's financial situations, his lack of income since
               leaving Princeton, and the costs he has incurred doing
               "public service." She says that she supposes he could
               take a "paying" job, but that would force him to give up
               his leadership in the reform movement. Mrs. Wilson
               writes that he only receives $1000 a year from his
               books, and that goes to pay for "life insurances." Mrs.
               Wilson writes that when Wilson applied for the Carnegie
               pension he had not been elected governor, and had no
               means of support. She trusts Dabney's discretion in the
               matter: "I don't know what he would do to me if he knew
               I was writing all this." The closing is "Yours very
               cordially," and the letter is signed "Ellen A. Wilson."
               The envelope has "From Mrs. Woodrow Wilson" and "Feb. 9

               Virginia. Wilson assures Dabney that he has not suffered
               a reported breakdown, only a severe cold. Wilson also
               expresses concerns that Dabney has had "nerve" trouble
               and has been unable to sleep. He says that he thinks
               Dabney's intention to go to the "other side of the
               water" to recuperate is a good idea. Wilson reports that
               things politically are in good shape. Wilson is
               disappointed in the small numbers of people who have
               voted in the primaries and he thinks the "purpose" to
               nominate him is as strong as ever. The letter ends with
               Wilson mentioning that he saw Dick Byrd and Mr. Byrd was
               hopeful that the "Virginia situation" would be
               controlled in Wilson's favor. The typed closing reads,

               change of address that Dabney gave in his last letter.
               Wilson fears that his last letter is "wandering" around
               Europe seeking Dabney. Wilson mentions that Dabney has
               had troubles and political disappointments in Virginia.
               Wilson also mentions that results in Baltimore should
               cheer Dabney. Wilson concludes that he has "piles" of
               letters and cannot write more then a few lines. The

               like to visit the University of Virginia when he comes
               to Staunton, but with as little ceremony as possible.
               Wilson says that he loves the University of Virginia for
               its "simplicities" and not for the trouble he has gotten
               into. Wilson says that he is settled in Bermuda for a
               little period and hopes to come back with new zest and
               refreshment. The typed closing on letter one reads
               "Faithfully yours" and the letter is signed "Woodrow
               Wilson." A second letter of the same date is about
               Dabney's letter regarding Randolph Harrison. Wilson ends

               <p>Wilson, Bermuda, to Dabney in Charlottesville,
               Virginia. Wilson says he understands perfectly Dabney's
               actions regarding office appointment recommendations.
               Wilson will only be able to spend a few hours in
               Charlottesville. He is struggling with masses of
               correspondence, even "down here." The typed closing
               reads "Affectionately yours" and the letter is signed
               "Woodrow Wilson." The envelope has "Bermuda Dec. 3 1912"
               written on it.</p>

               <p>Wilson, Trenton, New Jersey, to Dabney in
               Charlottesville, Virginia. Wilson thanks Dabney for
               sending Tucker's letter. Wilson mentions a business
               failure connected with him at the Jamestown Exposition.
               Wilson adds that it was a joy to see Dabney. Wilson
               mentions Dabney's nose "trouble" and says that he
               thought Dabney did not look well. Wilson says the trip
               to Staunton did him no harm, but he came back feeling
               better that when he started. Wilson says that there had
               been some suggestion, perhaps in the 
               <title render="italic">[Richmond]
               Times-Dispatch</title>, that it was not in "good taste"
               to give a talk to the machine men in Virginia. Wilson
               hopes this is not the general impression. Wilson writes
               that his friends will have to get used to his way of
               always having a dart for somebody. Wilson writes that
               his passage was on the spur of the moment. The typed
               closing reads "Affectionately yours," and the letter is
               signed "Woodrow Wilson."</p>

               office to the Postmaster General and encloses the
               Postmaster General's response. The Postmaster General
               writes that at the "instance" of Virginia Senators, the
               Governor of Virginia and a Virginia Representative, any
               change to the mail service has been postponed. He will
               look in to the taking the best action for the Brook Hill
               post office.</p>

               requested Lieutenant Roselli be allowed to remain in the
               United States for two additional weeks. The Ambassador
               reported that Roselli had been recalled not because he
               had offended Americans, but because Italy needed
               officers in light of the great numbers that had been
               killed. Phillips also states that the Ambassador would,
               in light of the request, extend Roselli's visit for two
               weeks, and has telegraphed permission to Roselli. The
               Italian Ambassador writes that he has already taken
               steps to arrange for Roselli's visit to be extended.</p>
