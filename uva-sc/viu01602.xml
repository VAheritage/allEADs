      <p>Morbio was a graduate of the California School of
         Mechanical Arts (1908) and a Mechanical Engineering graduate
         of Cornell University (1913), with a Certificate in Electrical
         Engineering. After graduation, he worked for the Engineering
         Department of the Panama-Pacific Exposition for a year, and
         then went to work for the Great Western Power Company for two
         years in charge of Industrial and Domestic Electric Heating
         Department for the San Francisco District. At the time Morbio
         entered the service, he was in business for himself in
         building construction.</p>

    <scopecontent>
      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The earliest part of this collection consists of a
         handwritten carbon letterbook kept by Adolph Morbio, a member
         of Company "B", 115th Engineers, Pioneer Regiment, while
         stationed at the Second Engineer Officer Training Camp,
         Vancouver Barracks, Washington, from September 6, 1917, until
         the camp closed on November 27, 1917. Morbio had transferred
         to Vancouver from Camp Kearny, located about seventeen miles
         from San Diego, California, and begins his correspondence with
         a description of the camp and its routine to his sister on
         September 6.</p>
      <p>The letters in the letterbook are chiefly written to his
         family and friends but do include a few letters concerning
         bills and business affairs. All of the letters emphasize the
         rigorous and tight training schedule of the camp created to
         produce engineering officers capable of serving with the
         Infantry on the front lines or as staff officers depending on
         the need.</p>
      <p>Subjects in the letterbook include: a typical schedule, the
         probability of being assigned to an Infantry Regiment,
         vaccinations, and his regret that his brother, Carlo Morbio,
         is going with a machine gun company (Sep 9); his lack of free
         time (Sep 9); his experiences in drilling his men, the hikes
         and training (Sep 13); list of the seventeen volumes he has to
         master for his formal exams to become an officer and his fears
         in drilling his company (Sep 15); he holds the provisional
         commission of a West Point cadet (Sep 16); his progress in
         training, his difficulty with the semaphore classes, and the
         practice skirmish which was extremely physically demanding
         (Sep 22); the soldiers feel ignored by the people of Portland
         and Vancouver (Sep 25); Portland finally furnishes some
         entertainment for the soldiers at the Hotel Multnomah (Sep 30
         &amp; Oct 3); his study of mapping, infantry drill, and his
         experiences drilling his company (Oct 7); new work of making
         brush mats for the walls of trenches, drilling on the Columbia
         River in pontoon boats, and cutting brush with large Bowie
         knives (Oct 9); learning knots and hitches for bridge
         construction, his participation in the mock battle near a
         cornfield, involving the capture of barns, wood piles, etc.
         without prior explanation to the farmers (Oct 14); comments
         concerning army regulations, "Army Regulations is quite a
         volume and we have gone over it quite thoroughly. It
         prescribes and prohibits everything that everybody in the Army
         has been able to think of since the time of George Washington"
         (Oct 18); his work at the shooting range (Nov 5, 6, &amp; 7);
         a dance in Portland and his stay at the hotel (Nov 11); and
         news that the Vancouver Barracks are to close on November 27th
         when he will come home on leave for a few days (Nov 14).</p>
      <p>The rest of the collection consists of about 115 carbon
         copies (with some duplication), 1917-1919, of Morbio's letters
         to family and friends just prior to his departure overseas and
         during his tour of duty supervising the construction of
         electrical installations at Tours, France. Subjects in these
         letters include: the purchase of a Corona typewriter for
         Christmas to take with him overseas and his visit to the
         residential areas of Los Angeles (1917 Dec 25); and his
         explanation that the 115th Regiment of Engineers is a National
         Guard Unit of Pioneer Troops that goes ahead to build advance
         railroad lines and other preliminary work, his present work as
         the 2nd Platoon Leader, his scare concerning a soldier who
         experienced an epileptic seizure while under his command in
         the desert where they were attempting to assemble a railroad
         trestle, and the location of Camp Kearny about 17 miles from
         San Diego on a flat plain in the desert (1917 Dec 31).</p>
      <p>Morbio begins his letters of 1918 with the news that he has
         contracted the German measles and must remain in isolation for
         two weeks at the Base Hospital (Jan 2 &amp; 5); describes a
         brief "escape" from hospital quarantine to La Jolla without
         leave (Jan 6); includes "Beating the Submarines" (1918 Jan)
         which describes his trip overseas from New York to England on

         finally received mail from home and is busy with electrical
         work which consists of "getting power, designing, installing,
         and purchasing materials for wiring, and installing electrical
         apparatus" (Mar 7); and describes his earlier stay at the
         English and French "Rest Camps" and the trip over to France
         (Mar 10).</p>
