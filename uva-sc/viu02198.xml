          <p>James Barbour (1775-1842) was elected Speaker of the
               House of Delegates of Virginia in 1809 and remained in
               this post until his election as Governor of Virginia in
               1812. In 1815, Barbour was elected to the United States
               Senate, and he served as a senator until 1825 when he
               was appointed to the cabinet. He remained on the cabinet
               until 1828 when he requested the position of minister to
               Great Britain. He remained in Britain until 1829. When
               he returned to the United States, he attempted to get
               back into Virginia politics, but was not very
               successful. He was not very active in politics
               hereafter, and he spent most of his time at his home in
               Barboursville.</p>

          <p>This letter to David Allen was written during his

               he owns and would like for Allen to see. Some of these
               horses are imported, and of fine stock. Barbour hopes to
               interest Allen in purchasing one of his studs as Allen
               owns a large stock of mares. He offers to send one of
               the studs to Allen to "try him for a season at the end
               thereof if you like buy him, if not return him with such

          <p>Richard Harding Davis (1864-1916), the son of Rebecca
               Harding Davis, was both a prominent journalist and
               author. He began his career as a journalist in 1886 with

               gained prominence as a journalist, in part, because of
               his reporting on six prominent wars: the Spanish War in
               Cuba; the Graeco-Turkish War; the Spanish- American War;
               the Boer War, the Russo-Japanese War, and World War I.

               time in England with Seymour and Ella. He also mentions

          <p>In this letter to Astor, Harte asks him to recall a
               conversation in which he and Astor discussed the
               possibility of Astor finding him a "position". Because
               Harte has been ill, he has not been able to write very
               much recently, and therefore, he really needs a job.</p>

          <p>John Singleton Mosby (1833-1916) lived near

               University of Virginia in 1849. Later on he was admitted
               to the bar in Bristol , Va., and he practised law until
               the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, at which time he
               enlisted in the cavalry. Mosby participated in the Bull
               Run campaign, and he was a Confederate Ranger. After the
               war, he practised law in Virginia. In 1878 he was
               appointed consul at Hong Kong, where he remained until
               1885. In 1887, he published

               inquiry about his injuries in a battle near Fairfax
               Court House, Virginia on August 17, 1863. Mosby replies
               that he did not remember the exact date, but he was shot
               twice and severely wounded. "My own surgeon did not
               consider the would mortal but it was so reported at the
               time." He mentions other wounds suffered in later
               battles, and that his son in Denver has the memoir of
               his command should Peck want further details.</p>
