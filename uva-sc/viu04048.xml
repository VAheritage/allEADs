      <p>This collection contains appeals, complaints, correspondence, and other papers,
                1847-1848, 23 items, in the case of the Reverend John Skinner, put on trial
                by Presbytery of Lexington on the charge of libel and defamation against the
                President and Professors of Washington College, three of whom are in the ministry
                with him, in a pamphlet written by Dr. Skinner.</p>
      <p>In the pamphlet (not present), he accused the President and Professors of
                participating in producing dissatisfaction with his ministry (pages 76-77); treating
                the students publicly with contempt; acting as police and "spying through key
                holes"; professors being very jealous of their authority; said the professors feared
                Dr. Skinner coming to examine their classes; states that the college dignitaries
                have a disposition to inflict their wrath on students who wrote a letter of sympathy
                for Skinner (page 80); accused the President and professors of Washington College of
                acting to prevent the address of the Rev. Dr. Alexander, who had come by
                appointment, to the student body (pages 83-84); wrote very specific accusations
                against his fellow ministers, Rev. Ruffner, Rev. Calhoun, and Rev. Armstrong (pages
                81-90), which included the approval of dancing, statements that Washington College
                was not a Presbyterian College, interfering with his ministry, and communing with
                Episcopalians, latitudinarianism, among other complaints; and accusing Major J.T.L.
                Preston (page 65), an elder in the church of Lexington, of unsound doctrine.</p>
      <p>The Reverend John Skinner, according to the charges, wrote about himself, "I am a
                Presbyterian minister of Scottish caliber &amp; I have been set &amp; appointed as
                sentinel at the gates of the Presbyterian Church here; &amp; since you &amp; your
                other Presbyterian Professors have playing such 'fantastic tricks before high
                heaven' in my absence - I am determined just to keep a more vigilant watch in
                future." For more details see the manuscript Copy of Charges &amp; Specifications
                exhibited against Dr. John Skinner, February 4-March 22, [1848], and the printed
                items in Rare Books, including: <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Case of the Rev.
