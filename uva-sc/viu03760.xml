      <p>Dr. Edward E. Younger, a distinguished member of the
         University of Virginia, faculty for over thirty years, was
         born in Pindall, Arkansas on 29 June 1909. He received his
         B.A. degree from Arkansas State Teachers College, an M.A. from
         Oklahoma State University, and a Ph.D. from George Washington
         University.</p>
      <p>He taught in public schools in Arkansas and Oklahoma and at
         Oklahoma State University, George Washington University,
         Turner's Diplomatic School, the United States Naval War
         College, Allahabad University (India), and the University of
         Virginia, where he was appointed assistant professor in 1946,
         associate professor in 1949, full professor in 1956, and
         professor emeritus in 1974. During the Second World War he
         served with the United States Navy as a lieutenant commander
         in the aviation branch.</p>
      <p>In 1957-1958, he was Fulbright Professor of American
         History and Politics at Allahabad University in India. In
         addition to teaching classes there, he travelled and lectured
         extensively in India on American history and foreign policy.
         During this period of eleven weeks, he travelled thirteen
         thousand miles in India and Nepal and addressed seventy-six
         different audiences.</p>
      <p>One of his books, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">John A. Kasson: Politics and Diplomacy
         from Lincoln to McKinley</title>, a biography of an American
         diplomat, won the Phi Beta Kappa prize in 1955. Another book, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Inside the Confederate
         Government</title>, the diary of the head of the Confederate
         Bureau of War, was selected as the Book-of-the-Month by the
         Civil War Book Club in May 1957.</p>
      <p>At the University of Virginia, in addition to being
         professor of history, chairman of the department, director of
         Student Aid and Placement, foreign student advisor, chairman
         of the Wilson Gee Institute for Faculty Research in the Social
         Sciences, Director of Graduate Studies for the History
         Department, dean of the Graduate School, and director of
         numerous graduate dissertations and theses, Younger did much
         by way of department building. He was responsible for the
         development of the department's responsibilities for the field
         of U.S. History since 1861. As a means of providing outlets
         and contacts for graduate students, he led the movement to
         organize the History Club, initiated the alumni party and
         breakfast held yearly at the meeting of the Southern
         Historical Association, launched the student-edited 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Essays in History</title>. As
         department chairman, Younger procured $250,000 from the
         Danforth Foundation for a four-year Ph.D. program; $150,000
         from the Ford Foundation to develop Asian studies in Virginia
         colleges and universities; numerous Woodrow Wilson
         Fellowships; several NDEA Fellowships; and NEDA Summer
         Institutes for Teachers. Within five years the graduate
         enrollment in history had increased from fifty-five to some
         two hundred students. During the same time Younger enlarged
         the history faculty from twelve to twenty-two full time
         persons with professional rank. This expansion, (which by 1976
         had produced a faculty of forty-five), was well advanced when
         Younger was appointed dean of the Graduate School.</p>
      <p>In addition to these administrative duties, Younger
         directed some 130 M.A. theses and approximately sixty-five
         dissertations. Almost one-third of the dissertations have been
         published as full-length books. Many of these studies dealt
         with aspects of Virginia history since 1861, and Younger came
         to be recognized as the leading scholar of Virginia history
         since 1865, a reputation honored by the Virginia Historical
         Society when it conferred upon him in 1973 on Honorary Life
         Membership.</p>
      <p>Throughout his career at the University of Virginia,
         Younger kept professionally active, attending history
         meetings, participating in scholarly programs, serving on
         committees and as an officer in professional associations,
         publishing articles, and reviewing books. Younger believed he
         made his greatest scholarly contribution through the
         influences he exerted upon his students. Within the University
         of Virginia he was conspicuously effective as a leader of
         students and as a builder of the strong, contemporary History
         Department.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Edward E. Younger papers consist of ca. 38,500 items
         (77 Hollinger boxes, 32 shelf feet) covering the years
         1937-1979. The collection is divided into the following nine
         series: 1) Younger manuscripts and related material, 2)
         personal papers, 3) general correspondence, 4) history
         department papers, 5) papers relating to the University of
         Virginia, 6) student academic papers, 7) photographs, 8)
         student subject files, and 9) tape recordings. There is also a
         folder of oversize material. The first two series reflect
         Younger's personal research, his memberships in professional
         organizations, and his work in India and at the Naval War
         College. The remaining series deal chiefly with his roles as
         professor of history, chairman of the history department, dean
         of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and member of
         various committees at the University of Virginia. Information
         on Younger's career can be found in the folder of
         "Biographical and Professional Information" in box 17.</p>
      <p>The first series (16 Hollinger boxes) consists of typed and
         holograph manuscripts, page proofs of Younger's books,
         correspondence concerning these projects, articles, book
         reviews, lectures, and research notes. Younger's first book
         was 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">John A. Kasson: Politics and Diplomacy
         from Lincoln to McKinley</title>, published by the Iowa State
         Historical Society in 1955. This biography was an expansion of
         Younger's 1942 doctoral dissertation at George Washington
         University, The 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Early Diplomatic Career of John A.
         Kasson, 1863-1885</title>. This dissertation and three
         articles which resulted from Younger's research into Kasson's
         life are also included in the collection. One of these is an
         article describing the research process. The Kasson biography
         won the Phi Beta Kappa Prize at the University of Virginia.
         Younger's second book, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Inside the Confederate Government: The
         Diary of Robert Garlick Hill Kean, Head of the Bureau of
         War</title>, was published by Oxford University Press in 1957
         and was a Civil War Book Club selection. The collection
         includes a typed transcript of Kean's diary in addition to the
         final manuscript of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Inside the Confederate
         Government</title>, edited and with an introduction by
         Younger. The original Kean diary is the property of Jefferson
         Randolph Kean, II, and is on loan in the Manuscripts
         Department of the University of Virginia Library.</p>
      <p>Younger's files on lecture dates (1940-1978) consist
         chiefly of correspondence, and only occasionally include the
         full text of a lecture. Where the title of the lecture is
         unknown, these files are identified by the year and place in
         which the lecture was given. Texts of additional lectures can
         be found under "India" and "Naval War College" in the second
         series of the collection.</p>
      <p>Material relating to two projects of which Younger was
         coordinator or chief editor have also been included in this
         series. The first of these is the Albemarle County history
         project, undertaken by the Albemarle County Historical Society
         in 1972 as a contribution to the U.S. Bicentennial. The
         Society's Book Committee, chaired by Younger, engaged John H.
         Moore to write the history. Moore's book, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Albemarle: Jefferson's County</title>,
         was published in 1976 by the University Press of Virginia, and
         it won the Award of Merit of the American Association of State
         and Local History. The collection includes typed manuscripts
         and galley proofs (oversized) for the book, as well as
         correspondence, readers' comments, and reviews. Additional
         material relating to the Albemarle County Historical Society
         of the collection. Beginning around 1967, Younger proposed
         that he edit a comprehensive history of Virginia since 1865,
         with chapters written by various students whose graduate
         research he had directed. This project was set aside around
         1970. The collection includes correspondence with
         contributors, drafts of proposed chapters, grant applications,
         and financial papers.</p>
      <p>The research material in the manuscripts series consists of
         note cards compiled by Younger for many of the above projects,
         including the Kasson biography and Moore's Albemarle
         history.</p>
      <p>The second series in this collection consists of seven
         Hollinger boxes of Younger's personal papers. These have been
         arranged in four sub-series: 1) papers re Younger's career,,
         2) papers re his year in India, 3) papers re his year at the
         Naval War College, and 4) files on professional
         organizations.</p>
      <p>The papers on Younger's career consist of biographical
         information in the form of vitae,
         résumés, and publicity. There are also
         files of material on the major events in Younger's academic
         career, including his doctorate, his appointment as Alumni
         Professor of History (1974) and his retirement (1978). In
         1957-58, Younger was a Fulbright Scholar at Allahabad
         University in India, and in 1960-61 he held the Ernest J. King
         Chair of Maritime History at the Naval War College in Newport,
         Rhode Island. Material on these two subjects consists mainly
         of correspondence, lectures, and printed material. The files
         on professional organizations are chiefly correspondence
         concerning the meetings of historical organizations to which
         Younger belonged.</p>
      <p>The third series consists of five Hollinger boxes of
         general correspondence covering the years 1944-1979. There are
         some personal letters, but most of the correspondence is
         related to Younger's positions at the University of Virginia.
         These letters include recommendations for and correspondence
         with former students and graduate students, answers to
         inquiries concerning the University or the History Department,
         and letters from colleagues.</p>
      <p>The fourth series is comprised of eleven Hollinger boxes of
         papers relating to the Department of History at the University
         of Virginia. Much of the correspondence (1951-1963) is that of
         Thomas Perkins Abernethy and Oron J. Hale, who were chairmen
         of the department before Younger assumed that post in 1962. As
         in the general correspondence series, much of this
         correspondence is with former graduate students concerning
         their subsequent careers. The remainder of the series is
         arranged alphabetically by topic, and includes alumni
         correspondence, files on Younger's courses, faculty recruiting
         and promotions, fellowships, graduate student jobs, and files
         on visiting lecturers. There is one Hollinger box of material
         relating to the N.D.E.A. Institute in American History, held
         at the University of Virginia in 1965.</p>
      <p>The fifth series consists of nine Hollinger boxes of papers
         relating to Younger's positions at the University of Virginia
         outside of the History Department. Most of these papers are
         from Younger's period as dean of the Graduate School of Arts
         and Sciences, while the remainder reflect the various
         institutes he directed and committees of which he was a
         member. Topics covered include Asian Studies, Commencement,
         the Community College Teachers' Fellowship Program which
         Younger directed in 1969-1971, the Graduate School Lecture
         Series, and the Special Master's Degree Program which Younger
         directed in 1962-1967.</p>
      <p>Series six consists of nineteen Hollinger boxes of student
         academic papers. Most of these are copies of papers written by
         students for Younger's courses. This series has been divided
         into three sub-series: 1) papers on Virginia History, 2)
         historiography and bibliography, and 3) papers on
         miscellaneous subjects. Many of the papers on Virginia history
         are based on original research and reflect Younger's special
         interest in this subject.</p>
      <p>The seventh series is made up of 1/2 Hollinger box of
         photographs: pictures of John A. Kasson for Younger's
         biography; pictures of the History Department faculty and the
         Naval War College staff; and pictures selected for, but not
         used in, John H. Moore's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Albemarle: Jefferson's
         County</title>.</p>
      <p>Series eight is Younger's file on individual students,
         including correspondence and letters of recommendation. Access
         to this series is restricted according to the terms of the
         Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.</p>
      <p>The tape recordings in series nine are chiefly Younger
         lectures. They include lectures on U.S. foreign policy and on
         the role of the historian in contemporary society which
         Younger gave in India in 1958 and 1963, a lecture on
         "Neutralism" given before the Air War College in 1963, and a
         lecture entitled "Background of U.S. Global Strategic
         Commitments" which was given before the Naval War College in
         1961. Texts and related correspondence for some of these
         lectures can be found in the "Papers re India," the "Papers re
         Naval War College," and the "Lectures" listed below.</p>
      <p>The oversize material consists of additional research
         material for the biography of Kasson and of galley proofs of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Albemarle: Jefferson's County</title>,
