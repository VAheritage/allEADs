         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection consists of twenty-two family and
         professional letters written to Dr. George B. Harrison, of
         Washington, D.C., all written in 1885.</p>
         <p>Several of the letters are from patients and are concerned
         with their care, including C. Chittenden (October 2, 1885);
         Mary Murphy (November 2, 7, &amp; 13); Walter Potts (November
         10, 1885); and Harrison's niece, Lucie (December 25,
         1885).</p>
         <p>Also present are letters from other doctors, Dr. Henry
         Davidson Fry (October 8, 1885); Dr. Howard Hines Barker
         (October 26, 1885); Dr. Edward E. Feild, who mentions: working
         side by side with Harrison in the lecture rooms at the
         University of Virginia, Dr. Meade C. Kemper's recent move to a
         practice near him in Norfolk, Virginia, and other fellow
         University of Virginia graduates from the medical school,
         including James Duncan Gatewood, and Douglas Tardy (October 4,
         1885); and Dr. John Fitzhugh May (October 9, 1885). Drs. Feild
         and May graduated with Harrison from the University of
         Virginia in 1879.</p>
         <p>Family letters include three from his brother, Randolph
         Harrison, who was Commissioner, Department of Agriculture, for
         the state of Virginia in 1885. Randolph Harrison mentions
         missing an invitation from General [Fitzhugh?] Lee and his
         intention to visit the Rockbridge Alum Springs which was
         ordered for his health by Dr. Crenshaw (September 17, 1885).
         He also refers to the visit of Jeanne Harrison and children to
         the Rockbridge Baths to enjoy the mountain air (August 24,
         1885). His third letter describes his "rapid retreat" from the
         Rockbridge Alum Springs to Richmond due to being very sick
         with dysentery and a fever, and his fear at being stuck there
         (October 2, 1885). The same letter also describes his
         attendance at an [Agricultural ?] Fair, where he spoke.</p>
         <p>Other family letters include six from his wife, Jeanne,
         chiefly while she was away with the children at the Rockbridge
         Baths in August 1885, describing her journey to the baths by
         train and then riding in a carriage with Miss Morrison,
         presumably the daughter of Dr. Samuel Brown Morrison who
         operated the sanitarium. She also mentions the activities of
         the children, William Evelyn and Margaret, and other family
         members, and the injuries of their son's foot and eye (August
         21, 23, Sep 12, 14, &amp; 15, 1885).</p>
