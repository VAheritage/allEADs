         <p>This collection consists of eleven letters of 
         <persname>George Williams</persname>, a Civil War soldier from
         <geogname>Monroeville, Huron County, Ohio</geogname>, to his
         family, 1862-1864. Based on internal information, he was a
         musician in 
         <corpname>Company B, 123rd Ohio Regiment</corpname>. A history
         edited by C. M. Keyes, 
         <bibref>
               <title>The Military History Of the 123d Regiment Ohio
            Volunteer Infantry</title>
            </bibref>(Sandusky: Register Steam Press, 1874), is available
         in the Rare Books Division of the Special Collections
         Department (call number E525.5 123d 1874).</p>
         <p>Company B was recruited and enrolled into the service with
         the regiment at 
         <geogname>Monroeville, Huron County</geogname>during
         August-September 1862. The 123rd was sent to what later became
         <geogname>West Virginia</geogname>and served in a variety of
         capacities and operations including reconnaissances, scouts,
         raids, siege, occupation, and provost duties. It was
         surrendered during the battle of 
         <geogname>Winchester</geogname>in June 1863 and imprisoned
         until paroled and exchanged in August. The 123rd participated
         in the Union's Shenandoah Valley Campaign (1864), the
         Petersburg siege (1864-1865), and the Appomattox Campaign
         (1865). Williams and his regiment were honorably mustered out
         of the army on 12 June 1865.</p>
         <p>Accompanied by modern-day typescripts and photocopies of a
         photograph of Williams in uniform, the letters were written in
         various 
         <geogname>West Virginia</geogname>towns [ 
         <geogname>Beverly</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Huttonsville</geogname>, 
         <geogname>New Creek</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Martinsburg</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Petersburg</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Romney</geogname>] and 
         <geogname>Winchester, Virginia</geogname>; they discuss
         personal, family, and war news. Williams is primarily a
         distant observer and commentator of miscellaneous events, not
         a participant. Members of his and other Ohio regiments [34th,
         101st, 110th, 116th, 120th, 122nd; and the 87th Pennsylvania]
         as well as various generals, are mentioned by name: 
         <persname>Ambrose E. Burnside</persname>[1824-1881]; 
         <persname>George Crook</persname>[1828-1890]; 
         <persname>Joseph Hooker</persname>[1814-1879]; 
         <persname>Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson</persname>[1824-1863];
         <persname>Robert E. Lee</persname>[1807-1870]; 
         <persname>Robert Milroy</persname>[1816-1890]; 
         <persname>James A. Mulligan</persname>[1830-1864]; 
         <persname>William Rosecrans</persname>[1819-1898]; and 
         <persname>Franz Sigel</persname>[1824-1902].</p>
         <p>The majority of the letters are to his sister, Lill ( 
         <persname>Lillis Williams</persname>), a resident of 
         <geogname>Monroeville</geogname>. On 6 November 1862, he
         writes from Beverly [West Virginia] that members of the 
         <corpname>101st Ohio Regiment</corpname>have been promoted but
         two members of the 
         <corpname>87th Pennsylvania</corpname>were shot by guards for
         attempted arson, and, his recent vaccination (his arm is still
         sore). He has written two letters for fellow musician 
         <persname>Joseph Sallabank</persname>. A letter of 12 November
         from Huttonsville rejects rumors that 
         <persname>Jefferson Davis</persname>wants peace. Williams also
         claims that the mountains surrounding the town prevent the
         flow of cold air and its residents have never seen a railroad
         or a steamboat.</p>
         <p>From New Creek [West Virginia] on 19 November 1862,
         Williams describes his regiment's travels by foot and rail
         from 
         <geogname>Monroeville</geogname>to the 
         <geogname>West Virginia</geogname>towns of 
         <geogname>Beverly</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Webster</geogname>; the 
         <corpname>Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</corpname>, the presence
         of 15,000 Union troops, the 
         <geogname>Potomac River</geogname>, and General Stonewall
         Jackson are mentioned. Williams believes 
         <geogname>New Creek</geogname>to be a civilized country
         because "things are cheap." His letter of 21 November 1862
         refers to the presence of General 
         <persname>James A. Mulligan</persname>'s [1830-1864] Irish
         Brigade and the 110th, 120th and 122nd Ohio regiments; Sibley
         tents, 
         <geogname>New Creek</geogname>farmers as pleasant and
         generous, and General Ambrose Burnside are also mentioned.
         Williams declares that 
         <persname>Stonewall Jackson</persname>is in retreat thanks to
         the efforts of Generals 
         <persname>Franz Sigel</persname>, 
         <persname>William Rosecrans</persname>, and 
         <persname>Robert Milroy</persname>. Two forts [Fort Piano and
         Fort Fuller?] are being constructed for the defense of the
         area.</p>
         <p>On 1 January 1863 Williams writes from Petersburg [West
         Virginia] about his comrades' purchase of chickens from
         blacks, camp news, Burnside's defeat at the battle of 
         <geogname>Fredericksburg</geogname>, and an inspection by
         acting general Colonel 
         <persname>James Washburn</persname>of the 116th Ohio Regiment.
         His letter from Romney, 28 February 1863, reports the arrival
         of new guns and clothing and expresses the regiment's pride in
         serving with Colonel "Billy Willson" [ 
         <persname>William T. Wilson</persname>] by recounting an
         incident which endeared him to his troops: "The quartermaster
         made out a requisition for Clothing a long time ago but the
         clothing didn't come till the Colonel sayed if they didn't
         send it Shortly he would take his men whare it was--it came a
         few days after." Williams sends "some old papers I found down
         in the Court House"; describes the town's founders as lunatics
         for locating it in the mountains, and remarks that two Romney
         companies are serving with the Confederate Army.</p>
         <p>Williams' first letter from Winchester, Virginia, 4 May
         1863, describes rainy weather which has turned into shirt
         sleeve/barefoot weather, payday, and General Milroy's
         preparations for the town's defense, including two well-manned
         forts [Fort Jackson and Fort Collier?]; General 
         <persname>Joseph Hooker</persname>has crossed the 
         <geogname>Rappahannock River</geogname>to attack the rebels.
         He also reports the death of Private 
         <persname>[Joseph] Tuman</persname>of Company B and his burial
         in 
         <geogname>Martinsburg</geogname>. Williams speaks of having
         received a letter from Lill and mentions 
         <persname>Maria Hillyer</persname>(another sister?) and her
         son Eddy (his nephew?) as experiencing in-laws troubles with
         the Hillyers. Six days later, 10 May 1863, he requests
         stationery and reports his regiment's capture of four
         prisoners, Hooker's "grand Sham fight" (defeat) at 
         <geogname>Chancellorsville</geogname>[May 1-4, 1863], rebel
         raids on railroads, and the dismissal of a drum major.</p>
         <p>His letter of 14 May 1863 tells of rebel raids toward 
         <geogname>Parkersburg</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Clarksburg</geogname>and newspaper accounts of the
         death of 
         <persname>Stonewall Jackson</persname>("he was the worst enemy
         we ever had"). Private 
         <persname>[Malvern H.] Barnhart</persname>died after an
         illness of twenty-four hours was treated with morphine and
         opium--his remains were sent to 
         <geogname>Martinsburg</geogname>for burial. This letter
         continues on the 15th with a description of 
         <geogname>Winchester</geogname>as good country for fruit and
         flower gardens and that Williams' band (three drummers and
         eight fifers) is to perform at the funeral of a member of
         Company C. Meanwhile, the drum major has been discharged ("he
         never was of no account"). While in Martinsburg, 28 October
         1863, Williams reports the capture of 
         <geogname>Charles Town, West Virginia</geogname>. As the
         colonel is on leave the regiment "will not amount to much"
         until his return. The rebels have crossed the 
         <geogname>Rappahannock</geogname>but "Our Generals are not
         sharp enough for old Lea" [ 
         <persname>Robert E. Lee</persname>].</p>
         <p>The last letter of these collections was written at
         Winchester on 24 September 1864. Williams celebrates recent
         Union victories in the 
         <geogname>Shenandoah Valley</geogname>[the battles of 
         <geogname>Winchester</geogname>, 19 September, and 
         <geogname>Fishers Hill</geogname>, 22 September] and includes
         a brief account of the wounded and the aftermath--all homes
         and churches were converted to the hospitals and there was not
         enough time to bury the dead; it took three days just to bury
         dead rebels. According to him, Company B did not suffer any
         casualties. General 
         <persname>George Crook</persname>, and the dishonorable
         discharge [30 August 1864] of Captain 
         <persname>Lemuel E. Merry</persname>, 34th Ohio Regiment, are
         mentioned.</p>
