        <p>This collection of drawings was presented to the Library
            by Mrs. Clarence W. Wenger of Charlottesville on November

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of 1,074 drawings from 207
         projects, 1940-1981, undertaken by Clarence W. Wenger, an
         architect based first in Harrisonburg, Virginia, from 1933
         until 1961, and later in Charlottesville. His projects or
         "jobs" represented in this collection include residential,
         commercial, industrial, educational, and religious buildings,
         in addition to a few engineering drawings. While the majority
         of these projects were contemplated for Harrisonburg and
         Charlottesville, Mr. Wenger's work extended to many Virginia
         communities and to West Virginia and South Carolina.</p>
      <p>The drawings are arranged by number assigned to each job.
         For each job, there is a worksheet that includes the project
         date, location, architectural style, and total number of
         drawings in various categories. Under "Architectural
         Drawings," for instance, there are nine categories such as
         "Site Plan," "External Elevation," and "Rendering," while
         under "Engineering Drawings" are "Structural," "HVAC," and
         "Property Survey." The media used--pencil on paper, for
         example--are noted. Additional information is sometimes
         provided at the bottom of the worksheet to indicate whether
         more than one category of drawing is included on one
         sheet.</p>
