      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of twenty-five letters primarily
         correspondence of the Massie family during 1850-1862. Six
         letters, ca. 1858-1859, are from E. B. Massie to his mother,
         Mrs. E. F. Massie of Waynesboro. They concern his schoolboy
         experiences at the Brookland School, Greenwood Depot,
         Albemarle County, Virginia, where W.M. Dinwiddie, M.A., was
         Principal. Most of these deal with the son's examinations and
         requests for shoes; one undated letter concerns the acceptance
         of Christianity by him and other boys in the school and the
         impact it has had on their lives and on the institution. He
         also describes his election as President of the Piedmont at
         the school, where he expects soon to be selected as "Worthy
         Patron of the Division." He also mentions in the same letter a
         visit to the school by Mr. Launcelot Blackford and Mr. [ ]
         Strother, adding that Mr. Blackford led a very good prayer
         meeting while there.</p>
      <p>Two letters are to Mrs. E. F. Massie of Waynesboro from
         another son, J. L. Massie, written from the University of
         Virginia, where he was a student. On January 27, 1859, he
         writes about upcoming exams and the approaching marriage of
         Mr. [John Barbee] Minor. On March 7, 1859, he mentions the
         death from typhoid fever of a fellow student, C. C. Lewis of
         Clarke County.</p>
      <p>A communication on June 30, 1859, from S[ocrates] Maupin,
         Chairman of the Faculty at the University of Virginia, is to
         Nathaniel Massie, Waynesboro, giving grade reports on his son,
         J. L. Massie.</p>
      <p>On February 17, 1859, Charles M. Massie writes from New
         Orleans to Bob [ ] telling of his attempts to set up business
         in that city. He describes having met many Virginians and
         depicts New Orleans as being extremely busy "with all sorts of
         dissipation being suspended," including that of Rodes, who has
         "turned over a new leaf."</p>
      <p>On September 9, 1862, N. H. Massie writes from
         Charlottesville to his sister expressing his sadness at the
         death of her husband William on the battlefield at Manassas.
         He also describes an epidemic of scarlet fever at his home
         where three of his own children and three children of the
         servants have been affected.</p>
