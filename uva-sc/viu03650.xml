      <p>Cheuse was born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, the son of
         Philip and Henrietta (Diamond) Cheuse. He was educated at
         Lafayette College and Rutgers University, receiving his Ph.D.
         from Rutgers in 1974. His career has been one of variety; he
         has been a reporter for Fairchild Publications; a staff member
         of the Kirkus Review Service; a member of the editorial board
         for

         reviews for many national magazines and National Public Radio,
         short stories, three works of fiction,

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers of novelist and book reviewer Alan Cheuse (1940-
         ), contain ca. 1,025 items (10 Hollinger boxes, 3.5 linear
         feet), 1976-1987. They include: drafts of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Fall Out of Heaven </title>(1987); his
         short stories, both in hard copy and on diskettes, and his
         book reviews, many of which were prepared for "All Things
         Considered" on National Public Radio; personal and
         professional correspondence; newsclippings; printed material;
         interviews; and photographs.</p>
      <p>Much of this material was generated by Cheuse during his
         association with the University of Virginia in the spring of
         1987 as a visiting lecturer in the Creative Writing Program of
         the English Department, especially his correspondence and the
         manuscripts for 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Fall Out of Heaven </title>.</p>
      <p>The collection is arranged in three series. The manuscript
         series is entirely composed of various drafts of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Fall Out of Heaven </title>, including
         typescripts, computer print-outs, drafts with editors'
         corrections and comments, a setting copy, page proof, and
         material related to the book.</p>
      <p>Cheuse's book 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Fall Out of Heaven </title>incorporates
         the previously unpublished autobiographical novel of his
         father, Philip K. Cheuse (1910-1983), who was born near Kiev,
         Russia, and served as a lieutenant in the Red Air Force,
         mainly flying against rebellious eastern tribesmen near Khiva,
         Uzbekistan, Soviet Union. After many adventures, Philip Cheuse
         eventually emigrated to the United States and led a more
         conventional life in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. The novel also
         relates the conflicts between Cheuse and his father and
         includes Cheuse's own journey to the Soviet Union and the
         Orient in 1986, where he traced his father's footsteps.</p>
      <p>Related materials include: the original manuscript of
         Philip Cheuse's autobiography, notes kept by Alan Cheuse on
         his trip through the Soviet Union for the book, travel
         literature about the Soviet Union, a synopsis of the book, and
         a blue line copy of the book jacket.</p>
      <p>The correspondence with friends, colleagues, and publishers
         is both personal and professional and generally discusses
         their projects and work, personal lives, and Cheuse's books
         and reviews. It also consists of arrangements for readings,
         lectures, and book signings; submissions for publication;
         grants; and job openings.</p>
      <p>A few of the correspondents include: E.L. Doctorow (March
         15, 1986); Stuart Wright (November 12, 1986); Richard Ford
         (December 18, 1986, &amp; April 8 &amp; 27, 1987); Annie
         Dillard (March 28, April 1 &amp; 23, 1987); and Josephine
         Humphreys regarding the telling of stories (February 19,
         1987). Topics include: "Southern writing" (December 18, 1986);
         Kim Basinger (February 7, 1987); a memorial service for
         Bernard Malamud (March 30, 1987); and India and Pakistan
         (April 11, 1987). The 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Fall Out of
         Heaven </title>correspondence includes a letter from Cheuse,
         March 29, 1987, explaining the process of writing the book
         about his father and his own childhood. The correspondence
         with his publisher, Gibbs M. Smith, Inc., concerns the
         publication of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Grandmothers' Club </title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Fall Out of Heaven </title>.</p>
      <p>The series of miscellaneous papers includes: an article and
         research notes on Barbara Mandrell; book reviews by Alan
         Cheuse, arranged by the last name of the authors with reviews
         of groups of books at the end; a file on the Bennington
