         the front; observations and comments on the U.S. presidential
         election, 1916; Woodrow Wilson's visit to Italy and the peace
         conference in 1919; and a convention of the Episcopal church
         in 1919 and proposed changes to the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Book of Common Prayer.</title></p>

         democracy. The diary for 1920 contains an essay on the history
         of gardening; an analysis of literature versus writing; notes
         for a talk on World War I induced changes in the U. S.; and

         World War" including thoughts on William Jennings Bryan,
         Walter Page's views on Booker T. Washington, the Marchese di
         San Giuliano, Italy before the war, Italy in the Panama
         exposition, Victor Emmanuel III, the Avezzano earthquake,
         1914, Sir George and Lady Trevelyan, and the Balkan

      <p>In a letter, 1916 January 17, Jenny Nelson writes
         discussing prison inmates with whom she corresponds and also
         her Sunday School class of inmates, some of whom were
         mistreated by the police. She thanks Page for funds which she
         used to treat the inmates and aid an impoverished African
         American family. She conveys family news including the story
         of two run-away children.</p>
      <p>In a letter 1920 November 25, Gino Speranza writes
         concerning the election of 1920 and the bloc voting of
         Italian-Americans.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains an autograph manuscript review
         by [John Stuart Mill?] of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Public Responsibility and Vote by
         Ballot by an Elector,</title> 1865, presumably owned by Page.</p>
