      <p>John Janney, born November 8, 1798, was the son of Elisha
         and Mary (Gibson) Janney of Loudoun County. Janney played a
         large part in the development of Loudoun County, and was one
         of the leading attorneys in Virginia. He married Alcinda
         "Alice" S. Marmaduke on January 26, 1826, and became a citizen
         of Leesburg where he made his home for the remainder of his
         life. Although he did not take a very active part in politics,
         he was so well regarded by his fellow Whigs that he was
         drafted on several important occasions. He was a member of the
         Virginia Assembly as delegate from Loudoun County, and was a
         Whig elector in the presidential campaign of 1844. Janney was
         known for the eloquence with which he expressed the principles
         of his political party. He was elected a delegate to the
         Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850, and, in 1860, a adelegate to the Secession Convention of 1861, then
         being elected by the Union men as president of the Convention.
         Janney opposed secession, however he accepted the adoption of
         the ordinance of secession when it was passed in April 1861.
         He continued to be an important influence on Virginia politics
         until his death on January 5, 1872.</p>
      <p>Robert Stevenson Janney, born September 22, 1915, was the
         son of Abram David Pollock and Lucy (Stevenson) Janney. He
         received his education from Princeton University and was
         awarded the New York Herald Prize for his thesis on "Foreign
         Policy of the United States 1930-37." From August 1937 to
         spring 1938 he took a trip around the world, sailing around
         Europe, India and Asia. In 1937 he made 2nd lieutenant R. O.
         T. C. in the United States Field Artillery, and in July 1941
         transferred to the Army Air Force and became 1st lieutenant.
         He trained at bases in Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama and South
         Carolina. He received his wings at Moody Field, Valdosta,
         Georgia in July 1942. Following intensive training in Light
         Bomb Group, he was made Captain, and in January 1943, he flew
         the South Atlantic and took part in the North Africa Campaign.
         In Italy he was with the 27th Fighter Bomber Group 12th Army
         Air Force as Group Operations Officer. During February to July
         1943 he flew missions over Casablanca, Oran, Algiers and
         Tunis; from July until August 1943, he was stationed on Malta
         and then in Sicily. He was promoted to Major in November 1943.
         He was killed on a mission over Cecina, Italy on January 16,
         1944. He received the Air Medal with three oak clusters and
         the Purple Heart award.</p>

         personal correspondence, political correspondence and papers,
         and financial and legal papers.</p>
      <p>There are Civil War correspondence and papers of John
         Janney and Alcinda "Alice" S. (Marmaduke) Janney. There is a
         pass, June 5, 1861, for James C. Janney to go through the
         lines at Harper's Ferry. On August 22, 1861, John Janney,
         Leesburg, writes to [Joseph Eggleston] Johnston (1807-1891),
         Manassas Junction, about the illness of his servant "George"
         who drove his team to the Junction, offers fifty acres of hay,
         and requests that his horses with the artillery be returned.
         There is a list dated August-September 1861 of "Sick Soldiers
         nursed by Mrs. John P. Smart and Mrs. John Janney." On
         September 10, 1861, Arthur L. Rogers, Loudoun Artillery,
         writes concerning the appraisement of Janney's horses and the
         need for horses in service. On October 25, 1862, wife of
         William Barksdale (1821-1863), 
         <persname normal="Narcissa L. Smith Barksdale">N[arcissa] L. [(Smith)]
         Barksdale</persname> (d. 1875), Oakwood, near Columbus, Mississippi,
         writes to Alcinda Janney, reminiscing over her visit to
         Leesburg, and wishing she was able to avenge the wrongdoings
         done to Mr. Janney. She also describes the trip from Orange
         Court House to Huntsville, Alabama to Corinth and Columbus,
         Mississippi, mentioning the starving and sick soldiers
         encountered; and, mentions that Bayou Lara, Louisiana was
         burnt, that the sugar crop is large in Louisiana, that there
         were several marriages and births in camps, and that she has
         heard little news of her husband. There is a pass, November 1,
         1862, Headquarters, Whipple's Division, 12th Army Corps,
         Hillsborough, Virginia, for James and Robert Janney to Berlin,
         Maryland, and return with their brother Charles. On August 4,
         1865, Joseph [Eggleston] Segar (1804-1880), Washington,
         requests Janney's views as to the general sentiment in regard
         to the result of the late civil conflict and mentions
         President [Andrew] Johnson (1808-1875). In his letter of
         August 7, 1865 to Segar, Janney comments on the action of the
         military authority to nullify the election. There is another
         letter, April 1866, from Mrs. 
         <persname normal="Narcissa L. Smith Barksdale">N[arcissa] L. [(Smith)]
         Barksdale</persname>. Columbus, Mississippi, to [Alcinda Janney], wishing
         to see her friends in Leesburg, mentioning her
         African-American servants, Matilda and John, hoping that her
         sons, 
         <persname normal="Ethelbert">Ethel[bert]</persname>(1859-1892)
         and Willie [William] (1856-1877), may become such men as their
         father, and mentioning acquaintances, Lieutenant and Captain
         Tucker, of the St. George Tucker family. Mrs. Barksdale refers
         to the death of her husband, William Barksdale, writing "My
         life has been one long day of sorrow since I left Virginia,
         and the sun of my life set at Gettysburg" and the problems in
         bringing his remains home.</p>
      <p>There are two Civil War memorandums: "Events of the War,"
         August-September 1862 and "War Memo" June-July 1863, by
         Alcinda S. (Marmaduke) Janney. "Events of the War" begins with
         the explanation that Leesburg was first taken possession of by
         the Federal forces under the command of [John White] Geary on
         the 8th of March following the evacuation by the Confederate
         troops under General [Ambrose Powell] Hill, General [Richard]
         Griffith, Colonel [Winfield Scott] Featherston, and Colonel
         [William] Barksdale. In August, several Leesburg residents
         were arrested, including John Janney, N. Braden, Rev. Nourse,
         and Armistead Vandeventer. Mrs. Janney mentions Yankee
         soldiers entering the drugstore and peoples' homes looking for
         food and Colonel Geary requesting a room. She writes that the
         main body of troops occupied the town and a portion encamped
         on the "Morven" estate. Referring to March again, she writes
         that upon evacuation, General Hill gave orders to burn wheat
         stacks along Point of Rocks, Maryland, the finest mill on the
         Potomac, and a fine depot in the suburbs. In August, Leesburg
         and the surrounding area is left under Federal rule but the
         blockade was raised. The formation of a "Home Guard" disturbed
         the relative quiet, when they began to confiscate goods and
         arms from stores and raiding the houses of secessionists. She
         relates that a company of Southern cavalry arrived for the
         first time since March and were involved in some skirmishes
         with the enemy, that they met with General [William] Barksdale
         and Captain Doherty, and that the Southern troop left for
         Maryland. The "War Memo" relates the outrages committed by the
         Yankee troops and the conflicting news and rumors heard by
         civilians concerning the progress of the war. The June 28th
         entry finds Confederate troops on their farm procuring two old
         carriage horses and other necessities, causing an estimated
         loss of $2000 to $2500, according to [servant] "George"; the
         two old carriage horses were apparently returned at the
         insistence of "an old colored free woman." The June 29th entry
         mentions the Eleventh Corps under General [Oliver Otis] Howard
         being encamped on the portion of the Janney farm taken care of
         by [Thomas] Havener and committing outrages and that "they
         spoke of their deeds being justifiable because Mr. J was the
         President of the Va. Convention..." She writes of stories
         heard about various officers and their activities, including
         [Alexander Peter] Stewart, [Richard Stoddert] Ewell, [James]
         Longstreet, 
         <persname normal="Ambrose">A[mbrose]</persname><persname normal="Powell">P[owell]</persname>Hill, and Robert
         E. Lee. She also mentions various places where fighting
         supposedly is taking place, including Point of Rocks,
         Maryland, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Vicksburg, Mississippi,
         and Charleston, South Carolina. The July 25th - 29th entries
         relate to civilian activity; mentioned are that persons are
         being allowed to travel safely to Washington and Baltimore
         without papers and the "murder" of a civilian named Mathews on
         the river near Whitesford.</p>
      <p>The financial and legal papers of John Janney consist of
         correspondence, memorandums of agreement and other legal
         documents, and accounts and bills of sale pertaining to
         Janney's legal practice and his farm operation. Among the
         papers, 1832-1839, are: license to practice law in Virginia
         (December 24, 1829); correspondence about claims against the
         deceased Solomon Parsons (January 24, 1832 and September 10,
         1834); opinion on the wills of John and Mary Hawling, with
         copies of the wills (1832); papers on Brown vs. Taylor (ca.
         1832-1847); and, letter from John Sinclair, Mountsville,
         relating the courses and lengths of the lines and descriptions
         of the corners in dispute between Charles Fenton Mercer and
         the Skinners (January 20, 1837). Among the papers, 1841-1848,
         are: an account of Amos Janney and Edmund Jennings (June 8,
         1841); memorandum of agreement between Alexander Kilgam and
         Aquila Janney re a tract of land in Loudoun County (December
         20, 1844); and, a circular letter announcing the establishment
         of the firm N. E. Janney and Company in the china, glass, and
         earthenware business (April 1, 1848). There is also
         correspondence from the period of 1841-1848. On October 10,
         1841, Barrow [Frere ?], Cottage Farm, Aldie, Loudoun County,
         writes concerning financial obligations with a postscript on
         "an improved implement for cleaning the roads." There are
         letters, July 20 &amp; 22, 1846, from Benjamin B. Davis,
         Salem, Ohio, to Samuel M. Janney, Springdale, Loudoun County,
         with copies of documents, concerning the legacy of Rebecca
         (McArtor) Murphy from Mahlon McArtor. On May 24, 1847, Abbott
         Lawrence (1792-1855), Boston, writes to John [Strother]
         Pendleton (1802-1868), Culpeper, that the machine shop at
         Lowell is full, with 600 persons at work, and that a new
         machine shop will be opening in the new town of Lawrence, and
         praises the young men from Virginia working in the machine
         shop. On October 23, 1847, Benjamin Hawley, Salem, Ohio,
         writes to Samuel M. Janney, Springdale, Loudoun County, on
         behalf of Rebecca (McArtor) Murphy. There is a letter, October
         11, 1847, from John Sinclair concerning a land dispute between
         Edward P. Upton and Jonathan Beard. Among the papers,
         1850-1859, are: bill of sale for a "negro woman 
         <persname normal="Harriett">H[arriett ?]</persname>Jackson"
         and "to warrant her to be a slave for life" from William H.
         Gallagher, Morrow, Ohio, to John Janney; answer of Common
         Council in Council of Alexandria vs. William Wheeler (August
         13, 1850); and, Abraham heirs certificates (January 1853).
         There is an agreement, September 30, 1850, between John Janney
         and Thomas Havener to hire the latter as a farmer on land
         owned by Janney in Loudoun County, describing the conditions.
         There are also a memorandum of agreement and accompanying
         papers, 1851-1862, between Robert Beverley and Charles C.

      <p>The personal correspondence of John Janney and Alcinda
         "Alice" S. (Marmaduke) Janney refer chiefly to family news but
         does contain some political references. On December 5, 1831,
         Alice Janney, Hillsborough, expresses her feelings on the
         death of her twenty-three year old daughter, Cornelia, and
         includes a poem dedicated to her daughter. There are two
         letters, April 23 and May 11, 1841, from S. H. Williams,
         Cumberland, Maryland, concerning family news, including the
         last days and death of their child Alice. Letters from John
         Janney and Alice Janney dated September 19, October 1 and
         November 3, 1848 refer to the illness of Nathaniel Ellicott
         Janney and the family's efforts to take him home before his
         death. They describe the family's journey on the steamer
         "Alice" on the Ohio River, the last days and subsequent death
         of Nathaniel Janney with his wife, Sarah [Ann Irwin] Janney,
         and other family by his side; and, mention the arrival of
         Robert H. Miller, husband of Anna [Janney Miller]. On April
         24, 1851, John Janney, Richmond, writes to Alice Janney
         referring to mixed basis representation and the numerous
         politicians speaking their opinions on the subject. An April
         25, 1854 letter from George Adre, Greenwood, discusses the
         fire that destroyed his house. On April 23, 1861, John Janney,
         Richmond, writes Alice Janney that there may be trouble in
         Washington, Richmond is full of troops, and that General
         Robert E. Lee was introduced in the House. There is a letter,
         [April 1861], from John Janney, Alexandria, to Alice Janney,
         with the news that Tennessee has been electing members of
         convention and that he is to be president of the Convention in
         Richmond. He also mentions the books, The Children of the
         Abbey and Evelina [or, The History of a Young Lady's Entrance
         into the World]. There is a letter, August 16, 1871, from

         in Rockingham County, Va..." printed on the verso. There are
         two letters, September 30 and October 10, 1880, from Thamsin
         Janney, Lincoln, Virginia, to Alice Janney, sending medication
         and giving directions for their use.</p>
      <p>The political papers of John Janney are rich in discussions
         of the principles and activities of the Whig party,
         presidential elections, prominent politicians, and other
         aspects of Virginia and national politics from the 1830's
         until the 1860's.</p>
      <p>There are certifications, November 1836, that a
         presidential and vice-presidential election was held in the
         counties of Loudoun, Fairfax and Fauquier. In a letter of
         March 26, 1838, Henry Clay (1777-1852) writes to Janney
         concerning the speech of John 
         <persname normal="Caldwell">C[aldwell]</persname>Calhoun
         (1782-1850) which was brought to the attention of the Senate
         by Daniel Webster (1782-1852), Calhoun voting against the
         engrossment of the Sub-Treasury Bill, and hopes that the
         measure will be defeated in the House. Letters and documents
         of April 9 &amp; 21 and May 1, 1838, concern Janney's
         appointment to represent the state of Virginia at all meetings
         of the stockholders of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company
         in the absence of Charles 
         <persname normal="James">J[ames]</persname>Faulkner.</p>
      <p>During 1840 there are numerous invitations to Janney to
         either attend or speak at meetings, conventions and festivals
         in support of William Henry Harrison and John Tyler and the
         Whig party. A circular letter of May 30, 1840 from Clarksburg,
         invites the recipient to attend a convention of delegates "to
         aid the great cause of Reform in promoting the Election of
         General William Henry Harrison and John Tyler." There is a
         letter, June 11, 1840, from Samuel Chilton, Warrenton, written
         on behalf of the Central Whig Committee of Vigilance of
         Fauquier County; and, a letter, June 16, 1840, from G.
         Cuthbert Powell, Middleburg, concerning preparations for a
         large assemblage of people in July. A circular letter of July
         13, 1840 from Wheeling, invites the recipient to attend a
         convention in that city to "aid the cause of Harrison, Tyler
         and Reform" to be held by the Whigs of the states of Virginia,
         Pennsylvania and Ohio. A circular letter of August 24, 1840
         from Martinsburg invites the recipient to attend a public
         festival in the good cause of Harrison and Reform to be held
         by the Whigs of Berkeley County on September 10th. On August

         <persname normal="James">J[ames]</persname>Faulkner
         (1806-1884), Martinsburg, writes concerning his attendance at
         the event on September 10th. On August 29, 1840, 
         <persname normal="Philip">P[hilip]</persname><persname normal="Ricard">R[icard]</persname>Fendall
         (1794-1868), Washington, inquires about William Henry
         Harrison's and Martin Van Buren's militia plans. A circular
         letter of September 1, 1840 from Richmond, invites the
         recipient to attend the Whig State Convention to be held on
         October 5th. There is a letter, September 21, 1840, from the
         sub-committee of arrangements for the Whig State Convention to
         be held on October 5th, concerning the proposed arrangement to
         have a meeting of the several electors of the district on the
         day before the convention in order to form a college to select
         a president and secretary whose names will be announced by one
         of the electors. A circular letter of September 22, 1840
         states the resolutions adopted at the September 17th meeting
         of the Democratic Whig Club of Norfolk concerning the plans of
         the Grand Whig Encampment on the Plains of York Town to be
         held on October 19th. There are certifications, November 1840,
         that a presidential and vice-presidential election was held in
         the counties of Loudoun and Fairfax.</p>
      <p>There is a heartfelt letter, July 4, 1843, from Janney,
         Philadelphia, regretfully declining an invitation to unite
         with his fellow Whigs in that city, adding a sentiment on the
         "Cradle of American Liberty." During 1844 there are numerous
         invitations to attend or speak at meetings, conventions and
         festivals in support of Henry Clay and the Whig party. An
         interesting letter of February 22, 1844, from 
         <persname normal="Jeremiah">J[eremiah]</persname>Morton
         (1799-1898), "Moreland," Fluvanna County, discusses William

         debt and the bank and tariff question. On February 27, 1844,
         R. T. Daniel of Richmond writes as chairman of the Whig
         Central State Committee, to the Whig Electors in the state,
         making some suggestions on the gain of monies in order to
         publish and circulate the "Whig Address" and "Facts from the
         Record" and the registering of all Whig voters for the spring
         and fall elections by the appointment of an executive
         committee. A circular letter of March 9, 1844, "Young Men's
         Whig National Convention of Ratification. To the Young Whigs
         of the United States," serves as an invitation for a
         convention to be held on May 2nd in Baltimore. On March 9,
         1844, Wyndham Robertson (1803-1888), Fluvanna County, comments
         at great length on an editorial in the Whig on March 5th and
         other articles which apparently misrepresented his own remarks
         and those actions passed in the Committee, and also mentions
         [Willoughby ?] Newton (1802- 1874), [John Caldwell] Calhoun,
         and [Daniel] Webster. A circular letter of July 8, 1844,

         Washington, writes putting forth suggestions for "the
         prominent active Whigs of the State" to "unite upon some plan
         to act in concert throughout the state," similar to the plan
         adopted by the Whigs of Ohio which involves dividing the state
         into districts. A circular letter of July 22, 1844,
         Winchester, is an invitation for a "Grand District Mass

         being present on October 1st when the Federal Court meets in
         order to make his arrangements for the continuance of his
         causes and traveling to New York in early October to attend
         the commencement of the proceedings of the Institute, and

         presidential elections were held in the counties of
         Rappahannock, Loudoun, Fauquier, Fairfax and Culpeper. There
         is an interesting letter of November 28, 1844, from John 
         <persname normal="Strother">S[trother]</persname>Pendleton
         (1802-1868), "Redwood," Culpeper, which mentions a
         conversation with Samuel Chilton about his being a candidate
         for re-election to the Congress, inquires of Janney whether he
         would accept such a nomination, and comments that public
         sentiment seems to be leaning toward Janney or himself.
         Pendleton's letter also includes a lengthy discussion of the
         future nomination and matters of consideration. There are also
         letters from Pendleton on December 9 and 10, 1844 concerning
         similar matters. On December 10, 1844, Janney writes to
         Pendleton concerning his inquiries on the next Congressional
         election and declining any nomination for himself, stating his
         views regarding this. Pendleton answers on December 16, 1844,
         commenting on Janney's letter, discussing how men in the
         public are sometimes urged to become a candidate, relating his
         regard for Janney and his own unwillingness to pursue the
         nomination if Janney were willing to, mentioning
         considerations of support from various counties, and referring
         to circumstances which would make a congressional term
         desirable to him. On December 28, 1844, J. C. Gibson,
         Culpeper, writes a lengthy, heartfelt political letter
         concerning Whigs, the Texas Whigs, Virginia, and elections and
         further wishes to solicit Janney's name as a candidate for
         this district in the ensuing election for Congress.</p>
      <p>Political letters of 1845 continue to solicit John Janney
         as a congressional candidate. Janney answers Gibson on January
         4, 1845, declining the candidacy and giving his reasons. On
         February 20, 1845, H. A. White and R. W. Payne, Warrenton,
         wish to solicit Janny's name as a candidate to represent the
         Whig party in the 9th Congressional District of Virginia while
         claiming to understand his repugnance to become a candidate
         but urging him to change his mind; they discuss the Whigs and
         the Texas Whigs. Letters of March 1st and 3rd from Janney
         decline the candidacy and explain his reasons. There is a
         letter dated [ ] 28, 1845, from 
         <persname normal="John">J[ohn]</persname><persname normal="Hill">H[ill]</persname>Carter to William B.
         Tyler which mentions the Whigs and John Janney.</p>
      <p>Political letters of 1846 chiefly concern the question of
         holding a Convention of Virginia and the Tariff. On February
         4, 1846, there is a letter from Asa Rogers, Richmond,
         reporting that the Convention question is now under discussion
         in the House of Delegates and that prominent men are giving
         speeches [in the House] including [Joel?] Leftwich (1759-1846)
         of Wythe, leader of the western people; mentioning that
         [Zachary] Taylor is leaning toward the "extreme west";
         referring to representation by whole population for districts
         as opposed to "white basis"; mentioning the state west of the
         Blue Ridge and discussing the division of the state. On
         February 11, 1846, Janney answers Rogers, writing that he is
         unable to determine public sentiment regarding the subject of
         a convention and that he feels that the public attention may
         be drawn to foreign rather than domestic relations. He relates
         that he is in favor of organizing a convention based upon the
         "mixed basis" and not upon the "white basis" and says that
         some of Taylor's people favor the "white basis" and are "under
         the impression that the additional political power is given to
         the east because of the taxation upon slaves alone, and not on
         account of taxation upon property in the mass." Janney also
         mentions that the speech of 
         <persname normal="John">J[ohn]</persname><persname normal="Strother">S[trother]</persname>Pendleton is
         being generally well received. John 
         <persname normal="Strother">S[trother]</persname>Pendleton,
         Washington, writes on February 24, 1846, requesting Janney's
         notes on the Tariff subject as he is about to examine the
         subject, and relating that the news from Europe is good
         through the prospect of peace attributed to the manner in
         which [James K.] Polk has managed the business. On March 2,
         1846, Janney sends his references on the Tariff subject and a
         copy of the "Fair Proposition" by A. H. H. Stuart, questions
         the intelligence of striking down the protective policy and
         the possible reactions from foreign government, and comments
         on various reports and expresses his views on the Tariff
         question. There are letters of introduction, ca. June-July
         1846 for Janney, explaining his inquiries into public or
         common schools, especially in regard to the plan of Free
         schools. Among the 1847 political papers is a letter, December
         19, 1847, from John 
         <persname normal="Strother">S[trother]</persname>Pendleton,
         Washington, to Harrison Gray Otis (1765-1848) and Thomas 
         <persname normal="Handasyd">H[andasyd]</persname>Perkins
         (1764- 1865), introducing Janney. There are also extracts,
         [1847], from General [Zachary] Taylor's letters, August to
         September 1847, concerning his candidacy for the
         presidency.</p>
      <p>Political letters of 1848 discuss the nomination of Zachary
         Taylor for the presidency and the Whig party. There is a
         letter of introduction, January 19, 1848, for Janney from
         Abbott Lawrence (1792- 1855), Boston, to the residents of
         Lowell. There are resolutions adopted by the Loudoun Whig
         meeting on February 14, 1848. On March 3, 1848, John Janney
         writes to John 
         <persname normal="Minor">M[inor]</persname>Botts (1802-1869),
         Washington, concerning the nomination of General Zachary
         Taylor for the presidency. A circular letter of July 14, 1848,
         Alexandria, urges action to place Virginia among the Whig
         States of the Union and includes Virginia election returns for
         1844 and 1840. A letter, August 7, 1848, from John Janney to
         John 
         <persname normal="Minor">M[inor]</persname>Botts, Washington,
         concerns their positions on the nomination of Taylor. Botts
         writes on August 23, 1848, concerning his position on the
         nomination of Taylor and his belief that [Martin] Van Buren
         will take many more Whigs in the New England states. On
         December 20, 1848, Janney writes to B. W. Harrison, having
         examined the resolutions of the General Assembly of Virginia
         which were adopted on March 8, 1847. He discusses the issue of
         slavery and its relationship to Mexico and the new territory,
         mentioning the Missouri Compromise and the Wilmot Proviso, and
         the ramifications on the border states and southern states if
         the Union dissolves.</p>
      <p>Political letters of 1849 further discuss the issue of
         slavery and the new territories. There are letters, February
         1849, urging Janney to take the nomination for a seat in the
         State Senate; there is a letter from Janney to "Fellow
         Citizens" declining to be a candidate. In a letter of February
         28, 1849, Robert E. Peyton, Gordonsdale, inquires whether or
         not Congress has a right to pass a law prohibiting slavery in
         the territories acquired from Mexico and whether or not
         Congress has a right to emancipate slaves in the District or
         forbid slave trade. In his letter of March 4, 1849, Janney
         comments on Peyton's letter, believing that it would be a
         misuse of power for Congress to prohibit slavery in California
         and New Mexico, claiming to oppose the Wilmot Proviso, stating
         that people authorized by a state constitution have the power
         to regulate slavery in their territory, believing that
         Congress has no right to abolish slavery or to forbid slave
         trade in the District of Columbia, and relating the possible
         effects on the District of Columbia if Maryland and Virginia
         ever became non-slaveholding states. On April 17, 1849, John 
         <persname normal="Strother">S[trother]</persname>Pendleton,
         Fredericksburg, writes on his progress as a candidate for
         Congress. Political papers of 1850 relate to the Virginia
         Constitutional Convention of 1850-1851. There are drafts of
         resolutions, February 22, 1850, by the citizens of Loudoun
         County. There is a letter, July 26, 1850, from John Janney "To
         the People of Loudoun County." A document dated October 1850
         to February 1851 includes minutes of the proceedings, the plan
         proposed, and resolutions for the Committee on the Judiciary
         of the Convention.</p>
      <p>Political letters of 1851-1852 discuss the new constitution
         and representation based different methods. On May 30, 1851, 
         <persname normal="Richard">R[ichard]</persname><persname normal="William">W[illiam]</persname>N. Noland
         (1821- ), Albemarle County, inquires about and comments on the
         defeat of the "mixed basis" in the convention. On May 31,
         1851, Janney answers Noland, giving his views on
         representation and the best method of protecting the east,
         which he believes is with a "suffrage basis," and commenting
         on [James French] Strother's motion regarding the vote. 
         <persname normal="Richard">R[ichard]</persname><persname normal="Cassius">C[assius]</persname><persname normal="Lee">L[ee]</persname>Moncure (1805-1882),
         Fredericksburg, writes on June 23, 1851, concerning the
         establishment of district courts, having an independent
         judiciary, the mode of electing appellate judges, and
         improvements needed in the jury trial in relation to the new
         constitution. On December 5, 1851, Janney writes to his fellow
         citizens about his nomination for the office of senate and
         expressing his opinions on certain matters, including the new
         constitution and representation by "mixed basis" and "white
         basis." There are letters, April 2 and 4, 1852, from John W.
         Tyler, Warrenton, concerning his election as judge of his
         judicial circuit.</p>
      <p>Political letters of 1857-1858 relate to the public land
         question, politics in general, and the University of Virginia.
         On March 28, 1857, George 
         <persname normal="Eyster">E[yster]</persname>Senseney, editor,
         Winchester Republican, refers to the public land question and
         the injustice in regard to the dispositions of the common
         domain, comments on [Charles James] Faulkner taking both sides
         of the land question in order to help his election, and
         requests to offer his name as a candidate for Congress. On
         April 3, 1857, Janney writes to Senseney, declining to be a
         candidate and commenting on the Constitutional Convention of
         Virginia 1850-1851. There is an interesting letter, April 29,
         1858, from 
         <persname normal="Valentine">V[alentine]</persname><persname normal="Wood">W[ood]</persname>Southall ( -1861),
         Charlottesville, concerning the University of Virginia. He
         comments disfavorably on the University since "the reign of
         Democratic terror commenced in Va," claims that the entire
         visitors board and faculty appear to have been selected
         because of their political opinions, mentions his disdain for
         Governor [Joseph] Johnson (1785-1877), refers to the political
         clique of "Calhoun abstractionists, fire eaters, &amp;
         disunionists," mentions the visit to the University by [ ]
         Davis and the discourteous reception which apparently led to
         the loss of a bill proposing an appropriation to the
         University, comments passionately on the deplorable state of
         public affairs, state and federal, refers to [James Buchanan
         (1791-1868)] "chief magistrate who seems but little removed
         from lunacy," and touches on other political topics. On May
         22, 1848, Southall writes about his dissatisfaction with the
         course of the Richmond Whig and its involvement in the subject
         of a revival of the African slave trade.</p>
      <p>Political letters and papers of 1860-1862 relate to the
         Union, the Constitution, and the Convention of Virginia. There
         are drafts concerning the presidential election and the
         organization of the Union Party in Loudoun County (October
         1860). There are resolutions to be laid before a meeting of
         the citizens of Loudoun County concerning issues relating to
         the Union and the Constitution, especially the fugitive slave
         laws and slavery in the new territories (November-December
         1860). There is a draft of Loudoun County resolutions
         concerning the imminent danger to the Constitution of the
         United States and the Union (1860). There is an 1861 Electoral
         Ticket for Jefferson Davis as President and Alexander H.
         Stephens as Vice-President for the Confederacy. On February
         23, 1861, [ ] Huey, Philadelphia, writes to Janney, who is
         presiding over the Virginia Convention, advising that Virginia
         must stay in the Union at all costs, expressing his belief
         that a majority of both houses of Congress and the Supreme
         Court will be in favor of the South, and inquiring as to what
         can be gained by secession that is not already secured in the
         Union. There is a copy of the March 20, 1861 Congressional
         Record "Our First Grave Constitutional Crisis 1861; Speech of
         Hon. Dale Alford." On April 18, 1861, 
         <persname normal="John">J[ohn]</persname><persname normal="Jordan">J[ordan]</persname>Crittendon
         (1787-1863), Frankfort, Kentucky, writes concerning the
         Resolution of the Convention of Virginia in appreciation of
         Crittendon's efforts in the Senate. A lengthy letter, April
         18, 1861, from Charles Cocke, Huntley, Nelson County,
         questions the outcome of the Convention of Virginia. Cocke
         writes a passionate political outpouring on the effects of
         "dissolution of the Union," including "the terrors of a civil
         strife" and "the subversion of the noblest form of
         Government." He claims that the Convention "laid down the
         principle that secession for cause, is justifiable"; comments
         on South Carolina's reasons for seceding; scoffs at the
         advocates of secession --

         good men, including John Janney, William [Cabell] Rives, and
         others; and, comments that if the "rebel states had stood
         their ground, [Abraham] Lincoln would have been in a minority
         in both Houses of Congress..." There are two letters, April 28
         and May 1, 1861, from 
         <persname normal="William Cabell Rives">W[illiam] C[abell] Rives</persname>,
         "Castle Hill," Cobham, concerning political matters. The former
         letter from Rives relays the content of two conversations with
         the vice-president of the Confederate States, [Alexander
         Hamilton] Stephens; reveals that he is pleased with "the calm
         &amp; dispassionate tone of his mind, &amp; the frankness
         &amp; sincerity with which he expressed his views"; and,
         claims that Stephens is anxious for a peaceable separation.
         The latter letter concerns Rives' appointment as one of the
         delegates to the Congress at Montgomery, and encloses a letter
         to be laid before the Convention as follows: expressing his
         acknowledgments for the honor of being elected as one of the
         Delegates of Virginia to the Congress of the Confederate
         States and regretfully declines acceptance because of his
         delicate health. Rives writes a heartfelt, patriotic letter in
         support of the Commonwealth and its decision of secession. A
         letter of May 3, 1861 from George 
         <persname normal="William">W[illiam]</persname>Summers (1804-
         1868), Kanawha Courthouse, concerns the progress of the
         Convention of Virginia; inquires about the status of Virginia
         as a Confederate State, and the possibility of a peaceable
         separation with the South acting only in defense; and, states
         the conditions in his region. On May 5, 1861, Rives writes in
         deference to the wishes and opinions expressed by Janney and
         A. H. H. Stuart that he has decided "to undertake the mission
         to Montgomery," and refers to Janney's address to General
         [Robert E.] Lee upon his appointment to the chief command of
         our military forces. A letter of June 14, 1861, from Rives
         concerns his acceptance of the duties of the appointment
         conferred upon him by the Convention. There is an August 1861
         document of the property of John Janney impressed for the use
         of the Confederate states. There is a letter [1861] "To the
         People of Loudoun" revealing thoughts on Virginia and the
         Union and the question of secession and the organization of
         the Convention of Virginia. On June 9, 1862, 
         <persname normal="Francis">F[rancis]</persname><persname normal="Harrison">H[arrison]</persname>Pierpoint
         (1814-1899), Wheeling, West Virginia, writing as provisional
         governor, indicates his desire to restore peace and order in
         Loudoun and the adjoining counties and warns that he intends
         to protect the Union men and their property, threatening to
         send away the secessionists at any sign of trouble.</p>
      <p>Political letters of 1865-1868 are chiefly between Janney
         and Alexander Hugh Holmes Stuart and concern the possibility
         of the reunion of Virginia and West Virginia. There is an
         October 11, 1865 document, "The Voter's Oath," signed by John
         Janney. On March 9, 1866, Alexander 
         <persname normal="Hugh">H[ugh]</persname><persname normal="Holmes">H[olmes]</persname>Stuart
         (1807-1891), Staunton, writes concerning his election as one
         of the commissioners to West Virginia, referring to the
         resolutions directing them to communicate with the government
         legislature of West Virginia, and indicating that a
         postponement would be best witih the commissioners meeting in
         Richmond some two or three weeks from now to confer with each
         other and with Governor [Francis Harrison] Pierpont. On March
         28, 1866, Stuart encloses a copy of a letter dated March 21st
         from Governor [Arthur Ingram] Boreman (1823-1896), Wheeling,
         West Virginia, concerning the resolutions adopted by the
         General Assembly of Virginia on the subjects of a reunion of
         the states of Virginia and West Virginia, the settlement of
         the public debt, and a division of the public property of
         Virginia as existed prior to the separation. There is a
         letter, June 19, 1866, from 
         <persname normal="Joshua">J[oshua]</persname>Francis Fisher
         (1807-1873), concerning his pamphlet ["Concessions and
         Compromises" ?] before the meeting of the South Carolina
         Convention, which showed his feelings and principles at the
         beginning of their troubles. On February 26, 1867, Stuart
         discusses their resignations and the prospect of delaying them
         until the new legislature meets and provides his impressions
         on the current political situation. A letter, June 28, 1867,
         from William Cabell Rives refers to the Trustees of the
         Peabody Fund appointment of Dr. [Barnas] Sears (1802-1880) as
         their general agent. On February 24, 1868, John Janney writes
         to R. T. Daniel concerning a political address, indicating a
         change to be made on the statement about the Convention of
         Virginia that ratified the Constitution of the United States,
         and mentioning [Robert Mercer Taliaferro] Hunter. On December
         25, 1868, Alexander Hugh Holmes Stuart writes that reports
         indicate that something must be done "to save Virginia from
         ruin," and mentions [John Brown] Baldwin (1820-1873), [John]
         Echols (1823-1896), and [ ] Sheffey, who request Janney's
         presence at a meeting in Richmond. A March 20, 1870 letter
         from Charles B. Ball, Richmond, to George N. Owing concerns
         his chances for the judgship. There are several undated
         political items, including a petition "To the Senate of the
         United States of America," by the citizens and voters of
         Philadelphia, requesting an alteration to the Constitution
         concerning representation as related to slave property. There
         are also notes: "Reasons for voting against re-eligibility in
         committee," "Subject of Guarantees" on basis and re-
         eligibility of government, and on amendments to the
         Constitution, chiefly regarding representation.</p>
      <p>There are transcripts of letters, February - April 1861,
         from John Janney to his wife, Alcinda "Alice" S. (Marmaduke)
         Janney while he is in attendance at the Convention of Virginia
         in Richmond. Although the letters are of a personal nature,
         Janney does relate his opinions and other information-- some
         confidential--about the Convention and its progress.</p>
      <p>Among John Janney's papers are correspondence and financial
         and legal papers of Solomon Parsons. There are letters,
         1810-1813, from Solomon Parsons to his wife, Harriett E.
         Parsons. On April 11, 1813, Parsons mentions Admiral [John
         Borlase] Warren (1753-1822) and his fleet being at the mouth
         of the Potomac River and refers to his insolence in sending
         his compliments to their fort. On July 19, 1813, Parsons
         writes that he believes that the British will come up as far
         as Dumfries or opposite Occoquan for water before making their
         escape back, that the town is nearly all soldiers, that he
         does not know what his part will be yet, and that more troops
         are arriving. There are letters on October 12 and December 21,
         1821, to Henry Gunnell concerning the John Coffey estate and
         its appraisal. On September 10, 1816, Jacob Parsons,
         Gloucester, writes about the failure of the tanning business,
         looking for a new livelihood, and commerce and the fisheries
         being depressed. There is a letter, February 30, 1828, from
         Gloucester, referring to the attendance of parties and balls,
         family news, religious matters, and cousin John [Janney].
         There is a June 20, 1829 letter from Baldwin Bradford,
         Warrenton, to Parsons, concerning an enclosed letter dictated
         and marked by an African-American woman, Nancy Jackson,
         requesting another African-American woman, Patsy Johnson, to
         give ten dollars to Solomon Parsons after her death. It notes
         that Samuel Johnson, husband of Patsy Johnson, is a free black
         man who lives with Bradford. The enclosure, February 9, 1829,
         [Nancy Jackson] to "Dear Master" states her intentions.
         Letters of July 14 and July 18, 1829 between Parsons and
         Thomas W. Hewitt concern the John Coffey estate and an inquiry
         into the sale of the slaves and whether or not they brought as
         much as they were worth. There is a letter, July 25, 1829,
         from 
         <persname normal="Mordecai">Mord[ecai]</persname>Miller,
         Alexandria, in which he advises one Sibblefield not to give up
         the rifles to the government. On September 13, 1829, Jacob
         Parsons, Gloucester, writes to his brother, commenting on
         their having similar views on religious subjects yet such
         differing views on political and commercial topics. On
         September 24, 1829, 
         <persname normal="Anthony">A[nthony]</persname>P. Gover,

         Alexandria, concern the books, James Fenimore Cooper's Works
         and Ivanhoe [by Sir Walter Scott]. Gover also writes on
         December 17, 1829, about the speculation in wharf property and
         the establishment of a foundry and a new ferry in Alexandria.
         There are interesting letters, October - November 1829, from
         Fanny B. B. Wilson, "Happy Retreat," Occoquan, to her brother,
         Solomon Parsons, as a widow with several small children
         attempting to settle the estate of her late husband, Richard
         Wilson. She discusses options for making a living such as
         working part of the farm; the Sheriff calling for a fee bill
         and taxes and taking her horse, which she hired out for money
         to buy bread, when she could not pay; the tenant on the
         Lindsay farm not paying rent; and problems with settling the
         estate and its outstanding debts. She also lists the names of
         her six children. Letters of January 12 and March 3, 1830,
         from J. D. Parsons, Charleston, South Carolina, to his brother
         chiefly concern business and mention brother Samuel losing his
         office, his own business being in much confusion, the
         bankruptcy of a former commercial debtor and ensuing financial
         problems, and mercantile, agricultural and mechanical
         operations, and the improvement in business by March. On
         January 17, 1830, Jacob Parsons, Gloucester, writes about a
         shipment of a keg of mackerel and there being no sale for fish
         except mackerel; he also "hopes that Congress will do
         something toward removing the shackles from commerce" and
         gives his views on how to maintain a healthy commerce. A
         letter of February 1, 1830 discusses business progress at
         Occoquan, mentioning John Morgan selling a great many goods,
         the factory being in full operation, some thirty good looking
         and well-dressed girls being well broken in to the business,
         several houses being built, and the village needing a tailor
         and a shoemaker. He also mentions freight voyages to St.
         Thomas, Brazil, and St. Domingo and the effect of the
         Temperance Society around Alexandria. A letter of March 17,
         1830, from Thomas Love, Lebanon, [Ohio], gives a description
         of the geography of Fairfield, Ohio and surrounding land and
         waterways; and, mentions various newspapers published in Ohio,
         the Message from the President [Andrew Jackson], and the

         two assistants are absent, alternate rains and sunshine
         yielding the farmers a large return, and business affairs.

      <p>Letters, 1886-1920, to Thomas Gordon Janney, are chiefly
