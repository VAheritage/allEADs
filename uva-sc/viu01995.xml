            <p>Says that the recent elections has made him
                  ashamed of New England, "that patriotism which
                  animated our fathers in the revolution has fled to
                  the backwoods of Kentucky and Ohio," disagrees with
                  the contention that the election of DeWitt Clinton
                  would bring peace, and promises "Fear not
                  Massachusetts - and her satellites - she is almost
                  ashamed to see you carry on the war without her.
                  Forty thousand of her sons have not yet bowed the
                  knee to Baal" (1812 Nov 23); while news of the
                  disaster concerning the forces of James Winchester on
                  the frontier was a terrible blow, he is encouraged by
                  news of the destruction of the British frigate Java
                  (1813 Feb 18); describes a large Republican
                  convention at Alfred, Maine, and welcomes news of the
                  victory of the U.S. Hornet over the British ship The
                  Peacock (1813 Mar 25); mentions the American
                  victories at York (present-day Toronto) and Fort
                  Meigs, and admits to being open to an appointment if
                  his abilities are needed (1813 Jun 2 &amp; 15); and
                  discusses the estate of Foxwell Cutts (1817 Apr
