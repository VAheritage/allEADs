      <p>In the first letter, Robert Penn Warren writes to Douglas
         Newton on July 13, 1944, responding to a query from Newton re
         several possibilities for publishing some of his work. First,
         he agrees to submit material to an anthology of English and
         American writing; asks about the kind and length of material
         needed; explains that he does not have much new material
         because he is writing a long novel and a narrative poem
         similar in form to "Billie Potts" in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Selected Poems</title>, which he would
         like to publish with James Laughlin; mentions a narrative
         piece to be published in the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Partisan Review</title>and later
         included in the novel; and offers to send a copy. Second, he
         describes a proposed collection of previously published
         stories, some of which appeared in anthologies like O'Henry
         and O'Brien; asks for advice about book publication at
         Newton's company; mentions that Fortune's Press expressed
         interest in publishing his poems in England; explains he may
         approach them about the stories but is not optimistic; and
         says Newton is welcome to use any he wants. Third, he
         discusses poems Newton chose for a collection of American
         poetry for Penguin books; says they are closer to him at the
         moment than any others except the group on Mexico and "Billie
         Potts"; and explains that Newton will need reprint permission
         from Harcourt, Brace and Company, who recently published his 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Selected Poems</title>.</p>
      <p>The second letter, May 28, 1960, is from Robert Penn Warren
         to Clifton Waller Barrett, to whom he sends regrets that he
         will not be able to attend a reception for Robert Frost and
         Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant.</p>
