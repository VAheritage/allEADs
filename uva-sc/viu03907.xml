      <head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Mattie T. Shackleford, was a resident of Gloucester County, Virginia, a member of the University of Virginia Base Hospital 41 in World War I, and a nurse in the American Red Cross. She graduated from the Protestant Hospital of New York and worked as a Superintendent. In 1914 she volunteered for the American Red Cross and promoted their chapters. She was also a nurse instructor to both white and African American students. In 1918 she was called into service at Camp McClellan and sailed overseas as a member of the Base Hospital 41, University of Virginia. After the war, she worked for the Serbian Relief Committee of America as a nurse and a lieutenant. Two of her sisters were Nellie Shackleford Smith and Mary Henri Mattox who were both teachers. Their mother was affiliated with a pediatric hospital and may have also been a nurse. Nellie married Charles S. Smith Jr. who grew up in Gloucester, Virginia and became an attorney. They had two children Nellie Shackleford Smith and Charles S. Smith III.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The collection consists of ca. 489 items, 3 hollinger boxes, 1.5 linear feet and contains letters written by Mattie T. Shackleford, a resident of Gloucester County, Virginia who served as a nurse with the American Red Cross in France in 1917-1922 during World War I. After the war, Shackleford served in Serbia and then resided in Tarboro, North Carolina and continued to work for the American Red Cross.
</p>
      <p>
The collection also includes correspondence of Charles S. Smith, Jr., and his family. Smith was an attorney and the husband of Mattie T. Shackleford's sister, Nellie Shackleford Smith. The Smith family lived in Gloucester, and Mathews, Virginia until they later moved to Saluda, Virginia.  These family letters constitute a major part of the collection. The letters span from 1899 to 1948.  
</p>
      <p>
Early letters in the collection reflect Mattie Shackleford's work in France and Serbia. She often described to her sister, Nellie, the poverty-stricken conditions of the children that she was treating. There is also information about World War I, the abdication of the Kaiser, and the surrender of a German U-boat [1918].  
</p>
      <p>
Most of the letters of the Smith family are personal in nature and describe local news as well as concerns for each member of the family. Mattie Shackleford, Nellie Smith, and Mary Henri Mattox were sisters and were characterized as having strong opinions and nervous conditions. Mary Henry Mattox was sent to the Tucker [Sanatorium] and often wrote about her desire for a divorce from her husband. Both Mattie Shackleford as a nurse and Nellie Smith as a teacher were independent women with important careers.
</p>
      <p>
Education played a major role in the lives of the Smith family. Their son, Charles Smith III attended Wake Forest [1932] and their daughter, Nellie Shackleford Smith attended the Richmond Division of William and Mary College [1935]. Both children seemed to struggle with finding good careers after school. Charles Smith III worked at a bank, and then as a taxi cab driver. Nellie Shackleford Smith took courses that seem to indicate she wanted to be a nurse but the correspondence reveals that she struggled with her coursework in the sciences.
</p>
      <p>
There are references to members of the family coming down with the "grippe" and "influenza." There are also concerns about eating healthy foods and black markets, particularly regarding meat and shortages of sugar.
