      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>William Homer Wisely (1906-1982) was born in Coulterville,
         Illinois. He married Hazel A. Steinburg in 1930, and they had
         two children, Janet Lee and Nancy Ann. Wisely received his
         B.S. in Engineering from the University of Illinois in 1928
         and pursued graduate studies in Civil Engineering there until
         1941. Subsequently, he received his doctorate in Engineering
         from Norwich University (1967). While an undergraduate, he
         worked as an assistant engineer for the Illinois Walter Survey
         (1926-1928). After graduation he was hired by the Illinois
         Department of Public Health (1928-1940) as an assistant
         sanitary engineer and later became the engineering manager for
         the Urbana-Champaign Sanitary district (1940-1944). He was the
         Commissioner of the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation
         Commission from 1952-1954.</p>
      <p>Wisely was a director, fellow, and honorary member of
         numerous national and international engineering societies,
         including the American Society of Civil Engineering (ASCE),
         the United Engineering Trustees, Inc. (1960-1972), Chi
         Epsilon, and the World Federation of Engineering Organizations
         (WFEO), for which he chaired the International Organizing
         Committee. He was a visiting scholar at the University of
         Florida from 1972-1978 and a visiting scholar at the
         University of Virginia from 1978-1982. His professional
         writings included numerous articles and editorials as well as
         several monographs, including 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The American Civil Engineer
         1852-1974</title>.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The William Homer Wisely Papers comprise approximately
         2,600 items (4.5 shelf feet) and include professional
         correspondence; drafts of speeches and books; reports,
         articles and notes relating to environmental conservation, the
         engineering profession, and urban planning; documents of
         engineering societies; and pedagogical materials. Various
         published items found with these materials, both monographs
         and serials, have been transferred to the University of
         Virginia Science and Engineering Library (see Appendix).</p>
      <p>The majority of Wisely's correspondence concerns the
         formation of a new world engineering society ultimately known
         as the World Federation of Engineering Organizations. Also
         included in the correspondence are comments by his colleagues
         on the professional literature, including Wisely's own
         editorials and speeches, and responses to surveys and
         questionnaires on ethics. Among the writings are speeches and
         editorials by Wisely and others on the engineering profession,
         ethics and environmental conservation, as well as copies of
         the newsletter 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Digester</title>and drafts of a
         book on the history of the ASCE from 1852-1974. A list of
         Wisely's publications appears in the "Offprints" folder.</p>
      <p>The research materials include articles and notes on the
         High Aswan Dam, ethics, engineering, solid waste management,
         water pollution control (including documentation of European
         conferences held in 1954), the population explosion, and urban
         growth. The teaching materials include lectures and handouts
         on similar topics.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement>
      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>The collection is organized into five series. The first of
         these, Correspondence (1958-1980), is arranged
         chronologically. Series II, Writings, contains drafts and
         notes for 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">the American Civil Engineer 1852-
         1974</title>, copies of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Digester</title>, a newsletter that
         Wisely edited, and correspondence related to that publication;
         offprints of articles and addresses by Wisely; and writings by
         others, arranged alphabetically by author. Series III,
         Research Files, includes mainly magazine articles and
         newspaper clippings. The file on ethics contains ethical
         canons for various professions and societies. Series IV
         consists of minutes, pamphlets, and newsletters of various
         engineering societies. The ASCE material contains editorials
         by Wisely which are arranged by date. The ASCE correspondence
         has been removed from this series and placed in Series I.
         Series V, Teaching Materials, is composed of course outlines,
         lecture notes, handouts, and exams from courses taught both at
         the University of Virginia and also the University of
         Florida.</p>
      <p>Headings Wisely assigned to his files have been retained
         when possible: High Aswan Dam, Ethics, Engineering,
         Engineering as a Profession, Environmental
         Conservation-General, Solid Waste Management, Water Pollution
         Control, Urban Planning, Slums, Case Histories, New Towns, CE
         492, ENGR 531, Speech Materials, Editorials, ASCE, ASCE
         History, Conference of Engineering Societies of Western Europe
         and the United States of America (EUSEC), Panamerican
         Federation of Engineering Societies (UPADI), and WFEO. Other
         headings have been added as necessary to refine the original
         arrangement.</p>
