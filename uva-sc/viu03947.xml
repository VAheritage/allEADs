</head>
      <p>Born January 19, 1809, in Boston, Mass.; died from complications related to a brain lesion, October 7, 1849, in Baltimore, Md.; buried in Westminster Presbyterian Churchyard, Baltimore; son of David, Jr. (a
lawyer-turned actor; died 1811) and Elizabeth (an English actress; maiden name, Arnold; died 1811) Poe; unofficially adopted, 1811, by John (a tobacco merchant) and Frances Allan; married Virginia Clemm (a
cousin), May 16, 1836 (died, 1847). Education: Attended Manor House School, Stoke Newington, England, 1815-20, University of Virginia, 1826, and United States Military Academy at West Point, 1830-31.
</p>
      <p>Novelist, critic, short story writer, and poet. Southern Literary Messenger, Richmond, Va., staff member, 1835-36, assistant editor, 1836-37; Burlington Gentleman's Magazine, Philadelphia, PA, co-editor, 1839-
40; Graham's Lady's and Gentleman's Magazine, literary editor, 1841-42; Evening Mirror, New York City, staff member, 1845; Broadway Journal, editor and owner, 1845-46. Military service: Enlisted in the United
States Army under name Edgar A. Perry, 1827; became regimental sergeant-major, 1829; discharged, 1829.
</p>
      <p>First prize (fiction), Baltimore Saturday Visiter [sic], 1833, for "MS. Found in a Bottle"; first prize (fiction), Philadelphia Dollar Newspaper, 1843, for "The Gold Bug."
</p>
      <p>Poe's stature as a major figure in world literature is primarily based on his ingenious and profound short stories, poems, and critical theories, which established a highly influential rationale for the short
form in both poetry and fiction. Regarded in literary histories and handbooks as the architect of the modern short story, Poe was also the principal forerunner of the "art for art's sake" movement in nineteenth-
century European literature. Whereas earlier critics predominantly concerned themselves with moral or ideological generalities, Poe focused his criticism on the specifics of style and construction that contributed
to a work's effectiveness or failure. In his own work, he demonstrated a brilliant command of language and technique as well as an inspired and original imagination. Poe's poetry and short stories greatly
influenced the French Symbolists of the late nineteenth century, who in turn altered the direction of modern literature. It is this philosophical and artistic transaction that accounts for much of Poe's importance
in literary history.
</p>
      <p>Poe's father and mother were professional actors who at the time of his birth were members of a repertory company in Boston. Before Poe was three years old both of his parents died, and he was raised in the
home of John Allan, a prosperous exporter from Richmond, Virginia, who never legally adopted his foster son. As a boy, Poe attended the best schools available, and was admitted to the University of Virginia at
Charlottesville in 1825. While there he distinguished himself academically but was forced to leave after less than a year because of bad debts and inadequate financial support from Allan. Poe's relationship with
Allan disintegrated upon his return to Richmond in 1827, and soon after Poe left for Boston, where he enlisted in the army and also published his first poetry collection, Tamerlane, and Other Poems. The volume
went unnoticed by readers and reviewers, and a second collection, Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems, received only slightly more attention when it appeared in 1829. That same year Poe was honorably discharged
from the army, having attained the rank of regimental sergeant major, and was then admitted to the United States Military Academy at West Point. However, because Allan would neither provide his foster son with
sufficient funds to maintain himself as a cadet nor give the consent necessary to resign from the Academy, Poe gained a dismissal by ignoring his duties and violating regulations. He subsequently went to New York
City, where Poems, his third collection of verse, was published in 1831, and then to Baltimore, where he lived at the home of his aunt, Mrs. Maria Clemm.
</p>
      <p>Over the next few years Poe's first short stories appeared in the Philadelphia Saturday Courier and his "MS. Found in a Bottle" won a cash prize for best story in the Baltimore Saturday Visitor. Nevertheless,
Poe was still not earning enough to live independently, nor did Allan's death in 1834 provide him with a legacy. The following year, however, his financial problems were temporarily alleviated when he accepted an
editorship at The Southern Literary Messenger in Richmond, bringing with him his aunt and his twelve-year-old cousin Virginia, whom he married in 1836. The Southern Literary Messenger was the first of several
journals Poe would direct over the next ten years and through which he rose to prominence as a leading man of letters in America. Poe made himself known not only as a superlative author of poetry and fiction, but
also as a literary critic whose level of imagination and insight had hitherto been unapproached in American literature.
</p>
      <p>While Poe's writings gained attention in the late 1830s and early 1840s, the profits from his work remained meager, and he supported himself by editing Burton's Gentleman's Magazine and Graham's Magazine in
Philadelphia and the Broadway Journal in New York City. After his wife's death from tuberculosis in 1847, Poe became involved in a number of romantic affairs. It was while he prepared for his second marriage that
Poe, for reasons unknown, arrived in Baltimore in late September of 1849. On October 3, he was discovered in a state of semi-consciousness; he died four days later without regaining the necessary lucidity to
explain what had happened during the last days of his life.
