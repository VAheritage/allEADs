      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This addition to the papers of the 
         <famname>Duke family</famname>of 
         <geogname>Charlottesville, Virginia</geogname>, consists of
         twenty-one items, 1836, and 1865-1919, chiefly the
         correspondence of Colonel 
         <persname>Richard Thomas Walker Duke</persname>and his son,
         Judge 
         <persname>Richard Thomas Walker Duke, Jr.</persname></p>
      <p>One letter to Col. Duke (February 6, 1865) from 
         <persname>W. F. Alexander</persname>, concerns the claim of
         the 
         <corpname>Albemarle Poor House</corpname>for wood used by the
         Confederate troops while encamped upon land adjacent to their
         property. There are four letters from Col. Duke to his wife, 
         <persname>Elizabeth Eskridge Duke</persname>, written while he
         was a prisoner of war on 
         <geogname>Johnson's Island</geogname>, a Union prison camp at 
         <geogname>Sandusky Bay, Lake Erie</geogname>, for Confederate
         officers. Col. Duke was sent there after being captured on
         April 6, 1865 at 
         <geogname>Sayler's Creek.</geogname></p>
      <p>Duke reports that the prisoners of war received good
         treatment from General 
         <persname>Ulysses S. Grant</persname>'s men, who divided their
         rations with them and did not submit them to taunts or insults
         during the march north, and he also mentions that the living
         conditions of the prison itself were quite bearable (April 20,
         1865).</p>
      <p>In a later letter (June 9, 1865), he asks his wife to write
         a letter to President 
         <persname>Andrew Johnson</persname>for his release as all
         officers above the rank of major will be released only upon
         special application. He tells her to bring up several points
         in her petition: 1) he is needed at home to provide for her
         and their children, 2) he has no influential friends to work
         on his behalf to secure his release, 3) he is opposed to
         guerilla war and he refused to allow his son William to join 
         <corpname>John Singleton Mosby's Raiders</corpname>.</p>
      <p>Duke reports the release of all prisoners below the rank of
         major and again requests his wife's aid in securing a special
         release for himself. In this letter (June 10, 1865), he
         suggests that she write to General Grant telling him that
         their income is limited, he is needed at home, she will be
         responsible for his good behavior, he is opposed to guerilla
         war, and that he applied on April 25 to take the amnesty oath.
         In addition, he tells her to go to the commander of the
         Federal forces in 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>and ask him to write to
         General Grant to secure a release for him based on character
         references from leading citizens of 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>. Col. 
         <persname>R. T. W. Duke</persname>also furnishes a detailed
         description of the 
         <geogname>Johnson's Island</geogname>prison and the place of
         confinement called the "Bull pen", mentioning the gardens of
         some of the officers, the rations of bread, meat, salt, soap,
         beans, and hominy, and the presence of a sutter and his store
         in the pen.</p>
      <p>In the fourth letter, he writes concerning the decision of
         his former slave 
         <persname>Jane</persname>to leave the Duke farm before his
         return home, and he tells his wife to get the others to stay
         on until he can negotiate their hire (June 29, 1865).</p>
      <p>Other family letters include one from Col. Duke to his son,
         <persname>R. T. W. Duke, Jr.</persname>describing a fierce
         political vote in the 
         <corpname>Virginia General Assembly</corpname>during the
         readjuster controversy (January 25, 1880), and letters from 
         <persname>Mary Duke</persname>, 
         <persname>Eskridge Duke</persname>, 
         <persname>Walker Duke</persname>, and 
         <persname>Jack Duke</persname>concerning family news.</p>
      <p>Letters from 
         <persname>John Singleton Mosby</persname>to 
         <persname>R.T.W. Duke, Jr.</persname>written while Mosby was
         employed for the 
         <corpname>United States Justice Department</corpname>contain
         the following topics: Mosby calls the attempt to blame 
         <persname>James Ewell Brown Stuart</persname>for the
         Confederate defeat at the Battle of 
         <geogname>Gettysburg</geogname>as "one of the greatest crimes
         in history" (April 17, 1908); Mosby discourses on his great
         distaste for the "profession" of football in the universities
         and argues that "it is more talked about at the University
         than literature or science"; he bemoans the irony that
         "Cockfighting is a criminal offense in Virginia but killing a
         man at football is not" (December 1, 1909); and he speaks with
         pleasure of his reception at the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>and in 
         <geogname>Albemarle County</geogname>(May 10, 1915).</p>
      <p>Other printed or miscellaneous items include an invitation
         to the inauguaration of 
         <persname>Edwin A. Alderman</persname>as president of the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>on April 13, 1905;
         a postcard picture of Confederate veterans taken at the
         unveiling of the 
         <corpname>Confederate Soldier's Monument</corpname>at 
         <corpname>Buckingham Court House</corpname>on June 30, 1908,
         which included 
         <persname>R. T. W. Duke, Jr.</persname>; and the British
         Identity Book issued to 
         <persname>R. T. W. Duke, Jr.</persname>on February 5,
         1919.</p>
