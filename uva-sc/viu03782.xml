      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection consists of papers and diaries of Robert Larimer, who was born in Perry County, Ohio, in 1841, and left his farm there to serve in Co. C., 62nd Regiment, Ohio infantry, during the Civil War.
</p>
      <p>The first diary (1862 December 31 to 1863 December 1) describes his service in the Union army; camp life; and the seige of Charleston (1863) including bombardment of Morris Island and the attack on Ft. Wagner;
Springfield rifles' target practice and boat drills; and voting for pro-Union candidates. The second diary (1865 January 1 to December 3) describes the siege of Richmond; the hanging of deserters; reviews by Union
Generals and President Lincoln; capture of Fort Gregg, Va.; the Appomattox Campaign and surrender; visits to Richmond, Va. and duties until mustered out; his captain's mugging; visit to a "photograph gallery", and
purchasing land in Minnesota under the Homestead Law. There are scattered references to freed slaves and African-American troops.
</p>
      <p>The papers also contain military records including discharges, appointments, and special orders; a list, 1865, of contributors to a fund to buy a sword and watch for the captains; three newspaper clippings and
a railroad ticket. Of interest is a treatise "The slaveholders' rebellion" giving detailed accounts from November 10 1860 to January 5 1861, of activities in the South with a conclusion condemning the rebellion on
moral grounds. General John Gibbon is a correspondent.
