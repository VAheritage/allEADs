      <p>The letters from 1943 begin on September 7, when Pemstein
         is beginning his six week course at Hospital School at the
         U.S. Naval Hospital, at Portsmouth, Virginia. In these
         letters, he mentions a terrible explosion near Portsmouth,
         Virginia, and his tour of the aircraft carrier 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Block Island</title>and the cruiser 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Baltimore</title>(Sep 18, 21); his
         plans to try and go to the Navy embalming school (Sep 2[?]);
         and his assignment to Key West, in which he comments that 27
         out of the 31 soldiers in his group sent to the hospital at
         Key West, Florida, were Jewish (Oct 14-15). Apparently the
         letters from Key West to Massachusetts are missing and they
         are not part of this collection.</p>
      <p>Letters from 1944 do not begin until August 17, when
         Pemstein is in Norfolk, Virginia, after traveling from Miami,
         where he is working in sick bay as a pharmacist's mate until
         his crew is formed for a ship being constructed in Orange,
         Texas. In these letters, he writes that he is unimpressed by 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Farewell to Arms</title>by Ernest
         Hemingway (Aug 27); one contains a report sent to his parents
         from the Jewish Social Services Agency (Aug); his luck in not
         having to stand watch, be on cleaning detail, march, or train
         with the men because he works at the dispensary, and his
         disappointment that there will not be any leave for the
         upcoming Jewish holy days (Sep 3); his crew will have 147 men
         and 6 officers (Sep 6); description of a hurricane in progress
         (Sep 14); description of his experiences and activities during
         the Jewish holy day services (Sep 21, 29); leaving for a week
         afloat at sea, before they transfer to Orange, Texas, to go
         aboard the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">U.S.S. French</title>(Sep 25); and
         leaving Norfolk (Sep 29).</p>
      <p>After Pemstein leaves Norfolk, Virginia, on September 29,
         1944, he describes Orange, Texas, where his ship will soon be
         commissioned (Oct 4); his ship leaving for Bermuda, and then
         Boston (Oct 24); and his tendency to purchase tobacco pipes
         while in various ports (Dec 19).</p>
      <p>During letters written in 1945 Jan-Sep, Pemstein mentions
         going through the Panama Canal (Jan 3); his adventures in
         trying to bring medical supplies aboard ship (Feb 12); his
         belief that the war in the Pacific will end before the one in
         Europe (Feb 20); his opportunities to learn about medicine and
         his reading (Feb 21); being at Pearl Harbor (Feb 28);
         description of experiences on several South Pacific islands,
         including Saipan and Palau (Apr 2); his whole division moving
         towards Japan, his worries that Japan will be trouble because
         it was not invaded before its surrender (Aug 23); the
         abolition of censorship, his ship at Okinawa, anchored at
         Buckner Bay, description of his difficulty with green officers
         and their attitude (Sep 7); leaving for southern Japan to
         retrieve American prisoners of war, unable to go ashore to
         participate in Rosh Hashana services, description of the
         routine of his easy life aboard ship, discussion of the

         prisoners of war, and Japanese civilians asking for cigarettes
         (Sep 13); after leaving Wakayama, his ship escorted an APD
         carrying mostly Japanese and Dutch prisoners to Guam, many
         other prisoners had died from dysentery and lack of medical
         attention, their efforts to prevent disease from Wakayama
         spreading to the ships, and encountering a typhoon during Yom
         Kippur (Sep 19); their return to Wakayama from Guam and
         watching movies every night (Sep 24); and his description of
