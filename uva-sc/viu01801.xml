        <p>This accession was made a gift to the Library on
            February 9, 1987, by Alexander Gordon Gilliam, Jr., Office
            of the President, University of Virginia. There are no
            restrictions on the material.</p>

      <p>This collection contains twenty items: six letters, 1934,
         concerning fund raising for the Omicron Chapter of Beta Theta
         Pi at the University of Virginia; and, fourteen letters,
         1925-1931, from Alexander Gordon Gilliam, while a student at
         the University, to his brother, Richard Davenport Gilliam,
         Jr.</p>
      <p>During 1934, the Omicron Chapter of Beta Theta Pi was faced
         with a severe financial situation. Edward M. Hudgins,
         President of the Chapter, contacted the members of their
         Alumni Committee on Chapter Finance, explained the situation
         and sought the members' assistance in obtaining contributions.
         The resulting correspondence is concerned with raising funds
         for the Chapter.</p>
      <p>Alexander Gordon Gilliam's letters from the University
         reveal his deep respect and affection for the school, not only
         through his personal thoughts but also by his willingness to
         organize fellow students in a united cause. While working
         toward his B.A. in Biology, he wrote his brother about bids to
         Phi Beta Kappa and the Raven Society, an address given by John
         Powell to the Anglo-Saxon Club in May 1925, and his being one
         of four chosen to represent the University in the applications
         for the Rhodes Scholarships. On June 6, 1925, he wrote an
         interesting letter expounding his beliefs toward public
         drunkenness--its causes and consequences, the advantages of
         exposure to "liberal thought and culture," and the promotion
         of individualism in University men. Persons mentioned include
         Southgate Leigh, Julien Green, Armistead Boothe, Hill Carter,
         and C. Venable Minor.</p>
      <p>After graduation in June 1926, Gilliam travelled to China
         and taught at St. John's in Shanghai for a year. In the fall
         of 1927, he returned to Charlottesville and entered the
         University's Medical School. His correspondence with his
         brother continued, and an exchange between them in November
         1929 discussed the ideal of the "Virginia Spirit." There are
         also references to "gumming sessions" concerned with the
         changing University and methods of effecting a smooth
         transition.</p>
