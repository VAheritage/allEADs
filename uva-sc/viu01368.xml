      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of 7 (seven) items: a diary (May
         4--June 20, 1864) and letter (October 23, 1864) of William
         Johnston (December 9, 1839--May 23, 1916) of Waterloo,
         Michigan, a Union Army soldier stationed in Virginia during
         the Civil War while a member of Co. K, 8th Michigan Volunteer
         Infantry. The diary summarizes the regiment's participation in
         battles and skirmishes during the Union's Army of the
         Potomac's 1864 spring campaign against the Confederacy's Army
         of Northern Virginia (the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court
         House, North Anna River, Cold Harbor, and Petersburg) which
         eventually culminated in the siege and capture of Petersburg
         and Richmond. His letter (with envelope) is addressed to his
         future wife, Miss Sarah Ann Wicks (May 8, 1841--May 21, 1911),
         also of Waterloo, in which he discusses camp life and personal
         matters.¹ Also present are five electrostatic
         copies of genealogical, marriage and birth information (from a
         family bible?) concerning the Johnston and related families
         and, a poem (published) "To The Gallant Eighth, Of
         Michigan."</p>
      <p>The 8th Michigan was formed and organized at Grand Rapids
         in August 1861 and mustered into federal service at Fort
         Wayne, Detroit, in September 1861. Subsequent to the events
         discussed in Johnston's diary it saw combat in Kentucky,
         Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. During
         the period covered by the diary the regiment was part of the
         First Brigade, 1st Division, 9th Army Corps, Army of the
         Potomac. 
         <emph render="super">2</emph></p>
      <p>After June 20, 1864 (Johnston's final diary entry) the 8th
         Michigan continued to participate in the Army of the Potomac's
         siege of Petersburg and was among Union forces which finally
         occupied the city in April 1865. The regiment was mustered out
         in July 1865. According to the marriage certificate, Johnston
         and Sarah Ann Weeks were married on February 13, 1865, in
         Jackson County. Michigan. As of 1892 William Johnston was a
         resident of Bunker Hill, Michigan.
