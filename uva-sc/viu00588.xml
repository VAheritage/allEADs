      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists of four letters from 
         <persname>Thomas Mayburry</persname>, manager of the 
         <corpname>Etna Furnace</corpname>, 
         <geogname>Pattonsburg, Botetourt County, Virginia</geogname>,
         to his partner 
         <persname>William Weaver</persname>(1780-1863) a merchant of 
         <geogname>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</geogname>, who became
         one of the most prominent and successful ironmasters in the 
         <geogname>Valley of Virginia</geogname>. These letters
         complement the Weaver-Brady Papers which contain eighty
         volumes of the 
         <corpname>Weaver-Brady Iron Works and Grist
         Mill</corpname>Records, 1825-1878, and other financial papers.
         This correspondence was apparently written about seven years
         before Weaver came to 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>to supervise his Iron Works
         directly.</p>
      <p>In the earliest letter, February 4, 1816, Mayburry
         furnishes a report on the operation of the blast furnace at 
         <geogname>Pattonsburg</geogname>which he claims would be as
         good as one in 
         <geogname>Pennsylvania</geogname>if he only had enough black
         laborers, inquires of the market for pig and bar iron in 
         <geogname>Philadelphia</geogname>and 
         <geogname>New York</geogname>, asks Weaver's advice on the
         best place to sell pig iron, gives his opinion that furnaces
         where the ore banks are good and convenient are the best and
         most profitable property for an investor, mentions that Mr.
         Wilson's property on the river is for sale, and discusses the
         impossiblility of continuing to plan for a rolling mill that
         year unless Weaver could send him several good forgemen.</p>
      <p>The second letter, March 3, 1816, reports that 
         <corpname>Etna Furnace</corpname>produced 260 tons of iron in
         fourteen weeks, discusses the difficulty in securing a market
         for the pig iron produced at 
         <corpname>Etna Furnace</corpname>, mentions how brisk a trade
         item that the bar iron was at 
         <geogname>Lynchburg</geogname>, mentions progress at 
         <geogname>Retreat</geogname>and how the rolling mill if built
         could create a market for the iron at home.</p>
      <p>Mayburry also requests the hiring of two good refiners,
         hopes that the furnace at 
         <geogname>Retreat</geogname>will blow on the morrow, reports a
         break-in and theft at the store, sends an inventory of goods
         needed for the store, notes that Wilson has not yet received
         the patent for his land and discusses the arrangements to
         secure the property, March 31, 1816.</p>
      <p>In the last letter, he begs Weaver to keep the sale of pig
         iron in mind, again expresses his frustration at the
         difficulty of hiring enough black laborers for the needs of
         the furnace, reports that the furnace is still blowing, agrees
         with Weaver about the advantage of running a rolling mill but
         feels that it is not yet possible, mentions Mr. Moore's
         property, located eight miles north of 
         <geogname>Lexington</geogname>on the 
         <geogname>North River</geogname>, as a good place to extend
         their iron works since it already had the dam and race
         complete with a forge partially built, and would have water
         carriage to their 
         <corpname>Union Forge</corpname>. Mayburry proposes to
         establish at that location a forge, rolling mill, saw and
         grist mill, and a furnace if they can secure the property.</p>
