      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 137 items, 1910-1978,
         papers of Charles William Smith, artist and professor emeritus
         of art at the University of Virginia. Smith was born in
         Lofton, Virginia, in 1893. He attended summer art courses at
         the University of Virginia in 1911 and later became an art
         student at the Corcoran Gallery of Art and at the Yale School
         of Fine Arts, returning to the University of Virginia each
         year to teach in the summer session. Following the first World
         War, he pursued a career as a graphic artist, first in
         Waynesboro, Virginia, and then in New York City, making
         woodblock prints for book illustrations and advertisements,
         publishing books of his blockprints, and a book about linoleum
         print making, and all the while continuing with his painting
         and drawing. In 1936 he left New York to teach at Bennington
         College in Vermont, where he developed his technique of making
         "block paintings," as he called them, using movable blocks of
         wood and linoleum and strips of metal to print the abstract
         and geometric shapes which formed his compositions. Each
         impression was made separately, and each painting was
         therefore unique. Smith taught at the University of Virginia
         from 1948-1963, and was head of the art department for the
         last eleven years of his tenure.</p>
      <p>Included in the collection are letters from artists such as
         Charles Dana Gibson, Maxfield Parrish, Vasili Kandinsky,
         Reginald Marsh, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Dard Hunter, Fred O. Seibel,
         Rudolph Rusicka, and Jean Helion, as well as prominent art
         world figures Herbert Read, Lewis Mumford, Elmer Adler,
         Baroness Hilda Rebay, and Leslie Cheek. Many of the business
         letters are from organizations such as the Solomon R.
         Guggenheim Foundation and from art institutions such as the
         Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Modern Art in New
         York and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Personal material
         from Smith's war career can also be found in the collection,
         as well as newsclippings, certificates and photographs
         concerning his work as an artist and teacher.</p>
