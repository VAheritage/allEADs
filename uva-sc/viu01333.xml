      <p>The 1st New York Engineers was initially organized in New
         York City during 1861 but some of its companies were organized
         in New Jersey and Pennsylvania during 1862-1864. In December
         1861 the regiment was sent to Washington and then to Fortress
         Monroe in Hampton Roads, Virginia. It was assigned to forces
         under General Thomas Sherman for an expedition under the
         command of Admiral Samuel F. DuPont for Port Royal Sound,
         South Carolina, and became the 10th Corps Engineers in the
         Department of the South. The regiment served in Union
         campaigns in South Carolina and Georgia during 1862-64.
         Transferred to Virginia in April 1864, it participated in the
         major campaigns of the Army of the James and the Army of the
         Potomac, 1864-65, resulting in the capture of Petersburg and
         Richmond in April 1865. As part of the engineer corps of the
         Army of the James, the 1st New York Engineers constructed the
         Bermuda Hundred Line, laid miles of corduroy roads, operated
         an engineer depot, and constructed the Dutch Gap Canal. The
         regiment built fortifications and roads that contributed to
         the ultimate victory of the Army of the Potomac. Its companies
         were separately mustered out on June 29, 1865. Hotchkin's New
         York home is unknown; his regiment included men from sixteen
         New York counties (Allegany, Clinton, Columbia, Dutchess,
         Greene, Kings, Monroe, New York, Ontario, Orange, Oswego,
         Otsego, Putnam, Rockland, Ulster, and Westchester) and New
         Jersey and Pennsylvania.¹</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>These two Civil War pocket diaries, 1864 and 1865, of a
         Union soldier, Williams S. Hotchkin, Company E, 1st Regiment
         New York Engineers ["1st Regiment New York Volunteers
         (Engineers)," "First New York Regiment of Engineers
         (Veteran)," "New York Volunteer Corps Engineers," "Serrell's
         Engineers"] includes daily entries from September 15, 1864 to
         July 15, 1865. According to the 1864 volume's flyleaf,
         Hotchkin enlisted on August 30, 1864. During the period
         covered by these diaries his regiment served in Virginia
         during the Army of the James' and the Army of the Potomac's
         (Union) campaigns against the Army of Northern Virginia
         (Confederate), eventually culminating in the siege and capture
         of Petersburg and Richmond. In brief entries Hotchkin recounts
         marching, the weather, Confederate attacks, camp life, and his
         duties as a company clerk.</p>
      <p>After the Union victory Hotchkin, on his own or as part his
         regiment's assigned posts, visited Richmond and other Virginia
         cities during April-July 1865. He describes his regiment's
         mustering out and his trip home (July 1-15, 1865), carefully
         noting the hours and cities their steamer passed by or docked
         during the trip from Richmond to Albany, New York. Hotchkin
         visited various sights in New York City and expresses the
         soldiers' unhappiness and frustrations over delays in reaching
         home and receiving their final pay. The diaries measure 3 x
         5½ inches and total ca. 200 pages; entries are in
         pencil (and occasionally, ink), and are at times faint and
         illegible. Due to constraints in their size entries are often
         limited to brief sentences.</p>
      <p>The 1864 pocket diary (brown binding) contains 120 numbered
         pages and entries from September 15, 1864 to May 17, 1865,
         pages 2 to 112. Of interest is "Amount of Clothing Drawn"
         (page 113), a listing of blankets, canteens, drawers, pants
         and similar items purchased by Hotchkin from July 16, 1864 to
         May 2, 1865. Pages 114 to 120 include miscellaneous business
         accounts, valuation of personal items received from home, and
         lists of various persons.</p>
      <p>The flyleaf of the 1865 pocket diary (black binding) bears
         a blue five cent Confederate postal stamp of Jefferson Davis
         [Confederate States Scott No. 7] and an inscription: "W. S.
         Hotchkin/Co. 'E' 1st N. Y. Engineers/Richmond, Va./May 19th
         1865/Traded with James H. Quakenbush at Manchester, Va./May
         18th 1865." A second inscription reads: "Read by his son
         Charles F. Hotchkin at Washington, D.C. May 19, 1907, while
         delegate to the Baptist Convention. Boat to Norfolk May 20,
         1907."</p>
      <p>Page one lists regimental officers and their home
         addresses: Colonel Edward W. Serrell, Lieutenant Colonel James
         F. Hall, Major Frederick H. Cruso, [James Wainbold?--no rank]
         and [Wendall Noah?--no rank]. A roster of officers and
         enlisted men is on pages 13 to 37. The end page of this pocket
         diary contains Colonel Serrell's address: No. 57 W. Washington
         Place, New York. Pages 2 to 16, 38 to 48 and several pages
         after the July 15, 1865 entry are blank. Diary entries begin
         on page 49 and cover the period of May 6 to July 15, 1865. The
         earliest entries, May 6-17, 1865 (pages 49-51), are extremely
         illegible, but a cursory comparison of the handwriting and
         record-keeping style suggests someone made these other than
         Hotchkin, perhaps the volume's previous owner, James H.
         Quakenbush. (Hotchkin consistently begins his entries with the
         day of week, month, day and year but here these first entries
         do not.)</p>
      <p>Prominent soldiers and civilians mentioned include: P. T.
         Barnum (1810-1891); Ambrose E. Burnside (1824-1881); Benjamin
         Butler (1818-1893); George Armstrong Custer (1839-1876); James
         F. Hall (?-1884); Ulysses S. Grant (1822-1885); Robert E. Lee
         (1807-1870); Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865); George B. McClellan
         (1826-1885); George Gordon Meade (1815-1872); Edwin O. Ord
         (1818-1883); Francis H. Pierpont (1814-1899); John McAllister
         Schofield (1831-1906); Philip H. Sheridan (1831-1888); and
         William T. Sherman (1820-1891). Union regiments mentioned by
         name include the 16th Battery, New York Light Artillery
         (September 28, 1864), Batteries A &amp; M, 1st U. S. Artillery
         (January 16 &amp; April 16, 1865), the 3rd NewYork Cavalry
         (October 6, 1864), 121st New York Infantry (March 28, 1865),
         the all-black 25th Corps (April 16, 1865), and two militia (?)
         units--the 8th and 7th New York (July 3 &amp; 6, 1865).</p>
      <p>Among significant events mentioned in the diaries are: the
         cost of uniforms (September 17, 1864); the battle of Chaffin's
         Farm (September 29, 1864); soldiers' support of Lincoln's 1864

         (May 26, 1865), governor of the "restored government" of
         Virginia.</p>
