   <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
   <p>The Charlottesville Derby Dames are Charlottesville’s first and only skater-run, flat track roller derby league. The Dames’ mission is to promote sportsmanship and community by 
    providing an alternative form of fitness and entertainment to the women and men of Charlottesville and surrounding counties.</p>
   <p>The idea to form a derby team in Charlottesville began back in 2007 with founding members Jessika Daver and Phenol Barbie Doll. By October of that year the Dames had 
    recruited more team members and began to practice. The Dames made their public debut in 2008 when three CDD members (Little Miss Pissed, MatilDa Molish, Dark and Stormy) played in Commotion by the Ocean, a roller derby event in Virginia Beach. In 2009 the Dames hosted their first home bout, Daylight Slayings, featuring Charlottesville Derby Dames v. Northside Stranglers at Expoland.</p>
   <p>The league has steadily grown to around 60 members. As of January 2011, the league grew to two bouting teams drafted for skill equality at the start of the 
    season, generally referred to as "split teams" (the Downtown Maulers and the Blue Ridge Bombshells), plus a travel team comprised of reliable, devoted, and skilled 
    skaters (the All-Stars). By the end of 2012, the team added a second travel team (now known as the Belmont Bruisers) and elected to keep the split teams primarily for 
    intraleague scrimmages. In addition, the league comprises many trainers, coaches, refs, NSOs, and non-skating members. The Dames became members of the Women's Flat 
    Track Derby Association (WFTDA) in December 2012.</p>
   <p>The Dames are active in the local community and donate portions of the proceeds from their bouts and events to local charities and engage in other community events.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
   <p>The Charlottesville Derby Dames records include approximately 1,100 electronic documents, primarily in Word, Excel, PDF, and JPEG formats, outlining the formation of the team and its 
    operation. An additional 12,750 digital photographs and videos are also included, as well as captures of the Dames’ website and facebook circa December 2012.</p>
   <p>The collection covers the earliest organizational efforts of this non-profit athletic organization in 2007 and include items like meeting minutes and event planning records, rosters, 
    flyers, programs and other promotional materials, bylaws and policies. All Dames use pseudonyms when referring to each other ("derby names"), therefore supplementary documentation of 
    actual names as well as a history of events are included.</p>
   <p>In addition, the team has donated a small collection of physical flyers, programs, and any other media appearances (primarily newspaper or magazines with articles) from the years 2011 and 2012.</p>
   <p>The electronic documents contained in this collection were transferred through multiple electronic systems before arriving in the custody of the University of Virginia. 
    Transfers prior to arriving at the archive have resulted in modifying the date of creation or last modification. In particular, many documents were copied from a Yahoo! 
    message board in January of 2011 to a shared GoogleDocs drive, resulting in a date of creation of January 27, 2011. In some cases the date of the electronic document will 
    appear to be out of the scope of the collection because of a file system characteristic (such as having been created in 1979) and should not be trusted. When the approximate 
    dates of the materials are known, these are indicated in the finding aid.</p>

        <p>The Dames have multiple sub-committees as well as monthly overall team meetings. This series contains meeting minutes and other documentation 
          produced by these committees. The original committees in 2008 were Membership, Public Relations (PR), Coaching, Fundraising, Community Service, and 
          Bout Production/Space. The committees were simplified into three major committees in 2010: Community Relations (including the former PR, 
          Fundraising and Community Services committees), Team Building (including the former Coaching and Membership Committees) and Productions. In addition, 
          the Dames vote in a Management Team every year consisting of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Two Skater Representatives, and the Heads of the three committees.</p>

            posted to the group's online message board which is not included in this collection. A large sub-committee of Team Building is Coaching and minutes exist for this 
            group going back to 2008 before it became a sub-committee of Team Building.</p>
