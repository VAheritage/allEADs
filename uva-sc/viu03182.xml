         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The papers of Reverend William H. Laird (1901- ?), pastor
         of St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Charlottesville, Virginia,
         prior to World War II, consist of ca. 1,400 items (6 Hollinger
         boxes; 2 linear feet), 1940- 1947, chiefly the correspondence
         of Laird and his family while serving as Chaplain of the 8th
         Evacuation Hospital Unit which was composed of University of
         Virginia medical personnel.</p>
         <p>Other material in the collection include: diaries recording
         the ministerial activities of Chaplain Laird, Italian road
         maps, two notebooks explaining references to people in the
         Laird family correspondence, photographs, postcards, and
         printed material. The whole collection is a fairly complete
         unit of material pertaining to the wartime activities of not
         only Laird but the whole 8th Evacuation Hospital Unit from the
         time of its formation in January to June, 1942, through its
         service in Casablanca, Morocco, and various locations in
         Italy. Laird's papers provide a good inside view of the 8th
         Evacuation Hospital Unit but Army censorship regulations
         forced him to leave out information of a military nature. For
         a complete history of the unit, consult 
         <title render="italic">The 8th Evac. A History of the
         University of Virginia Hospital Unit in World War II</title>by
         Byrd Stuart Leavell. Letters from home furnish insight into
         the effects of the second World War upon family members left
         behind.</p>
         <p>The bulk of the collection consists of correspondence
         between Laird and his wife Constance Kennon (1906- ?), married
         on October 10, 1929, and their children, Helen (1931- ), Molly
         (1934- ), and Billy (1938- ), with an occasional letter from
         other family and friends. Topics mentioned in the letters will
         be listed in chronological order under each individual year.
         Individuals discussed in the correspondence are identified in
         two notebooks within the collection according to the date of
         the letter in which they are mentioned. Most of Mrs. Laird's
         early letters to her husband were lost en route to Italy.</p>
