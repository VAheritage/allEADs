        <head>Acquisition Information</head>
        <p>The scrapbooks were loaned for microfilming and
            historical reference by Mrs. Viola Barrett Greenland Pope
            on May 4, 1991 and were formally accessioned on June 3,
            1991.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The three scrapbooks in this collection contain
         newsclippings, photographs, articles, correspondence,
         announcements and manuscripts, ca. 1898-1945, of the Barrett
         Family, primarily Tullius Tupper, Vernon Southall Tupper,
         Robert South Barrett, Viola Tupper Barrett, Kate Waller
         Barrett, John Paul Barker Barrett, and Clifton Waller Barrett
         as well as material collected by various members of the
         family. The scrapbooks document the history of the family, and
         their civic, philanthropic, and literary accomplishments and
         interests. Since the contents of the scrapbooks are not in
         chronological order (they contain considerable overlapping,
         and even duplication, of material from the same general time
         periods), the user is encouraged to review the collection 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">en toto</title>for items pertinent to
         his or her research.</p>
      <p>Due to limitations of time and the condition of the
         scrapbooks, particularly the manner in which many of the items
         were mounted (often left folded within a mounted envelope),
         the scrapbooks could not filmed in their entirety. Loose
         papers were removed from the volumes, placed in folders
         identifying the volumes from which they came, and filmed as a
         series preceding the volumes themselves.</p>
      <p>In general, the following materials were filmed in their
         entirety: original correspondence, photographs, manuscripts,
         and news articles by (or pertaining to) members of the Barrett
         family, including multi- page items. Original materials
         enclosed in mounted envelopes were either opened in a
         "display" format and filmed 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">in situ</title>, or were photocopied
         and the copies were then either displayed 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">in situ</title>or placed in the "loose
         papers" series.</p>
      <p>The following materials were omitted (or in the case of
         multi-page items, only the first page was filmed): Routine
         notes and greeting cards enclosed in mounted envelopes,
         duplicate or redundant news articles, and news articles and
         pamphlets collected by, but not specifically mentioning,
         members of the family. In the latter category are numerous
         news clippings (both prose and poetry) illustrative of the
         historical, literary, religious, and civic interests of the
         family. Many of these were filmed (at least in part) to
         provide the researcher a greater understanding of the varied
         interests of the family.</p>
