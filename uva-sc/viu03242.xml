      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Thomas Lafayette Rosser was born on a farm near Charlottesville, Virginia,
         on October 15, 1836, the oldest son of seven children. He
         attended West Point where his classmates included John Pelham
         and George Armstrong Custer, who was later to become his
         bitter rival in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War.
         Rosser resigned from West Point in 1861 and joined the
         Confederate Army. He was named first lieutenant of the
         Washington Artillery and fought at the First Battle of Bull
         Run in July 1861. He rose quickly in the ranks, serving as a
         captain in the Peninsular campaigns of 1862, in which he was
         wounded, and following his recovery was promoted to colonel of
         the Fifth Virginia Calvalry. He commanded his regiment at the
         Second Battle of Bull Run, South Mountain, and Gettysburg
         before his appointment as brigadier general.</p>
      <p>Following the war, Rosser was appointed chief engineer for
         the Northern Pacific Railroad. In 1871 he led a survey
         expedition along the Missouri River as far as the Yellowstone
         River, searching for a suitable route for the new railroad.
         Rosser died in 1910, one of the last surviving confederate
         generals.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists chiefly of the papers of Brigadier
         General Thomas Lafayette Rosser, C.S.A. and members of his
         family of Albemarle County, Virginia. Correspondence comprises
         the bulk of the collection and is largely that of General
         Rosser.</p>
      <p>Rosser's correspondence in this collection dates from
         1860-1906 and includes letters from Robert E. Lee, J.E.B.
         Stuart, Jubal Early, Judah P. Benjamin, Jefferson Davis, James
         Dearing, Wade Hampton, George Wythe Randolph, and other Civil
         War figures; other correspondents include Sam Houston, John W.
         Daniel, Fitzhugh Lee, and John S. Wise.</p>
      <p>General Stuart was particularly pleased with Rosser's
         military ability and recommended him for several promotions,
         including his appointment as brigadier general on September
         28, 1863.</p>
      <p>Of particular interest in the collection is a small
         personal journal which Rosser kept during the early days of
         the Yellowstone Expedition. In it he describes the scenery and
         the resources of the new land and reports on the morale of the
         survey party.</p>
      <p>Also included in the collection is correspondence of Betty
         Winston Rosser, whom Rosser met and married during the Civil
         War, of Thomas L. Rosser, Jr., their son, and Miss Barbara
         Rosser, their granddaughter. There are also papers concerning
         their home, Rugby Hall, on Rugby Road that Mrs. Rosser
         operated as a boarding house, as well as samples of her poetry
         an an essay describing the construction of her home on the
         [Assmabin] River. Thomas L. Rosser, Jr. was a student at the
         University of Virginia from 1886 to 1890, and several of his
         class notebooks on law and psychology are included in the
         collection.</p>
      <p>The Rosser collection contains biographical material
         regarding General Rosser and genealogical charts and other
         information concerning the Winston and Robinson families. Also
         included are legal papers, business accounts, bills, receipts,
         and a series of lantern slides, primarily concerning the Civil
         War.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement>
      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The Rosser collection is divided into series of
         correspondence, manuscripts, notebooks, scrapbooks, newspaper
         clippings, printed material, and latern slides. The
         correspondence of Thomas L. Rosser (a detailed list of
         correspondents and dates is included in this guide) is
         followed by that of his wife, son, and granddaughter. A file
         of miscellaneous letters completes the correspondence. The
         correspondence is followed by manuscript items such as
         Rosser's journal, biographical and genealogical material,
         legal papers, and business accounts. The school notebooks of
         Thomas L. Rosser, Jr. are filed next in chronological order
         and are followed by scrapbooks, newsclippings, and printed
         material. The lantern slides complete the collection and are
         divided into four categories: Civil War slides, Religious
         Scenes, Playlets, and Miscellaneous.</p>
