      <p>This item, ca. 1858, is an ambrotype of Thomas Lafayette
         Rosser (1836-1910) as a West Point cadet. He was born in
         Campbell County, Virginia, but his family had moved to Panola
         County, Texas, when he was thirteen. Rosser was nominated to
         the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, by
         Congressman Lemuel Dale Evans (1810-1877) who was afterward
         chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>Rosser enrolled at the Academy on July 1, 1856, and his
         photograph depicts him during his sophomore year when his
         standing was 42 out of a class of 52. He was physically
         described as having black hair and dark brown eyes with a
         height of six feet two inches. West Point had a five year
         curriculum for its cadets during Rosser's enrollment, but he
         resigned on April 22, 1861, two weeks before the graduation of
         the class of 1861. He joined the Confederacy, and during the
         Civil War was eventually promoted to the rank of major
         general. Afterwards he settled in Charlottesville during the
         1880's, became its postmaster, and later served as a brigadier
         general during the Spanish-American War.</p>
