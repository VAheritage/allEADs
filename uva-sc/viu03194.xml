        <p>This volume was purchased from James L. Hook of
            Bala-Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, on July 8, 1941 for the Tracy W.
            McGregor Library.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This bound volume served two purposes, first as a hospital
         invoice book maintained by Samuel H. Moffett, a Confederate
         surgeon at Hanover Junction, Virginia, 1862-1864, and as a
         record of court fees paid ("Settlement Docket IV") in Guilford
         County, North Carolina from 1866 to 1868.</p>
      <p>Surgeon Moffett utilized the first part of the volume to
         record invoices of supplies and property, clothing, money and
         personal effects of deceased patients, and for quarterly
         returns of hospitals for which he was responsible from June
         20, 1862 to October 19, 1864. The patients were members of
         North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Alabama, and Florida
         Confederate regiments; a separate list of their names, ranks,
         and unit designations has been appended to this guide.</p>
      <p>The bulk of Moffett's entries pertain to the Hanover
         Junction Hospital and the Gordonsville Quarantine Hospital but
         there are occasional accounts for hospitals at Orange Court
         House, Louisa Court House, Winchester, Charlottesville,
         Petersburg, and Richmond. Surgeons W. A. Carswell (Hanover),
         Z. B. Herndon (Gordonsville, Richmond), Joseph E. Claggett
         (Winchester), James L. Cabell (Charlottesville) and J. W.
         Sears(?) are cited. Quartermasters and assistant
         quartermasters of whom Moffett submitted or received reports
         and supplies were Captains T. Hunter and G. G. Osgoin(?), and
         Majors W. B. Richards, Jr. and William G. Ber[?] ; among the
         medical purveyors were Z. B. Herndon, A. G. Fry, W. John, W.
         H. Geddings, and J. W. Hines.</p>
      <p>According to the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Southern Historical Society
         Papers</title>, Volume XV, 1887, Moffett and Claggett were
         paroled with the Amy of Northern Virginia at Appomattox on
         April 9, 1865 (page 2). For further information on these and
         other Confederate surgeons and hospitals in Virginia consult
         Wyndham B. Blanton's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Medicine In Virginia In the Nineteenth
         Century</title>, 1933; a copy of this study is available in
         Alderman Library.</p>
      <p>The Guilford County Court docket book entries (pages 1 to
         66) comprise most the latter part of the volume. These were
         maintained by county court clerks and provide a register of
         transactions for court terms of November, 1866 and from
         February, 1867 to May, 1868. The names of litigants and their
         payment of miscellaneous fees for marriage licenses, tax
         stamps, administration of estates, and other legal documents
         are represented; "Office" [clerks's office], "State," and
         "County Court" infrequently appear as litigants. Several
         1867-1868 bastardy suits are indicated beginning on page 17 as
         well as the amount of payments received and distributed to
         mothers on behalf of their children.</p>
      <p>Abram Clapp and Lyndon Swain are listed as county clerks,
         and R. M. Stafford as sheriff. The signatures of numerous
         Guilford County residents [some of whom have been identified
         in the published index to the 1850 North Carolina census] are
         also present. Of passing interest is an August 8, 1867 entry
         for a black man named William(?) Jones [listed as a 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">freedman</title>] who apparently filed
         suit against the Natural Express &amp; Transportation Company.
         Business organizations such as Gilmer and Gilmer (a law firm?)
         and the Guilford Copper &amp; Mining Company are frequently
         mentioned; others include Kirtland &amp; Bronson, Berrett
         &amp; Higgins, the Gardner Hill Mining Company, North Carolina
         Petroleum and Mining Company, and the Piedmont Railroad.</p>
