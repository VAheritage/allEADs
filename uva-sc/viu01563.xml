      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>There are nineteen letters, 1871-1875, written to Thomas
         Hughes (1850- ) by his father, Alfred Hughes, and various
         legal associates. Thomas attended the University of Virginia
         from 1871-1872 and graduated with his Bachelor of Law; he
         returned to Baltimore to practice law. During August and
         September 1871, Alfred Hughes writes to his son in Wheeling,
         [West] Virginia, on the occasion of his twenty-first birthday
         (August 24); mentioning widespread damage caused by hard rains
         (August 31); requesting his return home to help while he is in
         ill health (September 6); and, making alternate travel
         arrangements for him as the rivers near Wheeling are too low
         for the boats to run (September 13). In the latter letter, he
         also refers to attending to some business in order to get him
         off to college. On February 18, 1872, there is a letter to
         Thomas at the University of Virginia informing him of the
         death of his Grandmother Hughes and relaying his parents'
         plans. On June 21, 1872, Alfred Hughes writes to his son at
         the University, expressing pride in his accomplishments and
         giving advice and encouragement. He writes that there are
         three principles of life and happiness--"a 
         <emph render="underline">pure heart</emph>, a 
         <emph render="underline">clean conscience</emph>, &amp; 
         <emph render="underline">good health</emph>." There are three
         letters from H. G[raham] Gordon (1850- ) of Fredericksburg,
         Virginia. His letter of November 26, 1872 pertains to his
         plans to settle in Baltimore and open a law firm with Thomas,
         and refers to his brother-in-law, Charles Herndon, a Virginia
         politician. On March 19, 1873, Gordon writes from
         Fredericksburg, sending a list of certain lawyers of the lower
         counties and making arrangements for the firm for his
         departure. There is also a letter dated July 11, 1873. There
         are letters concerning various legal suits from Henry M[oore]
         Russell (1851- 1915) of Wheeling, West Virginia (April 9,
         1873; October 7, 1874; November 30, 1874); F. Ravenscroft
         (December 20, 1873); and, James A. C. Bond of Baltimore,
         Maryland (June 17, 1874; July 2, 1874). The latter two letters
         from Russell pertain to the estate of Thomas Hughes, Alfred
         Hughes' father.</p>
