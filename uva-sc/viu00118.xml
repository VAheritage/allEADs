      <p>During 1942-1947, 
         <persname>Andrew Trigg Sanders</persname>(1910-) wrote about
         life in 
         <geogname>North Africa</geogname>during World War II, general
         news about the war and conditions, and family and other news
         from home. On February 27, 1942, he wrote about camp life
         [probably in North Africa]. During October through December
         1942, he was at 
         <geogname>Camp Pickett, Virginia</geogname>, the location of
         new headquarters. During 1943, he wrote from North Africa.
         There are letters revealing his work in the supply section and
         with the Special Services branch, planning athletic and
         entertainment programs, and commenting on Arab lifestyles
         (March 16); mentioning news of a friend "Jean," who had her
         picture taken with 
         <persname>Walt Disney</persname>and that two Virginia medical
         units are nearby (April 24); discussing organizational changes
         and inquiring about rationing at home (May 17); referring to
         his teaching school, a class for 2nd lieutenants and enlisted
         men (July 9); remarking that recent developments make it
         harder to identify friend or enemy (October 3); and, relating
         news of the death of young Graham, son of Dave and Verna and
         the sale of the Graham farm (October 3, November 10). From
         November 1943 until October 30, 1945, he was in 
         <geogname>Italy</geogname>. On November 27, 1943, he wrote,
         after arriving, that the people and the country were quite
         different than in 
         <geogname>North Africa</geogname>, that fruits and nuts were
         plentiful but that there was a shortage of other foods, that
         the land was more fertile but that the destruction greater,
         and that the people were easier to talk to than the French. On
         May 29, 1944, he reported that he was doing special work away
         from his unit and having a chance to see more of the country.
         By June 23, 1944, he returned to his unit and found many
         changes, which he also mentioned in his letter of August 18,
         1944. In his letter of September 19, 1944, he speculated as to
         when the war would be over and whether they would go to the 
         <geogname>Pacific</geogname>; mentioned casting his vote for
         Roosevelt; and being sent to 
         <geogname>Rome</geogname>in charge of a group of men going
         there to rest, where he got the chance to tour certain points
         of interest. There are several letters following that discuss
         general news about the war and his family at home. On May 9,
         1945, he was anxious to hear about the point system and
         expected to remain in 
         <geogname>Naples</geogname>for six or eight months. And, on
         May 25, he wrote that service troops would be the last to
         return home. On July 12, 1945, he wrote that they are now
         preparing equipment for the East, that there were 3,000
         soldiers, civilians, and POWs in one shop, and that he was now
         executive officer. Through the end of 1945, his letters are
         filled with hopes of returning home. There is also a letter,
         January 31, 1947, concerning a training session re: crude
         petroleum.</p>
      <p>Letters, 1926-1947, from 
         <persname>Edwin Hanson Sanders</persname>(1871-1948), and
         related correspondence, discuss family and business matters.
         There is a letter, April 5, 1929, from 
         <persname>Shipton Kincannon Curran Sanders</persname>(his
         mother) to 
         <persname>William E. Fulton</persname>concerning family news.
         A letter of August 18, 1933, from Rev. 
         <persname>H. G. Allen</persname>discusses the death of 
         <persname>Shipton K. C. Sanders</persname>. 
         <persname>Edwin Hanson Sanders</persname>wrote from the 
         <corpname>Department of Agriculture</corpname>and Immigration,
         discussing breed of cattle and mentioning the effect of the
         war or prospects for war on farm products (November 10, 1939);
         and, giving a comparison of the business boom during the
         Spanish-American War, World War I, and the current one,
         mentioning the growing business activity at Radford with some
         eight thousand working, and commenting on low patriotism,
         partly due to salary conflicts.</p>
      <p>Letters, 1924-1925, from 
         <persname>Edwin Hanson Sanders, Jr.</persname>discuss life at 
         <corpname>Hampden-Sidney</corpname>. Letters of March 1 and 22
         refer to his bid to an honorary fraternity [ 
         <corpname>The 13 Society</corpname>], which chose "all round
         good men," who were then only known as members during their
         senior year.</p>
      <p>Letters, 1939-1946, from 
         <persname>Friel Tate Sanders</persname>(1915-1959) cover
         chiefly the period during World War II. During February 1943
         through April 1945, he was stationed in China. On March 20, he
         wrote that he arrived at his assigned post and was living in a
         private home and described life there. His letter of July 20,
         1943 mentioned that the foods were similar, such as new
         potatoes, beans, tomatoes, corn, chicken, and watermelon. On
         July 31, 1944, he has heard good news and broadcasts about the
         Germans and Japanese. On November 28, 1944, he wrote that he
         has been moved to a new station; and, on March 20, 1945, he
         wrote that he is awaiting orders to go home. He wrote, from 
         <geogname>Miami Beach, Florida</geogname>, on May 18, 1945,
         that the war was over, that he has finished processing and is
         awaiting a new assignment, that some materials are being
         released, such as tires, and that there is a possibility of an
         increase in gas allowance. During June through August 1945, he
         wrote from 
         <geogname>Stuttgart, Arkansas</geogname>, concerning work and
         continuing studies under the G.I. Bill. Letters of October 31
         and December 19, 1946, are concerned with his marriage to 
         <persname>Nelda Rose Hunter</persname>.</p>
