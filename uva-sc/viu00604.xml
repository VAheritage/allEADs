         <head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
         <p>Ernest Hemingway (July 21, 1899-July 2, 1961)was an American novelist, short-story writer and journalist. His distinctive writing style is characterized by economy and understatement and had a significant influence on the development of twentieth century fiction. Hemingway's stoic protagonists are often seen as projections of his own character- men who must show grace under pressure. Many of his works are considered classics in the canon of American literature.
</p>
         <p>Hemingway, nicknamed "Papa," was part of the 1920s expatriate community in Paris, as described in his memoir <title render="italic">A Moveable Feast</title>, and was known as part of "the Lost Generation," a name he popularized. He led a turbulent social life, was married four times, and allegedly had various romantic relationships during his lifetime. Hemingway received the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 for <title render="italic">The Old Man and the Sea</title>. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. In 1961, at age 61, he committed suicide in Idaho.

                  <p> Holograph pages in ink and pencil, representing the text before transcription to typescript. There is no page 78 in the manuscript. This was a numbering mistake on Hemingway's part. The typing job was done by Jane Armstrong (wife of the journalist-photographer Richard Armstrong) in Cuba, as Hemingway explains in his letter fragment to [Charles Scribner] that accompanies the manuscript, attesting to its authenticity. He says he wanted to give Jane Armstrong something that would be worth money someday as thanks for help; hence, her possession of the manuscript. He urges Scribner's to pay Mrs. Armstrong's daughter (who is offering the manuscript for sale) "all you can for it to take your percentage" on resale. SEE SLIPCASE <num>6250-a</num>

                  <p> There are many differences between this typescript and what finally appeared in the published version. And the changes are throughout. Generally Hemingway was much less temperate in his language. As an example, he is more scathing and more detailed in his attacks on Gertrude Stein.</p>
 <p>Jane Armstrong used two different typewriters during her typing of the book. One of the typefaces is pica, ten characters to the inch, and the other is a unique, larger type, about nine characters to the inch. SEE SLIPCASE <num>6250-s</num>

                  <p> After <title render="italic">The Sun Also Rises</title> was set in galley proofs at Scribner's, F. Scott Fitzgerald read a carbon copy and suggested that the first two chapters be omitted and that the novel begin with the opening of chapter three, when Jake Barnes meets the prostitute Georgette. Hemingway took Fitzgerald's advice partially and deleted most of the first two chapters, about 3,500 words beginning with the introduction of Robert Cohn. After the deletion, Hemingway tried several times to insert a beginning that explained the disappearance of the opening material. He eventually abandoned this effort because "by referring to the cut chapters it merely capsulizes the faults of those chapters." After the very late revision suggested by Fitzgerald, the novel was published October 1926 as it stands today. This is the printer's setting copy of <title render="italic">The Sun Also Rises</title> which, in the original state, contained the two opening chapters excised after the book was already in galleys. This typescript, which had been in the Louis H. Cohn Collection, was presented to the University of Virginia Library in March 1977 by Mrs. Louis H. Cohn as a memorial to her late husband.

                  <p> Enclosed signed contract, and new story to replace the one he is eliminating as censorable. Stipulates no alterations of words are to be made without his approval. Good news that it is no longer necessary to eliminate "the fine old word 'son of a bitch.'" Thinks book has a good gambling chance to sell. Classic examples of really fine book that could not sell: E. E. Cummings' The Enormous Room. Hemingway's book will be praised by highbrows and can be read by lowbrows. Has a good 3/1 chance. The new story makes a better book: it's almost the best he's ever written. He is eliminating the second story, <title render="doublequote">Up in Michigan,</title> the next three move up one place and the new story, <title render="doublequote">The Battler,</title> takes place of <title render="doublequote">The Three Day Blow.</title> Pleased to be published by Boni &amp; Liveright.

                  <p> Mrs. Moorhead gave them a couple of bottles of damned fine wine. Walsh seems suspicious that Hemingway is inventing ways to do him out of money.

                  <p> Won't be a Spanish letter as working all the time on novel [<title render="italic">The Sun Also Rises</title>]. 68,000 words done. Going to be a swell novel with no autobiography and no complaints. <title render="italic">In Our Time</title> comes out the last of September with Boni &amp; Liveright. May see him in Milan as he and Hadley going on walking tour through Tyrol and the Dolomites, and they may hop a train to see if Campari's can still put out a meal. Ready for a loaf when he gets book done. "Christ, how I've worked." Will put it away and not look at it until after Christmas, when he'll go over it, cut and fix it up and type it himself. Sending two photographs. Italians are worse crooks than the French, but the Milanese are the best of the Italians. Can't live in Italy because the political situation makes him so furious that he is upset and in trouble all the time. Discusses the murders of Matteoli. Promised himself he would not go to Italy again as long as the Fascists are in power. Discouraging to think that the country that produced Garibaldi should be ruled by that gang. As soon as Italy became a united nation it was finished. Poor old Cavour.  <num>6250-a</num>

                  <p> Sending on the <title render="italic">Mauretania</title> manuscript of his new book, <title render="italic">The Torrents of Spring.</title>  F. Scott Fitzgerald read and is very excited about it. This is not the long novel which he is calling <title render="italic">The Sun Also Rises</title>, which he is rewriting and working on all winter. Compares [<title render="italic">The Torrents of Spring</title>] to Fielding and Richardson. Bromfield read and said it was one of the funniest books he has ever read, and a very perfect American satire. Wishes he would get Ralph Barton to illustrate it. If he takes it, he has to push it. Has made no kick regarding lack of publicity for <title render="italic">In Our Time.</title>  It should come out in the spring. Only reason he wouldn't publish it is for fear of offending Sherwood [Anderson]. If he takes book, wants $500 advance. Should ask for $1,000 as he can sell 20,000 copies. Funny books not to easy to get hold of. Those who have read <title render="doublequote">Black Laughter</title> will purchase. Cable him in Austria his decision on <title render="italic">The Torrents of Spring.</title>

Hopes he will let him have one of the books of poems. Has seen no literary gents, but sees by clippings they are constant attendees at literary teas, i.e. Bercovici, Bromfield, Wharton, Seldes, etc. to write the local color stories. Will be in Spain middle of May on. He has got mixed up in making some bullfight films for South American and European consumption. Will get his bullfights free. Got tight when leaving New York.

                  <p> Hemingway responds angrily to Romaine's suggestion to stop writing about "Lost Generations and bulls;" he could be jailed for the publication of his political beliefs; Dos Passos and Wilder are not good writers and he has not read Faulkner's "early crap."  <num>6250-ab</num>

                  <p> Thanks Jane for swell typing job. It was a beautiful job figuring out what the hell Hemingway's holograph meant and he appreciates it. Max Perkins and Dos [John Dos Passos] have read it and like it very much. Hemingway is feeling better about it. Believes Jane likes it because she likes Africa and Dick likes it because he likes to drink. Asks them a favor: would they contact a few people in Cuba to help out with an article he is writing on Cuban marlin fishing? <num>6250-s</num>

                  <p> Doesn't know why Strauss's girl thought Hemingway liked war: "Christ knows I didn't like it for other people." Doesn't understand how people lie about him. "I would rather kill racehorses that I am fond of than lie in a story." Better not to talk and better, in some ways, not to have friends. Can tell what his enemies may do but not his friends. Plans to write stories Strauss will like. Discusses <title render="italic">La Condition Humane</title> by Andre Malraux. "Goddamn it takes a while to make a writer." <num>6250-j</num>

                  <p> Not sore at him but wishes he would come down and fish and discuss set-up. Treated Joe Losey squarely. Hoped Losey could raise money and put on show. Option ran out and Hemingway sold Glazer the right to make adaptation subject to certain conditions. They hoped he would permit his name to be used. Only friendly feeling for Mac and Joe. Never prejudiced their interests. He is under no obligation to ask anyone's advice on how he should dispose of his property, and it was neither disloyal nor unfriendly for him not to come to Mac. <num>6250-a</num>

                  <p>Things quiet in Italy as seven years between elections. Italians are a wonderful people. Probably had worst press in the world. Meeting people he fought against and seeing places with more understanding. Wonderful for him. Owes two stories due by end of December or he returns the dough. Wrote one, but too rough for <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan.</title>  They've published the best stories he has written. Back to Cuba in May. <title render="italic">Life</title> piece made him sick. Difference between <title render="italic">Life</title> and life. He tries to be a good character, keeps promises, etc. but doesn't think [Malcolm] Cowley knows anything about what people like him are made of. Reading it, he felt as if he were being formed in Cowley's image. Had a nice, private life before, but now feels like somebody had shit in it and left it there. Glad Truman won, but it has gone to what he thinks of as his head. Mary broke her leg skiing. Raves about Bob Flaherty. Small torn fragment from bottom left of letter in envelope. <num>6250-f</num>

Doesn't want to take advance on the novel because he doesn't want anyone looking over his shoulder. All is well. Mary recovered from broken leg. His infection on his face is now better.

Hemingway is getting sick of the mystique of bravery etc. being piled on and manufactured situations and crap in general. Glad DiMaggio is playing again. Remembers playing baseball as a youth. Loved it more than any other game. Discusses his relationship with the church: "after being married twice out of the church you would think the Jesuits might have given me up as hopeless." Life is very complicated. Anecdote about chaplain in the 4th Infantry Division. His fighting chickens have won 38 out of 42 fights and keep them in the food. Shooting pigeons. Discusses activities of his sons. Read only one Flaherty profile, which made him seem like a little boy reading it.

They thought a Felluca had something to do with Felattio (Also mis-spelled) and that I was either over-extending myself or setting up a personal harem." Discusses John O'Hara's books and criticizes him: "He has a pretty ear but he had the terrible inferiority complex of the half-lace curtain Irish and he never learned that it doesn't matter a fuck where you come from, socially, it is where you go." Wrote him off but happy that he was wrong. Mentions his son, Gigi, who threw a pitch at Hemingway's head during baseball game. Discusses Gigi a lot, and states that he is the only boy that "turned out Indian, not Cherokee, Digger, Pyute, Navajo, or any of those unfortunate peoples but Northern Cheyenne and he has all the problems of them, as I always had, and all the lack of problems that having that blood gives you."

Gone completely legal and doesn't like the government, and doesn't want to take any favors from them. Wonderful news regarding fight films on the way down. Mary is with her parents and he is lonely. Discusses his activities and amount he is writing. Out to shoot pigeons. Writing is his true love. Drinking is fun, not a release from something. But he is not a first stone caster. Thinks book will run in three installments, and that it is the best one he has written, although he is prejudiced. No doghouse trouble anymore: "A man should know how to get out of that doghouse or else should turn in his suit." But he loves "Miss Mary, truly." Thanks for $10,000 check, but hasn't cashed it yet. Eleven different hurricanes kicking around. "Must get going now or Miss Mary will tell me that I am not taking life seriously. Some day I might take it seriously and a lot of characters would hang by their necks until dead."Signed by Hemingway's secretary, Miss Nita. <num>6250-f</num>

                  <p>Talks about finishing book [<title render="italic">Across the River and Into the Trees</title>?]. Will be glad when it's done, but will miss it for a while. Just wrote a "god-damn wonder chapter." Got it all, to break your heart, into two pages. Discusses geographical locations he loves in Western States, such as Red Lodge, Montana or Cody, Wyoming or West Yellowstone or Billings "on a Saturday night" or Casper "where Mary lost our kid." Borrowed 10 G for operation mink coat, for Mary. Went to a circus and saw the lions. Will work the cats in public after the book is done. Would rather work them than do most anything else, if you don't have to use whip, chair, or make theater. Will be introduced as, "An Illustrious domador del norte, now retired from the profession, but who, through his aficion, dedicates this rather special number to the Cuban public."

                  <p>Thanks for the fight films. Is at 47,474 words today, which interests the shit out of him. Tells Hotchner that there must be an element of surprise with the book, or there is no deal. Got into trouble with Miss Mary when the photographer showed photographs to them, which included the "whore that we now call Xenophobia." Got into doghouse because of that. Cannot make a lie stick with Miss Mary; it is the quickest way to starve yourself to death that is still available. Will be lonesome when the book is done. He never had a better friend or a more severest critic. Have been slugging it out with Mr. Shakespeare, the writer. I guess maybe he is old. Mentions Mr. Tito who did very well, not for himself, but for everybody. Charlie Scribner is as dumb as a horse. Signed by Hemingway's secretary, Miss Nita. <num>6250-f</num>

All stories are made up, but you have to invent from knowledge. American criticism is sort of funny. Anything they have not been taught, they think is not true. If you fight they hate you because they don't fight. Gives anecdote of Col. Jim Luckett. "You write that and they tell you that such things never happened.

                  <p>Bad timing [about Hotchner being fired]. Does he have any money for coming events and could Hemingway help him? Would not have given the novel to <title render="italic">Scribner's</title> except for Hotchner; had promised it to <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> and wouldn't let anyone else bid on it. Talks about duck and geese hunting. Dealing with his face infection he had picked up a week ago.

Tell Ted Patrick that Hotchner controls where Hemingway's stuff goes and that he "would not sell nothing to noplace where [Hotchner] was not working at unless [he] accepted service under the Woman's Home Upfuck or the Ladie's Home Compassion." Mistake to serialize as they did, but they made the mistake and "does a man cry over spilt shit or a spilt horse or whores?" No. Has done the rewrite on the whole book, but wishes Hotchner has been around to help with his "good, clean, smart, just head" and heart as bad as his. <num>6250-x</num>

Going around with heart sort of a displaced person is not much fun but "it is damn sight easier than being in Korea." Has been working with lions: "Takes your mind off things." Has been offered a job working with the cats but decided to stick with book writing. He may do a story on the circus. "The Korean thing takes all the fun out of kidding." His book [<title render="italic">Across the River and Into the Trees</title>] best seller for ten weeks. Talks about MacArthur and Sir Charles Willouby, "phony, a passed-over-liar that nobody would take and really a failed Kraut." In regards to the Korean War, "this is the first time my country even fought and I was not there and food has no taste and the hell with love when you can't have children etc." <title render="italic">The Post</title> are good people; <title render="italic">Collier's</title> have been "bitches, untruthful, and never complying with their obligations." <title render="italic">Esquire</title> "like living in a cave with cheap thieves without a sense of humour [sic]."

                  <p>Whether he will be in the States in December, 1951 comes close to being the $64 question. Should not defend his work except with more and better work. Appreciates him defending it if he thinks it good, but he himself should not do so. There wsa great discrepancies between reviews and letters he received regarding last book [<title render="italic">Across the River and Into the Trees</title>]. Berenson liked it very much. Many soldiers wrote that they read it four or five times. So far only two wrote against it. Shamus McManus was one. Has to get to work as his head is someplace else. Cannot come to meeting. William B. Seward, in English Department at William and Mary, knows what Hemingway is trying to do. Hemingway couldn't read McCaffery collection. It was "too much writing about something you knew too much about." He "honest to Christ" has to get to work. Believed his last book a fine one and read it over 100 times, but he couldn't say that to people nor make them believe he didn't think it was good because he wrote it.

Wants to finish book so he can shoot in the International Championships. Scandal in Paris and Venice that Adriana is the girl in "that book we all wrote. You know this is impossible."

                  <p> Sorry about Mark, who died. Hemingway knew him during the war and he took the "same way out" as Scott, which "seems to be an Irish ending." Wishes he knew Mark better because he was "an awful good guy." Wishes he was racing again with Hotchner. Talks about a bar-fight Hemingway was in: "I nailed him with two left hooks and a right chop." <num>6250-f</num>

                  <p>Hemingway writes from Nairobi mentioning possibly seeking employment as temporary game ranger, surveying elephants and fish, and flying with Roy Marsch; and apologizes for not writing Jigee Viertel. Writes in detail about looking "after a leopard who killed 10 goats in one night..."; boxing with native "boys"; and learning to hunt with a spear, giving a list of animals killed to date. Also refers to a [movie collaboration?] with Faulkner and Hughes, noting "all the stories I know now are barrred from the screen on acct. of miscegenation. Also all to rough."

Discusses [<title render="italic">The Green Hills of Africa</title>] royalties. Enjoy his time while in the United States and give his best to Polish writers when he gets home. <num>6250-g</num>

                  <p>Sorry not to have written Zielinski since Malaga. Hemingway has had trouble and has been working very hard. Mary fractured her arm very badly which required drastic surgery. Took much of Hemingway's time. Valerie has helped out a lot but Hemingway is over-worked trying to make up for lost time. They all toasted Zielinski at Christmas and New Year's.

                  <p>Thanks for his fine letters, the pictures, and the clippings. Hemingway has been working very hard. Wanted to write him but kept on writing and hunting. Good shooting after he left. After duck season they hunted jack-rabbits for the farmers and trapped magpies. Details their stops on the way to Key West. Relates how in Texas "every filling station for three hundred miles had been robbed in one night." Talks about his loss of weight, exercise routine, the revolution in Cuba.

                  <p>Thanks for letters. Hemingway could not find African pictures for him. Nor could he answer his very intelligent questions. Should have two secretaries. Seen 14 bull fights since they got to Spain. Antonio [Ordez] was badly gored on May 30th. Enjoyed magazine and will try to be a good Polish writer. Discusses the things wrongly accredited to him in June 20th edition of <title render="italic">Paris Match</title>: "Some of it was interesting. But it was all shit and I did not say it." Discusses how, for some strange reason, "probably because Mary is so lovely," that they are very well liked." Hemingway loves Spain the way he loves Idaho.

His training has been really fractured. Two more fights and he goes to Peru. How do the business deals go? Relates of his trip through Spain. Got pick-pocketed signing autographs.

                  <p>Good flight. Mary friendly but holds to same program. Will go to Ketchum to help with Antonio [Ordez] and Carmen on certain conditions: no cooking, and he is not to shoot with Mrs. Gray unless Mary is present. Mary will go to New York to write. Hemingway moves as cheerfully as possible like in a Kafka nightmare. He is bone-tired and very beat up emotionally. Wants to get back to writing. One of the big issues is that he expects others to subordinate themselves to his writing, and thus make them lead lives of drudges. Will tell about the real revolution in Cuba. Hopes United States won't cut sugar quota. He will be amazed at change. <num>6250-f</num>

They are publishing Mary's story. Much about rivalry between [Luis Miguel] Domingu&#205;n and [Antonio] Ordez. Hemingway refuses to interrupt present research to do special piece. Much about dickering regarding price, size, etc. Hemingway says hard economics, not vanity, dictates figures. Write regarding Antonio and photographs with Bill Lang. Sent advance payment of $10,000 for bull-fighting article. Discusses Mary's shattered elbow. <title render="italic">Life</title> hopes to print article in single issue. Hemingway defends why piece is so long (63,562 words). There are no deaths, so had to build characters, feelings, etc. Can call whole thing off if hard to fit in during election year. Would have been easier if Miguel or Antonio had been killed. Mary pretty well destroyed, but it functioning. Finished at 108,746 words. Will get to work on Scribner book for 1961. <num>6250-f </num>

                  <p>Thanks Hotchner for clippings, etc. Glad show went well. Alfred [Rice] appropriately gloomy. Finished 8,000 words in second part of the piece. Goes good, but it will be better when he can get out in boat and get rid of staleness. Not thinking of Dan's book. No plan for serialization, but <title render="italic">Life</title> would have first call since George Plimpton mentioned it to them first. They would be glad to give advance. They did publish <title render="italic">The Old Man and the Sea.</title>  Mary's arm coming along well with massage and therapy. She is optimistic. Hemingway lives in a sort of vacuum of work.

Thinks it OK to take advance payment on it. Discusses future of screen play. Cooper really wants to go into television. Sorry Hotchner is having trouble with censorship on the "K film" [<title render="italic">The Snows of Kilimanjaro</title>]. Hemingway wrote it as morally as he could. No fish in gulf, but good cock fighting, swimming, etc. No faith in play unless big sum of money changes hands. All of those bastards have money instead of blood in their veins.

                  <p> Hopes Zielinski has been receiving his letters. Seems that Zielinski did not receive two of his last letters. Feels uneasy about postal communications. Hemingway would never break off a correspondence even though he is a poor correspondent and is working very hard that his friends get "nothing in proportion to his daily work." Let him know when he receives this letter.

Sending cable to protect from libel. Found out Luis Miguel [Domingu&#205;n] going "hog wild" in Spain on anything to do with horses being sleaved [sic]. The fact everybody knows they are sleaved [sic] means nothing. Legally you would have to prove it and the government won't investigate the ring. Doesn't want to risk <title render="italic">Life </title>with any libel suit. Lots of bad stuff going on. Antonio [Ordez] dealing with plenty sordid stuff: "whole set-up bad." Horn cutting worse than ever, but they crack down when Antonio's bulls are involved. Hemingway doesn't feel too good. <num>6250-f</num>

Asks why Hotchner never cashed the $5000 check. <title render="italic">Life</title> crossed them up; had arguments over the pictures of bullfights. Hemingway "the laughing stock of anyone who knows anything about bull fighting and has seen piece and regarded as the crook and double crosser of all Time." Numerous problems with pictures of bull fighting: "Would rather be smashed up like in Africa any number of times than have the feeling that page of pictures gave me." Hemingway has to try not to think that he is destroyed as an honest guy. Made both a fool and a double crosser after all his care to be true.

Wants to start working and be out of there as soon as he can. She wrote back that Hemingway should not get out until they are sure his cure is complete. Doesn't want repetition of the last three months. Can Hotchner talk to Dr. Cattell about this? She feels Hemingway may need thorough psychoanalysis. Not sure Dr. [Howard] Rome is man to do it, as he never went into depth regarding cause of Hemingway's hallucinations. Maybe transfer Hemingway to Menninger's. Hemingway would have to consent. Repetition of last three months would destroy her in one way or another. <num>6250-f</num>

It is such a bitter, vicious caricature of Sherwood Anderson. Too few are interested in intellectual travesty to ensure him sale of 700 or 800 copies. Would be cruel to publish had they wanted to. They may be wrong. Eager to read <title render="italic">The Sun Also Rises</title> for publication next fall. Discusses jacket for <title render="italic">In Our Time</title>, and says Hemingway wrong to accuse them of exploiting him. He is unknown, and needs blurbs on jacket to attract buyers.

                  <p>Received copy of Speiser's letter, which makes him mad. Discusses his negotiation with Dart and Speiser regarding script. Ingersoll admits that it "is quite true that a playwright's contract gives him the right to insist upon every word of the script that is bought being produced as bought. However, I know of no successful or unsuccessful production which operates on this basis actually." Hemingway apparently not willing to make any concessions. Raising money for production difficult because, since it was a Hemingway play, people "were worried beforehand about how he would behave in rehearsal, and therefore wanted assurances about that behavior, assurances which normally would be taken for granted. Still, Hemingway would be "a hell of a guy to work with, but I nevertheless liked what I saw of him very much." The play should be produced not only because of Hemingway but because of the cause which it is identified. Enclosed in Joseph Losey to Ralph MacA. Ingersoll, 1939 March 24.
