      <p>Chappell was born in Richmond, Virginia, and took his
         Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Richmond. His
         formal art training began at the Art Students League in New
         York. He was on the Board of the Art Students League from
         1927-1931, but left to study for a year under Rudolf Koch at
         his Offenbacher Werkstatt in Germany. In 1932, Chappell
         returned to New York, established his own studio and taught at
         the Art Students League. For about fifteen months in
         1935-1936, he studied with Boardman Robinson at the Colorado
         Springs Fine Arts Center. He kept his studio in New York until
         1951 when he moved to Norwalk, Connecticut. In 1978, Chappell
         moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, where he became the
         Artist-in-Residence at the University of Virginia.</p>
      <p>Isabel Bishop entered the New York School of Applied Design
         for Women in 1918, but soon left to attend the Art Students
         League of New York where she studied painting with Kenneth
         Hayes Miller and Guy Pene du Bois. In 1932, Bishop joined the
         Midtown Galleries Group. Bishop established a studio in New
         York's Union Square in 1934, and became known for her drawings
         and paintings of the various inhabitants of Union Square,
         including working class people, hobos, and drunks. She also
         was appointed as an instructor at the Art Students League in
         1936-1937. In 1934, she married Dr. Harold George Wolff, and
         her son, Remsen, was born in 1940. She was elected to the
         National Academy of Design on April 24, 1941, and the National
         Institute of Arts and Letters in 1944.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection of Warren Chappell (1904- ) letters and
         drawings consists of ca. 370 items, 1932, (1942-1989), chiefly
         letters, frequently illustrated by pen and ink and watercolor
         sketches, from Warren Chappell to Isabel Bishop (Wolff)
         (1902-198[8?]) and David Lawall.</p>
      <p>Chappell's letters to Isabel Bishop reveal a close
         life-long friendship between the two artists. Most of
         Chappell's missives to Bishop include a whimsical drawing
         illustrating the particular topic, season, holiday, or idea
         pertaining to the letter. Some of these drawings were taken
         from preliminary sketches for book illustrations.</p>
      <p>Some topics of interest in the correspondence include: a
         discussion of movement in painting (1972 Sep 17); the planning
         for a showing of Bishop drawings and paintings at the
         Charlottesville Bayly Art Museum (1974 Oct 29; 1975 Feb 26 and
         Mar 17); the termination of Chappell's long-standing working
         relationship as a consultant with the Book of the Month Club
         which had been swallowed up by Time, Inc. (1977 Dec 11); the
         Chatsworth show at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond
         (1979 Oct 2); the Allen Lewis Collection at Wheaton College
         (1979 Oct 29, Nov 25); Chappell's participation in the Art
         Students League and other members (1979 Mar 11; 1983 Aug 5,
         &amp; 21, Oct 1, Nov 4; 1985 Jun 22 and Oct 11); and his
         appointment as Artist-In-Residence at the University of
         Virginia (1979 Nov 25).</p>
      <p>Other topics include: his talk at a seminar on the use of a
         pen in drawing (1980 Sep 15 and Oct 1); his idea of the
         purpose of an Artist-In-Residence at the University of
         Virginia (1981 May 12); a University of Virginia art history
         teacher interested in the Art Students League (1981 Sep 27); a
         discussion of artist friends (1982 Sep 25); diagnosis of
         Parkinson's disease for Bishop (1982 Sep 25); Chappell's
         concept of his own work as an artist (1983 Nov 19); Charles
         and Dorothy Locke (1984 Feb 17, Mar 23, May 29, Nov 18; 1987
         Feb 26, Apr 3); home studios and his past working addresses
         (1984 Mar 7); a doctoral student's interest in Isabel Bishop's
         work (1984 Oct 4); his opinion of "art history" as a field
         (1985 Jan 21); his association with Leopold Tyrmand
         ([1921]-1985) (1985 Mar 23, and Jul 19); his opinion of
         journalism (1985 May 31); Boardman Robinson ([1876]-?)
         concerning 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Vanity Fair</title>(1985 Nov 29); his
         association with Boardman Robinson (1986 Feb 22, and Jul 4);
         his grandfather's founding of the Socialist Party in Richmond,
         Virginia (1986 Jul 4); and his association with Joseph
         Pennell, an instructor at the Art Students League, and
         consultant work with Knopf and Book of the Month Club (1987
         May 16).</p>
      <p>The letters from Warren Chappell to David Lawall of the
         Bayly Art Museum, Charlottesville, Virginia, are also usually
         illustrated with pen and ink drawings and watercolors. The
         following topics are included: a discussion of his
         illustrations for

         improvements in the University of Virginia Art Department
         (1977 Jun 13); suggestions for which artists to show in the
         Bayly Art Museum (1979 Aug 24); Dickie Ponsette-Dart (1979 Sep
         27); the Charles Locke estate (1981 Feb 1); his experience
         with the parochial Art Department at the University of
         Virginia (1981 May 1); the attitude of Chappell towards
         fund-raising for art (1983 Apr 20); and Edger Wind (1988 Feb
         11).</p>
