         <famname>Saunders Family</famname>, and 
         <famname>Watts Family</famname>. Large portions of the
         correspondence belong to 
         <persname>William Watts</persname>and 
         <persname>Fleming Saunders</persname>. Included with the
         correspondence is a letterbook, 1873-1880, of 
         <persname>Frank Prufer</persname>. The business papers include
         accounts, bonds, correspondence, and notes and receipts,
         chiefly pertaining to 
         <persname>William Watts</persname>and 
         <persname>Fleming Saunders</persname>, but also various
         members of these families. The legal papers include court
         dockets and memoranda of 
         <persname>William Watts</persname>, documents, and wills.
         There are various legal papers of 
         <persname>William Watts</persname>pertaining to

      <p>Correspondence</p>
      <p>From the correspondence of the 
         <famname>Davis Family</famname>, 
         <famname>Saunders Family</famname>, and related families,
         1800-1856, there is a letter addressed to "Sully," December
         30, 1800, from 
         <geogname>Louisa County</geogname>, which advises the
         recipient, who had asked for religious instruction, to seek
         the 
         <corpname>Kingdom of God</corpname>. A letter dated April 2,
         1812 from 
         <persname>James Rayland</persname>to his sister mentions that
         his cousin is strapped for cash, and asks if the recipient can
         help him. A rather unusual letter, dating July 24, 1836, from 
         <geogname>Mount Pleasant</geogname>, indicates that "Mary
         thinks a little Brandy would be of service to her," and
         requests that some be sent to her. A letter written to Captain
         Davis on January 9, 1844, mentions that 
         <corpname>Pleasant Milkhill</corpname>needs brandy, and asks
         that it be sent with 
         <persname>David</persname>(probably a slave) for there is none
         at 
         <corpname>Bethel</corpname>. A letter dating November 6, 1856
         at 
         <corpname>Bleak Hills</corpname>makes a reference to "Roanoke"
         [Roanoke County, or 
         <persname>John Randolph</persname>'s estate "Roanoke"?].</p>
      <p>From their correspondence dating 1862-1904, there is a
         letter to 
         <persname>Sam Tyree</persname>, Esq, July 17, 1870 from [his]
         student: 
         <persname>[Sam L. Preston?]</persname>complaining that he can
         not attend sunday school because of prostration. There is also
         a letter dated April 8, 1901 from 
         <corpname>Trinity and Ivy Chapel</corpname>in 
         <geogname>Boonsboro, Bedford County</geogname>to a Mr.
         Randolph inviting him to preach there every other Sunday.
         There is also an undated fragment referring to a comet the
         size of a full moon and a meteor shower which "will be a sight
         to see."</p>
      <p>Among the families' undated correspondence, is a letter
         dated November 17 to 
         <persname>"Carter" [Saunders?]</persname>, by a female who
         mentions [her] children's Latin lessons. There is another
         letter to a Miss Kerr which mentions a recipe for Tongue a la
         Mode. There is also a letter, dated October 23, [1805?], from
         a 
         <persname>Sam K. Jenny</persname>, probably a doctor of
         medicine, which mentions that 
         <persname>William Green</persname>attended a man named
         Barnhart to 
         <geogname>Bedford</geogname>so Jenny could prescribe to his
         case and that he "forbad the case of ardent spirits."</p>
      <p>From the correspondence of 
         <persname>Eva (Smith) Saunders</persname>, dated 1868-1894,
         there is a letter, February 24, 1889, from 
         <corpname>The Grove</corpname>which mentions that while Eva
         passed her exams--her brother 
         <persname>Fleming Saunders III</persname>did not. A letter,
         August 2, 1892, to 
         <persname>Eva Saunders</persname>from 
         <persname>M. Natalie Manson</persname>, at 
         <corpname>Wintore</corpname>, speaks of school and Latin.
         There is an interesting letter, December 10, 1893, from 
         <geogname>Florence, Italy</geogname>to Eva, mentioning that
         there is no silver in 
         <geogname>Italy</geogname>for the English and French are
         buying it up, that "Coppers are such a bother, and so heavy to
         carry," seeing the works of 
         <persname>Donato</persname>and 
         <persname>Brunelleschi</persname>and the 
         <corpname>Medici Chapel</corpname>, and the 
         <corpname>"Brothers of Pity"</corpname>who wear black robes
         and carry a corpse which "made my blood turn cold." There is a
         letter, January 13, 1894, to Eva, which mentions sending a
         book to 
         <persname>May Begg</persname>, "a literary courtship under the
         auspices of 
         <geogname>Pike's Peak</geogname>. " 
         <persname>Fleming Saunders III</persname>at 
         <corpname>Randolph-Macon Academy</corpname>in 
         <geogname>Bedford</geogname>writes to Eva on May 15, 1894,
         saying he tried to get a tennis tournament for field day, and
         congratulates Eva on her chicken raising and hopes his are
         doing better.</p>
      <p>Among the 
         <persname>Eva Saunders</persname>undated correspondence, there
         is a fragment which notes that Miss Begg sent to its writer a
         little book called "The greatest thing in the World." A letter
         dated November 26 to Eva contains drawings of women's blouses
         and concerns her ordered blouses.</p>
      <p>From the correspondence of 
         <persname>Fleming Saunders</persname>and 
         <persname>Mary (Gwathmey) Saunders</persname>, 1858-1879, a
         letter dated September 5, 1871, from 
         <persname>Peter Saunders, Jr.</persname>, 
         <corpname>Bleak Hill</corpname>, says that his tobacco crop
         has suffered. Another letter, April 17, 1874, from 
         <persname>Jeanie Edmond</persname>, 
         <corpname>Hudson Lodge</corpname>, makes a reference to the 
         <corpname>Jubilee Singers</corpname>traveling to raise money
         for a "slave college somewhere in the Northern States"; to
         acquaintances visiting 
         <geogname>England</geogname>, mentioning a "public worship
         bill" in 
         <corpname>Parliament</corpname>, and one acquaintance having
         an appointment with the Bishop of 
         <geogname>Melbourne</geogname>; and to visiting 
         <geogname>Australia</geogname>. In a postcard dated August 21,
         1879, 
         <persname>W. A. Alrich</persname>asks 
         <persname>Fleming Saunders</persname>' opinion as to the next
         "services" in "regular course," and saying that it best not to
         alter rotation as "last service was omitted." He also mentions
         that Mrs. 
         <persname>C[harles] Dabney</persname>has a fine little
         daughter.</p>
      <p>In the Fleming and Mary Saunders correspondence, 1880-1892,
         there is a letter dated March 3, 1880 from M. Caden to
         Saunders stating that he can not board a minister, but will

         <persname>Peter Saunders</persname>writes from 
         <corpname>Bleak Hill</corpname>on January 19, 1881 saying that
         he has no specific desire to be a director on the 
         <corpname>Virgina Midland [Rail] Road</corpname>, and does not
         think he could get the appointment anyway; he is still a
         director on the 
         <corpname>Franklin and Pittsylvania Railroad
         Company</corpname>, and fears a possible conflict of interest.
         <persname>W. A. Alrich</persname>writes from 
         <corpname>Emanuel Rectory</corpname>, 
         <geogname>Chatham, Virginia</geogname>, on February 16, 1882,
         saying he is glad that the 
         <famname>Saunders</famname>' keep up the old St. Valentine's
         Day tradition, by sending so practical a token of affection. 
         <persname>Ellen Boulder</persname>, a school teacher, writes
         to

         <geogname>Drake's Branch</geogname>on March 18, 1889,

      <p>In the Fleming and Mary Saunders correspondence, 1901-1910,

         <geogname>Kentucky</geogname>are good, the inconveniences are
         many, and that the doomsayers will probably prevent the

         to the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Graphic,</title>a ladies society
         magazine. There is an undated list of books from 
         <corpname>George Munro, Publishers</corpname>. There is also a
         broadside for "The World's Christmas Hymn"--an analogy of
         English poetry pertaining to 
         <persname>Christ</persname>'s birth dating from the medieval
         period.</p>
      <p>The church related papers include a letter, March 21, 1904,
         from 
         <corpname>Virginia Polytechnic Institute</corpname>to the 
         <famname>Saunders</famname>asking for aid for the building of
         an Episcopal parsonage at the university. The letter
         enunciates a fear of the danger of Episcopal boys being weaned
         from their faith by the compulsory attendance at the services
         of other sects due to the absence of a Episcopal parsonage.
         There is also an Episcopal "Church Kalendar," 1882-1883,
         listing holy days with information on the faith, church
         service, and background of the Anglican/Episcopalian
         faith.</p>
      <p>Civil War papers range from 1861 to 1864. During 1862-1864,
         there are a number of furloughs issued to 
         <corpname>Confederate</corpname>enlisted men in 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>, each with a physical
         description of the bearer, and addressed "to all whom it may
         concern." On August 10, 1862, there is a provision return for
         a company of the 
         <corpname>13th Regiment of Pennsylvania volunteers</corpname>.
         There are also a number of CSA "special requisitions", chiefly
         ordering clothing, shoes, and blankets, most signed by Captain
         <persname>Fleming Saunders</persname>, assistant
         quartermaster, of Company K, Virginia Regiment.</p>
      <p>The educational papers range from 1848-1903, n.d. There is
         a page from a 1848 French edition of the fables of La Fontaine
         from the "Academie de Norfolk." There is an 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">"Educational Treatise on the Constitution"</title>,
         September 6, 1877, by 
         <persname>John Randolph Tucker</persname>of 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>. There is a 1892-1893 brochure
         for the 
         <corpname>Edgeworth School</corpname>, a church-related
         boarding and day school for females. There is the fall term
         1895 grade report from 
         <corpname>Virginia Polytechnic Institute</corpname>(formerly 
         <corpname>Virginia Agriculture and Mechanical
         College</corpname>) for 
         <persname>Fleming Saunders, III</persname>. There is a fall
         term 1902 grade report from 
         <corpname>Hollins College</corpname>for 
         <persname>Elsie Saunders</persname>. There is another VPI
         grade report, from February 1903, for 
         <persname>Carter Temple Saunders</persname>. There is a report
         from 
         <corpname>St. Timothy's School</corpname>of 
         <geogname>Catonsville, Maryland</geogname>. Another undated
         piece is a "rules for spelling" sheet from a grammar book.
         There are also undated fragments of Latin, French, and
         algebra.</p>
      <p>There are lectures, essays, and poems, 1794, 1818, 1843,
         and n.d., including a scrap of a lecture dated September 6,
         1794 from 
         <persname>Edward Watts</persname>; another lecture on motive
         dated September 16, 1794; and, a series of oral essays from
         1843.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous material, 1887-1892, includes a note of the
         marriage of Capt. 
         <persname>Fleming Saunders</persname>to 
         <persname>Mary Gwathmey</persname>on July 30.</p>
      <p>The obituaries include a reprint of the 1858 obituary of 
         <persname>Fleming Saunders, Sr</persname>, a reprint of the
         1867 obituary of Fleming, Sr.'s wife-- 
         <persname>Alice Fleming</persname>--and the 1904 obituary of 
         <persname>Peter Saunders</persname>. The obituaries of
         Fleming, Sr. and Alice are panegyrics. The first two were
         transcribed by 
         <persname>John Blair Dabney</persname>.</p>
      <p>The photographs include an unidentified photograph of a
         young member of the

         which is based on the kings of 
         <geogname>England</geogname>who reigned down to its date, is
         also present. The card for Henry V is missing. Many of the
         cards contain information of the kings of an antiquarian
         nature.</p>

         sends three paupers--one white woman and two black woman--to
         the poor house. Expenses for the poor house are noted. At 1874
