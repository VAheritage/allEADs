      <p>In a series of letters to Robert England of the Oglethorpe
         University Press Pound discusses potential reviewers for "A
         draft of xxx cantos," mentioning Joseph Hergesheimer and
         William E. Woodward; disparages James Joyce, S[ylvia?] Beach,
         Oliver Sprague, incompetents in the Roosevelt administration;
         emphasizes the importance of understanding economic theory;
         praises Irving Fisher's "Stamp Scrip," Leo Frobenius, texts by
         William E. Woodward and Christopher Hollis; advocates the
         printing of affordable books written by the American founders;
         discusses types of printing presses and the necessity of the
         New Deal providing presses for writers; advises an edition of
         Frobenius and other translations of classics with his Guido
         Cavalcanti as a model. He also mentions McNair Wilson, Random
         House, "The New English Weekly," John Gould Fletcher, C. H.
         Douglas's book "Social credit," William Brockman Bankhead,
         orchestral music and George Anthiel.</p>
      <p>There is an additional letter to the editor of
         "Westminster" asking that an article be corrected and
         disagreeing with "Bacon".</p>
      <p>With these is "A plan for a regional printing press" by
         England corrected by Pound, written for submission to the
         Works Progress Administration.</p>
