         are comprised chiefly of his notes, poetry, and manuscripts
         concerning his study of the "greatest Dutch poet," Joost van
         den Vondel (1587-1679), but also include letters from Leonard
         Charles Van Noppen to his family concerning his trip to the

         Noppen; news clippings; an application form to the U.S. State

         Leonard Charles Van Noppen in his U.S.N.R. uniform, at the
         Hague, July 27, 1918, by Th.</p>
      <p>Van Noppen was born in the Netherlands eight miles from
         Antwerp but came with his parents to the United States when he
         was six year old, settling near Greensboro, North Carolina,
         and becoming an American citizen. His education included an
         A.B. at Guilford College in 1890, graduating from the
         University of North Carolina in 1892, and post graduate work
         at Haverford College, Pennsylvania, receiving his A.M. in
         1893.</p>
      <p>He returned to the University of North Carolina to study
         law and was admitted to the North Carolina bar in 1894. From
         1895-1897, Van Noppen spent two years in residence in the
         Netherlands as a special student of Dutch Literature, which
         was his field of expertise while a professor at Columbia
         University. All the correspondence from Leonard Charles Van
         Noppen deal with his experiences during his trip to the
         Netherlands to study.</p>
      <p>Letters from Leonard Charles Van Noppen to his family,
         Charles, John, and Miss Addie, begin with his voyage to
         England from New York aboard the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Teutonic</title>which he describes in
         great and vivid detail and includes a summary of the various
         sites which he visited such as the Westminster Abbey, the
         Tower of London, Hyde Park, the British Museum, and Parliament
         (1894 Dec 26-1895 Jan 10). He also discusses his financial
         status with his brother Charles throughout his letters.
         Leonard Charles Van Noppen arrived in the Netherlands on
         January 9, 1895. His letters from the Netherlands are full of
         description of the cities and landscape, Dutch life and
         customs, and his experiences. He stayed in Amsterdam (1895 Jan
         10-Feb 10; see 1895 Apr 4 for a description of Amsterdam, the
         Royal Palace, Dutch painters, and history) and the Hague (1895
         Apr 4) and traveled to visit his Dutch relatives whom he had
         never seen (1895 May 28). He visits Middleburg to convalesce
         from an illness (1895 Sep 6); and Schoondyke (1895 Sep 11);
         and describes his work in translating Joost van den Vondel's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Lucifer</title>(1896 Feb 18, Jun 5
         &amp; 30) which was originally published in 1898 and made his
         reputation as a Dutch scholar.</p>
      <p>Letters to Leonard Charles Van Noppen include the following
         correspondents: Ambassador Andrew D. White, Germany,(1898,
         1903); Walter H. Page, Doubleday, Page, &amp; Co. (1900); A.
         Lawrence Lowell, Harvard University (1901); Th. Molkenboer,
         Amsterdam (1913, 1916, 1918); Benoy Kumar Sarkar (1915 Jan 4,
         May 20, Dec 10; 1920 Apr 5); Admiral Beresford (1918 Oct 25);
         Lord Burnham (1919 May 20); Countess Villefranche (1920 Sep
         27); Helen Sybella Cosway (n.y. Dec 29); and Walter Pulitzer
         (n.y. Apr 21; n.d.). Subjects in these letters include:
         arranged marriages (1915 Dec 10); the philosophy of Max Weber
         (1915 Jan 4); the significance of World War I in history (1916
         Feb 5); and a discussion about art (1918 Aug 17).</p>
      <p>One letter, [May ?] 1916, has seven engravings by Jakob
         Houbraken (1698-1780) enclosed, including engravings of Pieter
         Jan Marcus, J. Blauw, Willem I, Daniel de Dieu, Willem
         Fredrik, Francois Maalzon, and Johan Meerman.</p>
