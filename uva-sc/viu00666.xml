        <p>The Leftwich Papers were placed on loan in the Library
            by Mr. William A. Irvine of Evington, Virginia, through W.
            E. Leftwich on March 29, 1934.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Leftwich Papers consist of ca. 2500 items (4 Hollinger
         boxes, ca. 1.3 linear shelf feet), 1780-1890, and reflect the
         military, business and personal activities of Joel Leftwich
         (1759-1846). The collection contains correspondence, financial
         and legal papers, printed material, and miscellaneous related
         papers. Correspondence and business papers comprise the bulk
         of the collection but there is a significant amount of
         material relating to the operations of the Twelfth Virginia Militia Brigade from 1790
         to 1842. A genealogy of the Leftwich family may be found in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Campbell Chronicles and Family Sketches: Embracing the History of Campbell County, Virginia 1782-1926</title> by Ruth H. Early.</p>
      <p>Leftwich was the son of 
          Augustine Leftwich (?-1795) and was born
         in Bedford County, Virginia. His brothers included 
          James Leftwich,  
          Jesse Leftwich,  
          Augustine Leftwich Jr.,  and 
          Jabez Leftwich . His own son, 
          Jack Leftwich,  and five grandchildren are
         mentioned in the family correspondence: 
          Joel B. Leftwich,  
          Sarah A. Leftwich,  
          Mary L. Leftwich (Fuqua),  
          Ann Leftwich (Goode) and 
          Ethelinda Leftwich . Most of the
         correspondence concerns local and family events. There is an
         interesting group of letters between Joel B. Leftwich and his
         friends concerning college life at Randolph-Macon College during the 1840's
         and their perceptions of the women they were courting.</p>
      <p>Correspondence concerning Virginia politics during the early
         nineteenth century in Richmond (principally letters from Jabez
         to Joel Leftwich) begins in the year 1806. One letter of
         interest concerns the itinerary for the visit by the Marquis
         de Lafayette in 1824. Leftwich, as were many of his Bedford neighbors, was a supporter of the old Whig Party; his correspondents include House of Delegates
         member 
          William Campbell,  Senator 
          Isaac Otey,  
          P. M. Goggin,  
          Walter Taylor,  and General 
          Joseph Martin who discusses President 
          Thomas Jefferson 's opinion concerning the
         maintaining of a standing army (April 17, 1803). Leftwich
         himself served as a member of the Virginia General Assembly
         and a few of his letters pertain to his legislative career as
         represented by an April 4, 1841 letter to President 
          John Tyler recommending the appointment of
          William Norvell as U.S. consul at Rio de Janeiro.</p>
      <p>Also present are several writings and speeches by Leftwich
         on a variety of subjects including the Revolutionary War, and
         the need for religious conversion of Indians. Joel B. Leftwich
         was a member of a debating society and his speeches on
         temperance, good memory, and other topics are present in these
         papers. Leftwich himself subscribed to Niles Weekly Register
         and several issues from 1815 to 1839 are present in this
         collection. Of special interest are manuscript notes on the
         Virginia Convention called for the purpose of ratifying the
         Federal Constitution in June 1788; these notes consist of
         remarks made by such participants as Patrick Henry and James
         Madison.</p>
      <p>The financial and legal aspects of Leftwich's life had two
         major components: as a gentleman farmer and horse breeder and
         as a justice of the peace for Bedford County. Bills and receipts from
         1789 to 1843 are in the collection along with tax statements
         for several members of his family regarding horses and slaves.
         Horses were of great concern to the family and there are
         numerous mentions in the correspondence on their trade,
         breeding, and racing. There are several items pertaining to a
         stud horse named "Pilgrim" which had been purchased in 1795
         from 
          Daniel Nance of Lincoln County, North Carolina for the sum
         of five hundred dollars. Other papers include a bill of sale
         as to the horse's pedigree and a broadside attesting to his
         value and price.</p>
      <p>Tax statements for the year 1802 depict Joel Leftwich as
         the owner of seven slaves for which he paid a tax of $13.90
         (the tax for "Pilgrim" was ten dollars). Other documents
         pertain to the hiring of his slaves, and legal dispensations
         of them for the payment of debts, 1796-1826. Among these is a
         complaint against a slave named 
          Bill who was owned by Jesse Leftwich. The
         slave had shot a dog belonging to his owner's brother
         Augustine and Joel Leftwich, as justice of the peace, issued a
         warrant for his arrest. Legal documents including wills,
         indentures, subpoenas, arrest warrants and other related
         materials are in this group of papers. One group of letters
         described the apprehension of a man believed to have been be
         insane and of his transfer to a lunatic asylum. The remaining
         items are primarily concerned with Leftwich's routine duties
         as a justice of the peace.</p>
      <p>Leftwich's military service is represented by militia
         returns, muster rolls, general and brigade orders, drill
         parade memorandum, and courts-martial papers. His brother,
         Jabez, who later became a member of Congress, served with him
         as a brigade inspector. Notable correspondents include 
          William Henry Harrison,  
          William Barbour,  
          Claiborne W. Gooch,  and 
          Richard Crooks . Leftwich began his
         military career during the Revolutionary War when he enlisted
         as an ensign and fought at the battles of Germantown, Camden, and Guilford Court House where he was wounded.
         During the War of 1812 the Virginia militia was called to the
         defense of Richmond following the burning of Washington, D.C.
         on August 24, 1814. Upon the death of General Joseph Martin,
         Leftwich was elected by the Virginia General Assembly as a
         brigadier general of the Twelfth Brigade of militia which
         consisted of the 4th, 10th, 18th, 43rd, 53rd, 64th, 91st, and
         110th regiments. He commanded a force of militia under William
         Henry Harrison, commander of the Army of the Northwest during
         the war. A group of letters between the two men provides
         information on a little-known event. Harrison apparently
         ordered Leftwich to continue the building of an eight-acre
         stockade on the Maumee River at Fort Meigs, Ohio. He disobeyed orders by
         departing for home before Harrison's arrival and the fort's
         completion. As a result, American forces were defeated near
         the area but Leftwich's military career was undamaged.</p>
      <p>In the correspondence for the 1820's and 1830's are
         numerous invitations to Leftwich requesting his presence at
         military dinners, barbecues, and honorary functions. In later
         years Leftwich, a major general of militia, sought to have his
         federal military pension increased and 
          William Leftwich Goggin,  a Whig who
         represented a district in Bedford County in Congress,
         presented a petition on his behalf to that body. General
         Leftwich died on April 20, 1846, in Bedford County.</p>
      <p>The collection is arranged chronologically in three series:
         I. Military Papers, II. Legal and Business, and, III.
         Correspondence and Miscellaneous.</p>
