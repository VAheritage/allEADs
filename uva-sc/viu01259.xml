      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers of John Hooe, Jr. of Prince William County,
         Virginia, who served as a delegate to the Virginia House of
         Delegates, consists of ca. 150 items (1 Hollinger box) ca.
         1685-1855, and contains correspondence, legal &amp; financial
         papers, and three bound volumes, including two account ledgers
         from Hooe's blacksmith shop. The earlier blacksmith account
         ledger, ca. 1812-1832, also contains copies of wills, "A List
         of Voters in Prince William County April 5, 1819," farm
         records concerning wheat, corn, and hogs, mentioning Bradley
         Farm, Graham Park, Yorkshire Farm, Locust Grove, Hansfarm,
         Cancer Farm, and Bloom's Grove, miscellaneous recipes and
         notes, and a slave hire for John from Mrs. Susannah F. Graham
         (1831 Jan 7). The farm ledger, 1842-1845, belonging to [John
         Hooe, Jr.?] also has accounts for the Toll Road [Hunting Creek
