        <p>This collection was a gift to the Library on August 11,
            1988, by William Keene Langhorne of Portola Valley,
            California; Harry Forsyth Langhorne of Lowesville,
            Virginia; and, Phyllis Langhorne Draper of Charlottesville,
            Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection contains seven photographs, ante 1920, of
         "Nydrie," Esmont, Albemarle County, Virginia, including views
         of the parlour and the main hall and one of the exterior. In
         addition, there is a copy of an article, September 22, 1898,
         about the building of the main residence, "WILL MAKE A GRAND
         ESTATE/What Mr. Forsyth is Doing on the Southside," 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Weekly Chronicle</title>of
         Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>
      <p>The estate is located in the Green Mountain section of
         Albemarle County, and now contains some seven hundred acres of
         land. This tract of land was originally formed by the Coles
         estate, which was patented by John Coles II of Hanover County
         in 1769 from a 3,000-acre tract purchased from the Epps Grant,
         and was named for the Coles family seat in Leinster,
         Ireland.</p>
      <p>During the 1890's, Harry Douglas Forsyth, a sugar grower
         and manufacturer, of New Orleans, Louisiana, bought the old
         estate of Thomas Coles, and, in 1898, had the main residence
         built. "Nydrie" is built of brick, with brown stone trimmings,
         and slate roof; and, it includes the main entrance hall, a
         music gallery, basement rooms, and fifty other rooms,
         including a dining room, a billiard room, a library, a drawing
         room, six storerooms, and two pantries. Prior to the
         construction of the mansion, he built several dwellings for
         employees, a large barn and stable of brick with a slate roof,
         and a dam forming a lake of pure spring water. After his death
         in 1902, Forsyth's wife, Sarah Rice (Johnson) Forsyth,
         continued to live at "Nydrie" until her death in 1920.
         Following her death, the estate was sold; it has since been
         acquired by the Daniel G. Van Clief family.</p>
      <p>There are additional photographs of "Nydrie" in accessions
         #3070-e and #10648, as well as some historical information
         concerning the estate in the former collection.</p>
