         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>These two pocket diaries, 1853 and 1860, were kept by 
         <persname>Philip St. George Cocke</persname>of 
         <corpname>Belmead</corpname>, 
         <geogname>Powhatan County, Virginia</geogname>. The 1853 diary
         discusses matters of a personal nature while the 1860 diary
         discusses his involvement with the 
         <corpname>Virginia Military Institute</corpname>as President
         of its Board of Visitors and as Chairman of the Armory
         Commission.</p>
         <p>The first diary contains entries from August 11-18, 1853,
         which discuss a journey from 
         <corpname>Belmead</corpname>to 
         <geogname>Warm Springs, Bath County, Virginia</geogname>with
         stops at 
         <corpname>Bremo</corpname>, 
         <geogname>Fluvanna County</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Lexington</geogname>. During his visit at 
         <geogname>Lexington</geogname>and tour of the 
         <corpname>Virginia Military Institute</corpname>, Cocke saw 
         <persname>John B[owdoin Cocke</persname>] who had entered
         V.M.I. as a cadet two weeks earlier. He mentions the many
         improvements shown to him by Superintendent 
         <persname>Francis H. Smith</persname>, such as the new society
         rooms of the cadets, the new wing of the barracks, and the
         design of the new mess hall. Upon leaving 
         <geogname>Lexington</geogname>, he travelled on to 
         <geogname>Warm Springs</geogname>, where he mentions meeting
         his old 
         <corpname>West Point</corpname>instructor, 
         <persname>Edward H. Courteney</persname>, currently a
         professor at the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>, along with 
         <persname>James L. Cabell</persname>, another University
         professor. He mentions the arrival of servants with a carriage
         buggy and four horses. The next few entries contain brief
         notes about the weather. The beginning of this diary also
         contains notes on 
         <geogname>Warm Springs</geogname>property, the 
         <corpname>Warm Springs Company</corpname>(incorporated in
         1815), and touches on the subject of slaves owned by the
         Company, capitol, and acreage, and mentions Brockenbrough,
         Taylor, and Patterson.</p>
         <p>The 1860 diary contains entries from April 25 through May
         3, and discusses a meeting in 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>of the Board of Visitors of the 
         <corpname>Virginia Military Institute</corpname>and subsequent
         plans and courses of action. The April 26 meeting was held in
         the office of Adjunct-General 
         <persname>William H. Richardson</persname>, and was also
         attended by Col. 
         <persname>William McLaughlin</persname>, Col. 
         <persname>Samuel Downing</persname>, and Col. 
         <persname>Francis H. Smith</persname>. During the meeting,
         they adopted a resolution authorizing Superintendent Smith to
         proceed with recommendations outlined in his report to the
         Board on ["Scientific Education in Europe"] and later
         submitted to the General Assembly. The Act of March 28, 1860,
         increased the annuity to V.M.I., and the sum of $20,000 was
         specifically appropriated for building purposes. Another
         meeting that afternoon was attended by Gen. 
         <persname>George Blow</persname>and Col. 
         <persname>William H. Payne</persname>in addition to the
         others. There is some discussion of meetings of the Armory
         Commission consisting of Cocke, Col. 
         <persname>Francis H. Smith</persname>, and Capt. 
         <persname>George W. Randolph</persname>. Randolph reported
         that 
         <persname>[James T.] Ames</persname>responded favorably to
         their proposition and offered to furnish weapons machinery
         used for rolling [musket barrels?]. On April 27, the
         Commission discussed plans for organizing and operating an
         armory, a decision to examine the 
         <corpname>Springfield Armory</corpname>and visit Ames' works
         at 
         <geogname>Chicopee, Massachusetts</geogname>, and the
         reorganization of the State Armory. 
         <persname>[Henry A.] du Pont</persname>furnished a plan and
         specification for building a powder magazine, and the
         Commission resolved to purchase $10,000 worth of powder. On
         April 30, the subjects of the patented breech loading rifle, a
         new English pistol, and the 
         <corpname>Massachusetts Fire Arm Company</corpname>at 
         <geogname>Chicopee</geogname>are mentioned. On May 1, the
         Commission toured the 
         <corpname>Frankfort Arsenal</corpname>in 
         <geogname>Pennsylvania</geogname>where machinery for making
         musket and pistol percussion caps was seen. The discussion
         includes costs and operation by steam-engine. Cocke also
         mentions the "Pyrotechny &amp; Military Laboratory" at V.M.I.,
         and the amount of gunpowder contracted and to be deported to
         the magazines at 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Lexington</geogname>. He also notes that du Pont was
         a classmate of Smith's at 
         <corpname>West Point</corpname>, and that he met one of his
         own classmates, 
         <persname>Tench Tilghman</persname>of 
         <geogname>Maryland</geogname>. On May 3, the Commission
         travelled to 
         <geogname>Springfield</geogname>to see Ames in connection with
         the manufacture of sabers at 
         <geogname>Chicopee</geogname>. They met with Major 
         <persname>[William Anderson?] Thornton</persname>of the 
         <corpname>United States Army</corpname>, who had just
         completed his inspection of 1,000 cavalry sabers made by Ames
         for 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>. Ames agreed to meet them at his
         works at 
         <geogname>Chicopee</geogname>, where the Commission had a tour
         during which they saw the operation of machinery by water and
         the machine shops with wrought iron and specimens of hinge
         castings. Cocke mentions that Ames makes many crossfield guns
         and howitzers for the 
         <geogname>United States</geogname>Government, and is
         manufacturing the rifle-musket for the Queen of 
         <geogname>Spain</geogname>. The end of the diary contains an
         expense account for this period as well as a few newspaper
         clippings about armories and weapons.</p>
