      <p><persname>Micajah Woods</persname>, the son of 
         <persname>John Rodes Woods</persname>and 
         <persname>Sabina Lewis Stewart Creigh</persname>, was born on
         May 17, 1844, at "

         <geogname>Ivy Depot</geogname>, in 
         <geogname>Albemarle County, Virginia</geogname>. The eldest
         son of a family of ten children, he received his early
         education at 
         <corpname>Lewisburg Academy</corpname>, the military school at
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>, and the 
         <corpname>Bloomfield Academy</corpname>. In August 1861, at

         <persname>John B. Floyd</persname>in 
         <geogname>West Virginia</geogname>. He spent the winter of
         1861-1862 at the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>, being under
         military age. In May 1862, Woods joined the 
         <corpname>Second Virginia Cavalry (Co. K)</corpname>and fought
         under 
         <persname>"Stonewall" Jackson</persname>at 
         <geogname>Port Republic</geogname>, under 
         <persname>J. E. B. Stuart</persname>in the Northern 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>raids, and in the battles of

         <geogname>Crampton's Gap</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Sharpsburg</geogname>.</p>

         cavalry in the 
         <corpname>Virginia State Line</corpname>, recently organized
         by General Floyd. He spent the winter of 1862-1863 involved in
         campaigns in 
         <geogname>West Virginia</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Kentucky</geogname>. From April 1863, to the close
         of the war he served as first lieutenant in 
         <corpname>Jackson's (Virginia) Horse Artillery</corpname>,
         participating in the battle of 
         <geogname>Gettysburg</geogname>, July 3, 1863, and the battles
         of 
         <geogname>New Market</geogname>, Second 
         <geogname>Cold Harbor</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Lynchburg</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Fisher's Hill</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Monocacy</geogname>.</p>
      <p>After the war he returned to the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>where he studied
         for three sessions, receiving a Bachelor of Law degree in
         June, 1868. He began his practice in 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>; and, in 1870 was elected
         commonwealth attorney, a position he held until his death in
         1911. In 1881 Woods was elected and commissioned captain of
         the 
         <corpname>Monticello Guard</corpname>, and commanded the
         company at the 
         <corpname>Yorktown Centennial</corpname>in October of that
         year. In 1889, the 
         <corpname>John Bowie Strange Camp, United Confederate
         Veterans</corpname>, was organized with Woods as commander. In
         1909 he served as president of the 
         <corpname>Virginia State Bar Association</corpname>.</p>
      <p>On June 9, 1874, Woods married 
         <persname normal="Matilda Minor Morris">Matilda ("Tillie")
         Minor Morris</persname>, the second daughter of

         <corpname>Clazemont</corpname>, " 
         <geogname>Hanover County, Virginia</geogname>. They had five

         son, disappeared after 1902 and apparently died sometime
         before 1911. The Woods' daughters were renowned for their
         beauty; 
         <persname>Maud Coleman Woods</persname>was one of the two
         women chosen to typify the beauty of North and South America
         on the official emblem of the

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection, consisting of ca. 760 items, (5 Hollinger
         boxes, 22-1/2 linear shelf inches), includes the papers of the
         <famname>Woods Family</famname>of 
         <geogname>Albemarle County, Virginia</geogname>, from 1847 to
         1926. Correspondence comprises the major part of the
         collection and deals with a variety of subjects. The
         correspondence between 
         <persname>Micajah Woods</persname>and his parents during the
         Civil War includes detailed descriptions of the campaigns and
         battles in which he fought, among them the battles of 
         <geogname>Port Republic</geogname>, Second 
         <geogname>Manassas</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Crampton's Gap</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Sharpsburg</geogname>, 
         <geogname>New Market</geogname>, Second 
         <geogname>Cold Harbor</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Lynchburg</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Fisher's Hill</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Monocacy</geogname>. The men under whom he served
         included 
         <persname>"Stonewall" Jackson</persname>, 
         <persname>J. E. B. Stuart</persname>, and 
         <persname>John Floyd</persname>. A portion of the post-Civil
         War correspondence regards Civil War Veterans' Reunions and
         recollections of battles and campaigns.</p>
      <p>The correspondence between members of the 
         <famname>Woods Family</famname>mainly concerns family matters
         such as the 1864 execution by Union soldiers of 
         <persname>David S. Creigh</persname>, 
         <persname>Micajah Woods</persname>' uncle, and the selection
         of Woods' daughter, 
         <persname>Maud Coleman Woods</persname>, as the first Miss
         America in 1901. Correspondence regarding the
         Pleasants-Ritchie duel of 1847 includes an eye-witness
         description. A separate section of the correspondence deals
         with genealogy, principally that of the 
         <famname>Woods</famname>, 
         <famname>Buster</famname>, 
         <famname>Rodes</famname>, and 
         <famname>McDowell</famname>families. The major family
         correspondents are 
         <persname>Micajah Woods</persname>; his parents, Dr. 
         <persname>John Rodes Woods</persname>and 
         <persname>Sabina Lewis Stewart Creigh Woods</persname>; Woods'
         wife, 
         <persname>Matilda ("Tillie") Minor Morris</persname>; and his
         children--Morris, Sallie, Maud, Mary Watts, and Lettie.</p>
      <p>The papers are of several kinds and deal with numerous
         topics. There are two Civil War diaries belonging to 
         <persname>Micajah Woods</persname>, one entitled "Sketches of
         the Campaign of General Floyd," Woods' class notes, his 1864
         account book, certificates, and notes regarding genealogy.
         There is an article written by 
         <persname>Micajah Woods</persname>about 
         <persname>Abraham Lincoln</persname>and copies of several
         speeches delivered by 
         <persname>Micajah Woods</persname>. These include an address
         to the 
         <corpname>Augusta Memorial Association</corpname>in 
         <geogname>Staunton, Virginia</geogname>; "Woman and Vacation,"
         which was delivered at the 
         <corpname>Albemarle Baptist Female Institute</corpname>in
         1890; an address he made at the 1895 Great Confederate Reunion
         in 
         <geogname>Lewisburg, West Virginia</geogname>; the memo of a
         speech given before "colored people"; a speech to the 
         <corpname>Washington Society of the University of
         Virginia</corpname>; and a copy of the address given by Woods
         before the 
         <corpname>Virginia State Bar Association</corpname>in 1909
         entitled "The Necessity for General Culture in the Training of
         the Lawyer." Also included in the manuscripts section are two
         short biographical sketches of 
         <persname>Micajah Woods</persname>, a Muster Roll of 
         <corpname>Jackson's Battery of Horse Artillery</corpname>, and
         a ten-page statement dictated by General 
         <persname>John Floyd</persname>detailing the acts of 
         <persname>B. A. Witcher</persname>and his band of followers
         during the Civil War.</p>
      <p>A four-page printed biographical sketch of 
         <persname>Micajah Woods</persname>can be found in the printed
         section along with several programs and memorials. The
         collection also includes nine scrapbooks primarily containing
         newspaper clippings, and dating from 1882 to 1926. One of the
         scrapbooks deals with the trial of ex- 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>mayor 
         <persname>Samuel McCue</persname>for the murder of his wife
         (at which 
         <persname>Micajah Woods</persname>was the prosecuting
         attorney). There is also a small collection of prints and
         memorabilia, principally related to the Civil War.</p>

    <arrangement>
      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>The collection is divided into four series: correspondence,
         manuscripts, printed material, and scrapbooks. The
         correspondence is arranged chronologically and is divided into
         two sections: general correspondence and correspondence
         regarding genealogy. Manuscripts include speeches, diaries,
         biographical sketches, genealogical notes, notes regarding the
         Civil War, and an account book. Manuscripts and printed
         material are arranged alphabetically. A small collection of
         prints and memorabilia appears at the end of the collection. A
         Masonic apron, and cat 30 Civil War medals were removed from
         the collection, and are stored elsewhere in the department.
         (Separation sheets have been filed for these items.) The
         letterbooks of Micajah Woods' law practice can be found in
         accession number 1444 and an additional scrapbook dated
         1895-1902 can be found in accession number 1379.</p>
