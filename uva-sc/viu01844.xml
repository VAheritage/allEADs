      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>George W. Ring is employed by the U.S. Department of
         Transportation as a highway research engineer and has been a
         rhododendron enthusiast and hybridizer since about 1964. He
         has served as the Eastern Chairman of the American
         Rhododendron Society Ratings Committee, the Chairman of the
         Gable Study Group, a Director and past President of the
         Potomac Valley Chapter, and former President of the American
         Rhododendron Society.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent>
      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The papers of 
         <persname>George Ring III</persname>of 
         <geogname>Fairfax, Virginia</geogname>, consist of 2,832 items
         (17 Hollinger boxes, 5.5 linear feet), 1925-1987, chiefly
         correspondence, printed material, working notebooks, and
         questionnaires, all pertaining to his membership in the 
         <corpname>American Rhododendron Society</corpname>and his
         interest in the hybridizers of rhododendrons, both
         contemporary and past.</p>
      <p>Ring's correspondence with other rhododendron enthusiasts
         and members of the 
         <corpname>American Rhododendron Society</corpname>, arranged
         alphabetically by correspondent or topic, constitute the first
         series of his papers and includes such general topics as
         advice about growing rhododendrons, the exchange of plants,
         pollen, seed, and cuttings, orders from nurseries, articles in
         the 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Bulletin</title></bibref>, and requests that he give talks before various
         plant societies. Files on several rhododendron projects are
         also found in this first series.</p>
      <p>The most prominent topic in this collection is the stellar
         contributions of nurseryman and fruit grower 
         <persname>Joseph Benson Gable</persname>(1886-1972) of 
         <geogname>Stewartstown, Pennsylvania</geogname>, in pioneering
         the development of hardy hybrids of rhododendrons, such as
         those found in his own special collection at "Little
         Woods."</p>
      <p>Several files in the first series discuss the efforts of
         the 
         <corpname>Gable Study Group</corpname>, a committee of the 
         <corpname>Potomac Valley Chapter of the American Rhododendron
         Society</corpname>, formed in 1973, whose objective was to
         establish a listing of Gable evergreen azaleas and
         rhododendrons known to be growing in gardens and arboretums.
         Among these are: correspondence of 
         <persname>Caroline Gable</persname>, especially about locating
         old letters between 
         <persname>Guy Nearing</persname>and Gable; 
         <persname>Phil Livingstone</persname>about the Gable chapter
         in 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Hybrids and Hybridizers</title></bibref>; 
         <persname>Orlando Pride</persname>about Gable (November 19,
         1978) and copies of Gable letters (November 28, 1978); 
         <persname>Maletta Yates</persname>about Gable's collaborative
         relationship with her husband, 
         <persname>Henry Yates</persname>; and talks by 
         <persname>George Ring</persname>about the contributions of
         Gable (July 1980 and n.d.). Much of the material pertaining to
         <persname>Joe Gable</persname>is located in the second series,
         which will be described later. The results of the work of the 
         <corpname>Gable Study Group</corpname>was later published as a
         chapter in 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Hybrids and Hybridizers</title></bibref>. 
         <persname>George Ring</persname>was the chairman of the 
         <corpname>Gable Study Group</corpname>.</p>
      <p>Other studies or surveys represented in Ring's papers
         include: 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Hybrids and Hybridizers</title></bibref>in the correspondence of 
         <persname>Phil Livingston</persname>and 
         <persname>Frank West</persname>; the 
         <corpname>Nearing Study Group</corpname>(see also 
         <persname>Emil Bohnel</persname>, September 11, 1980); the
         Rating Project which attempted to rate various rhododendrons
         according to their performance in severe cold and heat
         conditions (Ring was the 
         <corpname>Eastern Chairman of the Rating
         Committee</corpname>); and the "Good Doer" Rhododendron Survey
         of all 
         <corpname>American Rhododendron Society</corpname>chapters.
         This survey resulted in a compilation of rhododendrons and
         azaleas which grow best for each area of the country to be
         included in the national 
         <corpname>American Rhododendron Society</corpname>book of
         "good doers."</p>
      <p>Talks by 
         <persname>George Ring</persname>include: "Value of 
         <emph render="underline">R. Yakusinianum</emph>for
         Hybridizing" (October 24, 1982); "Rhododendrons and Hot
         Weather" (September 1980); "Rhododendron Growers and New
         Instructions" (June 1980); "The Gable Azaleas" (July 1980);
         "Rhododendron Hybridizing" (1979); "Small Rhododendrons and
         Azaleas for Rock Gardens in the Washington, D.C. Area"
         (January 29, 1978); "Species vs Hybrids" (January 14, 1978);
         "Talk for Peg" (April 28, 1977); and "Talk Given at Anna
         Arundel Community College (September 1975).</p>
      <p>Other undated talks include: "Rhododendron Growers and New
         Introductions," "The Best of the East for Western Gardens,"
         "Who is a Hybridizer?, "An Absolutely Up-to-Date Method of
         Growing Rhododendrons and Azaleas from Seed," "Hybrids and
         Species Selected by Joseph Gable," "Culture of Rhododendrons
         and Azaleas," and "Hybridizing and Growing Rhododendrons."</p>
      <p>Other topics include: Ring's correspondence with 
         <geogname>Japan</geogname>ese nurserymen such as 
         <persname>Kenichi Arisumi</persname>, 
         <persname>Koichiro Wada</persname>(see also 
         <persname>Walter Beasley</persname>, December 2, 1982), and 
         <persname>Hideo Suzuki</persname>; the 
         <corpname>International Rhododendron Body</corpname>( 
         <persname>Ralph Sangster</persname>, June 19, 1983); 
         <geogname>Taiwan</geogname>species of rhododendrons (John

         <persname>Orlando Pride</persname>; "hardy" forms of
         rhododendron species ( 
         <persname>Esther Berry</persname>, December 1, 1977); and a
         photograph of 
         <persname>John Wister</persname>, 
         <persname>Frank West</persname>, 
         <persname normal="Raymond Goodrich">Raymond</persname>and 
         <persname>Jane Goodrich</persname>and 
         <persname>George Ring</persname>, 1975 (see 
         <persname>John Wister</persname>).</p>
      <p>The second series contains several notebooks of research
         material pertaining to 
         <persname>Joseph Gable</persname>and his career as a
         hybridizer and other material which formed the basis for two
         chapters in the book, 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Hybrids and Hybridizers</title></bibref>, "Joseph Benson Gable" and "Contemporary
         Hybridizers."</p>
      <p>Several of these notebooks contain copies of old letters
         between Gable and 
         <persname>Guy Nearing</persname>(1890-?), who corresponded
         (ca. 1930-1950) about hybridizing thousands of rhododendrons
         and exchanged ideas and methods, and letters between Gable and
         <persname normal="Henry Yates">Henry</persname>and 
         <persname>Maletta Yates</persname>of 
         <geogname>Frostburg, Maryland</geogname>. Yates collaborated
         with Gable for many years, growing many of Gable's seedlings
         and developing several azalea and rhododendron hybrids from
         them.</p>
      <p>Other notebooks include: one with articles about
         rhododendrons from 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">The National Horticultural Magazine</title></bibref>(1932-1952); four of 
         <persname>Joe Gable</persname>'s own working notebooks
         concerning rhododendrons, including notes of his hybrids
         (1925-1935), a rhododendron bed list (1932), inventory (1936)
         and azalea cuttings (1936); a notebook containing the
         questionnaires sent out to Eastern rhododendron hybridizers in
         order to identify contemporary hybridizers working to develop
         attractive plants hardy for particular areas of the country
         for a chapter in 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Hybrids and Hybridizers</title></bibref>; a working notebook for

         <corpname>Gable Study Group</corpname>Returns used for the
         Gable chapter; and a Gable notebook which contains transcripts
         of the notebooks and file cards kept by Gable and other
         miscellaneous material relevant to the 
         <corpname>Gable Study Group</corpname>.</p>
