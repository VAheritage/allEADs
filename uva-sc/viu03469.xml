      <p>Frank Bane was born in Smithfield, Virginia, April 7, 1893.
         His father was Charles Lee Bane, and his mother Carrie Howard
         (Buckner) Bane. He graduated with an A.B. from Randolph-Macon
         College in 1914 and did graduate work at Columbia University
         in 1914-15. In 1917-18 Bane served as a cadet-pilot with the
         United States Army Air Corps. He married Mary Greyson
         Hoofnagle of Ashland, Virgiia, August 14, 1919. They had two
         children: Mary Clark and Frank.</p>
      <p>Bane assumed the first of a long series of public
         administrative positions when he was appointed secretary of
         the Virginia State Board of Charities and Correction in 1920.
         He was successively Director of Public Welfare in Knoxville,
         Tennessee (1923-26); Commissioner of Public Welfare in
         Virginia (1926-32); and Director of the American Public
         Welfare Association (1932-35). In 1935 he became the first
         Executive Director of the Federal Social Security Board, and
         in 1938 Executive Director of the Council of State Governments
         and Secretary of the Governor's Conference. During World War
         II, Bane served as Director of the Division of State and Local
         Cooperation, Advisory Commission to the Council of National
         Defense (1940-41) and Director of Field Operations, Office of
         Price Administration (1941-42). Following the war Bane resumed
         his post with the Council of State Governments. In 1959
         President Eisenhower appointed Bane first Chairman of the
         Advisory Commission on Inter-Governmental Relations, a
         position he held until he retired in 1966. Among the
         professional organizations to which he belonged were the
         American Science Association, the National Municipal
         Association, the American Association of Social Work, the
         National Institute of Social Sciences and Phi Kappa Sigma.</p>

         #7280 number ca. 5500 items (5.6 shelf feet) for the years
         1919(1936-1966)1971, and consist largely of professional and
         personal correspondence; numerous articles, speeches and
         reports prepared by Mr. Bane; and tax, financial and real
         estate records.</p>
      <p>Among the noteworthy figures with whom Bane corresponded in
         the 1940s and early 1950s are Thomas Dewey, Harry Hopkins,
         Robert Hutchins, Louis Brownlow, Charles Merriam, Harold
         Stassen, and Aubrey Williams. In addition to Bane's
         correspondence and his own writings, the collection includes
         articles by Adlai Stevenson (located in the folder labeled
         "Miscellaneous Materials for Articles and Speeches"), and
         separate folders of speeches and articles by Beardsley Ruml
         and Charles Merriam.</p>
      <p>Included in the correspondence are not only folders for

         conferences, including the American Public Welfare
         Association, the Council on Inter- Governmental Relations, the
         National Committee for Mental Hygiene, the Office of Civilian
         Defense, the Office of Price Administration, and the Social
         Security Board. The latter htree folders are filed under
         "Frank Bane--Personal," as is a folder on the Little Rock,
         Arkansas integration confrontation of 1957.</p>
      <p>Following the series of folders devoted to articles and
         speeches are folders of Bane's poems, stories and favorite
         quotations, and a "confidential estimate of the 1947-48 Fiscal
         Year National Budget." Of specials note among the more recent
         materials are: two history projects in which Bane participated
         as subject, one at the University of California and one at
         Columbia University; his lecture notes and miscellaneous
         materials from his visiting professorship at the University of
         California; a memorial article on Aubrey William; proceedings
         of the Advisory Commission on Inter-Governmental Relations;
         Bane's recommendation concerning restructuring the Commerce
         Department and revamping national transportation policy;
         copies of a one page vita of Bane's life and career, filed
         under "Biography"; photographs; and a 1959 mailing list.</p>

      <p>The original organization of the papers as they were
         received has been preserved. The Bane papers are divided
         sequentially into three rough, overlapping chronological
         periods.</p>
      <p>The first portion of the collection includes an extensive,
         alphabetically arranged correspondence file stretching from
         the mid 1930s through the early 1950s, followed by Frank
         Bane's articles and speeches, 1935 through 1958, in
         chronological order and newspaper clippings, 1939 to 1958, in
         chronological order.</p>
      <p>The second portion of the collection contains, first, Frank
         Bane's personal and professional correspondence, 1953 to 1958,
         in alphabetical order, and second, tax, real estate and income
         records, 1938 to 1958, in chronological order.</p>
      <p>The third portion of the collection is made up of Frank
         Bane's recent correspondence, 1959 to 1966, arranged
         alphabetically, followed by a number of Bane's major studies
         and reports from the 1960s, materials relating to bane's
         visiting professorship at the University of California, and
         other miscellaneous papers.</p>
