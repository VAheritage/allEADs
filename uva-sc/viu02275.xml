      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection contains fourteen letters, notes, and postal
         cards from Ezra Pound to Virginia Moore, one letter from Moore
         to Ezra Pound, and four letters from Dorothy Pound to Virginia
         Moore all written during the time that Pound was a patient in
         St. Elizabeth's in Washington D.C.</p>
      <p>Pound discusses the magazine "Intro," William Butler Yeats,
         Pound's work on Confucius, World War II, and Italian travel.
         Dorothy Pound comments on Moore's book on Yeats and her
         youthful friendship with Georgie Hyde-Lees Yeats. In her
         letter to Pound, Moore disputes Pound's comments on books she
         lent him, his dismissal of modern philosophy, and his
         interpretation of Judaism and Christianity as solely
         legalistic.</p>

            <p>Pound discusses William Butler Yeats and the
                  influence of Giovanni Gentile, Minister of Education
                  under Mussolini, and Benedetto Croce upon his work,
                  "question whether Yeats left any intelligent notes re
                  / Gentile, esp/ that wd/ lead to thesis that Gentile
                  stood for a return to philoSOPHY as distinct from
                  centuries of totally sterile twaddle re
                  philoEPISTEMOLOGY. I know that Y/ thought he was
                  getting somewhere, after bobbling round and reading
                  some Croce etc/ he found Gentile a step forward."
                  Pound also mentions Bergson, Nietzsche, James, Dewey,
                  Hegel, and Winston Churchill and concludes with
                  "apart from a few facts he picked up in Oirish
                  senate, WBY,

                  study, i.e. reading, as distinct from contemplation,
                  during the last 15 years of his life." Also present
                  on the back of the letter is a handwritten note from
                  Dorothy Pound. There is also and enclosed card [Sep?]

            <p>Moore writes concerning two books she had lent
                  Pound who regarded them as of no interest, a Wadler
                  book on linguistics and [William Howard?] Steiner's
                  book on world economics; seeing Omar and Dorothy
                  Pound at Christmas; and takes Pound to task over
                  several sweeping statements about modern philosophy,
                  such as "No good from any ism" (except Confucian 
                  <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">ism</title>!), and about
                  religion "Christianity just follows the legalism of
                  Judaism." Moore follows with a long response, "Well,
                  I can understand why a person should react strongly
                  against the Christian churches. But I can't
                  understand how anyone who has studied throroughly the
                  Old and New Testament (and until he has he hasn't a
                  right to an opinion) can say thay Judaism is solely a
                  legalism. Deuteronomy and tradition, yes. But the Old
                  Testament has two strains, two elements,: the
                  legalistic and 'prophetic,' the latter to be found at
                  its best in parts of Isaiah. It's onto the prophetic
                  part that Christianity- true Christianity, not
                  Christendom- hooks."</p>
