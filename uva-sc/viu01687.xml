      <p>Seabury was born on May 9, 1829 in the state of New York.
         He was a cadet at the United States Military Academy at West
         Point from July 1, 1846 to June 27, 1848. He enlisted with the
         3rd New York Infantry Regiment, Company G, in 1861, at Albany,
         for three years, and was commissioned as a first lieutenant on
         February 19, 1862. He was assigned to the Signal Corps in
         March, 1863 but resigned from the service on January 24, 1864
         in Portsmouth, Virginia. He was later received brevet rank as
         captain of volunteers in March, 1865 for "faithful and
         meritorious service" during the war. Seabury died on August 8,
         1880. 
         <emph render="super">1</emph></p>
      <p>The 3rd New York Infantry was part of the Union Army's VII
         Corps, Department of Virginia, for most of the period covered
         by Seabury's journal. The Corps had been organized on July 22,
         1862 from troops stationed at Fort Monroe, Camp Hamilton,
         Norfolk, Suffolk, Portsmouth, and Yorktown, until August, 1863
         when it was assigned to the Department of Virginia and North
         Carolina.

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection of three items, 1862-1863, consists of a
         bound Civil War signal message journal and two contemporary
         photographs (one a carte-de-visite) of First Lieutenant Thomas
         Shepard Seabury (1829-1880), 3rd New York Infantry. As a
         signal officer Seabury was responsible for communications
         between Union outposts at Norfolk and Deep Creek, Virginia
         [approximately eight miles apart] 
         <emph render="super">1</emph>, from December 12, 1862 to May
         17, 1863. The messages in his journal mention or refer to
         vessels, Confederate troop and guerrilla activities, arrests,
         searches, and passes for civilians, and other related
         subjects. The volume contains approximately forty-nine pages
         with an average of three messages per page. A twenty-three
         page typescript of these dispatches is present with the
         collection.</p>
      <p>While a few of the messages used ciphers in place of names,
         three Union generals are mentioned: John James Peck
         (1821-1878), George Washington Getty (1819-1901), and Egbert
         L. Viele (1825-1902), military governor of Norfolk. Most of
         the 1863 messages are to or from Viele. Major Alexander E.
         Bovay, provost marshal of Norfolk, Major Franklin Asa Stratton
         (?-1879) of the 11th Pennsylvania Cavalry, 
         <emph render="super">2</emph>and Lieutenants R. P. Strong, A.
         M. Thayer, 
         <emph render="super">3</emph>and 
         <persname normal="Theodore">Theo[dore]</persname>F. Patterson,
         who were responsible for stations at Deep Creek, the Elizabeth
         River, and Norfolk, respectively, are among the other
         mentioned officers. A complete list of individuals is appended
         to this guide.</p>
      <p>Various vessels [the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Dollie, Georgeanna, Alice,
         Emily,</title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Arrow</title>] and local civilians are
         also mentioned. The battle of Deserted House [Kelly's Store] 
         <emph render="super">4</emph>near Suffolk on January 30, 1863,
         and a skirmish on April 11, 1863, that proved to be the onset
         of the siege of Suffolk which lasted until May 4, 1863, are
         among the events discussed in the entries. Miscellaneous
         references appertain to: Confederate General Roger Atkinson
         Pryor's (1828-1919) troop movements and those of other
         Confederates [January 16 and April 11, 1863], salt shipments
         [December 12 &amp; 13, 1862], a request for guards for forty
         prisoners [February 13, 1863], complaints by General Viele
         about the "depredations and drunkenness" of Colonel Wardrop's
         troops [January 5 &amp; February 3, 1863], and orders that no
         persons are to be allowed to pass through the lines "without
         being thoroughly searched" [their usual destination being
         Elizabeth City, North Carolina; April 9, 1863]. On a separate
         printed form dated May 3, 1863 there is a message from Major
         Stratton to Generals Viele and Peck regarding the evacuation
         of Sandy Cross, North Carolina, by Confederate forces under
         the command of a General Venner(?). Apparently, the method of
         signalling used by Lt. Seabury's command involved the use of
         either torches or lanterns as foggy conditions were cited as
         having prevented the receipt of messages in the entry for
         April 10, 1863.</p>
