      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Born in Salem, Virginia, Hale moved to Charlottesville with
         his family when he was a teenager. He attended secondary
         school at St. James School in Hagerstown, Maryland, before
         receiving his B.S. degree in Architecture from the University
         of Virginia in 1943. After service in the U.S. Army Air Corps
         and a position with Snead &amp; Company in Orange, Virginia,
         he moved to Charlottesville in 1945, where he became a
         designer in the office of architect Milton L. Grigg. Hale
         designed a number of commercial and residential projects while
         working at the firm between 1945 and 1951, when he left to
         open his own office.</p>
      <p>As a child Hale was artistic and showed an early interest
         in architecture, particularly that of his native Virginia. In
         the late 1930s, while still a teenager, he began his
         architectural career by working summers on the restorations at
         Monticello and Shadwell. This early experience in historic
         preservation set the tone for much of his career. Even as a
         student he seemed to prefer traditional architecture, which
         predicted his later efforts as a restoration architect and
         designer of elegant custom homes in the Colonial Revival
         style. Yet his interest in early Virginia architecture
         extended beyond his professional practice: Among the projects
         left unfinished at his death was a book on the architectural
         history of the Petersburg-Appomattox, Virginia area.</p>
      <p>Hale's promising career ended prematurely when he died
         suddenly on July 19, 1954.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection contains the drawings and business papers
         of Charlottesville architect William Newton Hale, Jr.
         (1920-1954), covering mainly the years 1951 through 1954.
         Hale's architectural practice was varied and ranged from small
         residential projects to large houses and commercial buildings
         in Charlottesville and the surrounding counties. He was a
         registered architect in the states of Virginia and North
         Carolina and a member of the American Institute of
         Architects.</p>
      <p>Today Hale's residential work is probably the best known
         part of his practice, and many of his houses were published in
         William T. Stevens's book, Virginia House Tour (1962). Among
         the larger residential projects preserved in the collection
         are designs for Mr. and Mrs. Russell Alger at Farmington,
         Virginia and Mr. and Mrs. David Smith in Greenwood, Virginia.
         Numerous smaller residential designs include three houses for
         his family at 2022 Hessian Road, 1923 Meadowbrook Road, and 10
         Deer Path Road, and one for his mother at 2029 Hessian Road,
         all in Charlottesville.</p>
      <p>Working with investors Charles Barham and William T.
         Stevens, Hale helped to plan and develop the Bellair community
         west of Charlottesville. He designed seven to nine houses
         there and several more at the nearby Farmington Country Club.
         At the time of his death he was involved with Woodbury Ober in
         development of the Spicer Mill Farm subdivision in Orange
         County, Virginia, where he designed several of the initial
         houses.</p>
      <p>Hale's most important commercial clients were local
         businessmen Charles Barham, M. A. Cushman, J. Deering
         Danielson, Donald G. Stevens, and William T. Stevens. His
         commercial projects include three motel designs: the Gallery
         Courts (now Budget Inn) on Emmet Street at University Avenue
         for Donald Stevens, the Commonwealth Courts on Ivy Road (Rte.
         250) and a design for M. A. Cushman that was never built.
         Commonwealth Courts is now part of the University of
         Virginia's Kluge Children's Rehabilitation Center. Hale also
         designed a restaurant building for J. Deering Danielson that
         was built on Ivy Road only a few yards away from the
         Commonwealth Courts. It is now the University's Police Station
         and Information Center. In downtown Charlottesville he planned
         major alterations and additions to the Old Salvation Army
         building in the 300 block of West Main, a structure that was
         later demolished. Elsewhere, he designed a campus plan for
         Southern College in Petersburg, Virginia, which was not
         built.</p>
      <p>While the drawings and papers come mainly from Hale's
         professional practice, the collection also contains materials
         from his years as an architecture student at the University of
         Virginia and a few samples of his early work. The student work
         is of interest because it shows that while Hale attended the
         University of Virginia in the early 1940s, its architecture
         program experienced a transition from the traditional "Beaux
         Arts" method of instruction based on study of classical
         buildings to one that taught principles of "modern"
         architecture. His student projects include watercolor studies
         of classical architecture, as well as designs for modern
         commercial and residential buildings.</p>
      <p>Hale's talent as an artist was evident not only in his rich
         perspective renderings of designs proposed for clients, but
         also in his large murals at the Thomas Jefferson Inn on Emmet
         Street in Charlottesville (now the Federal Executive
         Institute). The murals, which still grace the walls of the
         Dining Room, depict Jefferson's two most famous works of
         architecture, Monticello and the University of Virginia.</p>
      <p>While Hale's commercial projects were equally divided
         between the traditional and modern styles, his residential
         commissions were almost all traditional. This no doubt
         reflected his own interests as well as that of his clients.
         Most of his house designs fell into two categories: (1) the
         Palladian or Jeffersonian, which were formal, symmetrical, and
         classically detailed; and (2) the Virginia Piedmont
         vernacular, recognizable by their informal, asymmetrical, and
         accretive planning. Later work shows his awareness of popular
         contemporary styles, but even these had a formal quality; he
         rarely designed in such informal residential styles such as
         the ranch house.</p>
