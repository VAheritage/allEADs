      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Gary was born in Tyler, Texas, the son of Franklin Newman
         and Martha Isabella (Boren) Gary, and educated at Bingham
         School, North Carolina, and the University of Virginia. He was
         a captain in the U.S. Volunteers in the Spanish-American War
         and a colonel in the Third Infantry regiment of Texas. In
         1901-1902, Gary served in the Texas House of Representatives
         on the Judiciary and Finance Committees. He was married to
         Bessie Royall (d. 1943) in 1901, at Palestine, Texas, and they
         had two children, Franklin Gary and Helen Gary Moran.</p>
      <p>In 1914, he was made special counsel to the Department of
         State and later became a solicitor there. President Wilson
         appointed Gary a Diplomatic Agent and Consul-General when the
         United States entered the Great War. He served at Cairo, but
         was also in charge of American interests in Palestine, Syria,
         and Arabia, accompanying Lord Allenby at the front beyond
         Jerusalem for awhile in 1918.</p>
      <p>The next year, he was called to Paris for technical work
         with the American Commission to Negotiate Peace. Following
         that work, he was nominated and confirmed as Envoy
         Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Swiss
         Republic until his retirement from diplomatic service in 1921.
         He practiced law in Washington, D.C. and New York City, until
         1934, when he was appointed by President Roosevelt to the
         Federal Communications Commission. In 1938, Gary became a
         solicitor of the U.S. Export-Import Bank.</p>
