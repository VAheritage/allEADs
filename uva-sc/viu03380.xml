        <p>The station logs, some ninety huge volumes, were
            included with the gift materials from the station, but the
            logs have been systematically microfilmed and the originals
            destroyed because of the problem of storage. The station
            management also kindly loaned its collection of historical
            tapes and discs, and those that seemed historically useful
            were copied on tape by the Library for addition to the
            collection. Finally, a number of scrapbooks containing
            newspaper listing of the daily programs of the station, and
            clippings, were discarded as the Library has files of the

      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Radio Station, WRVA, originally owned and operated by Larus
         and Brother Company, Richmond, Virginia, was inaugurated
         November 2, 1925. Broadcasting with a 1,000-watt transmitter,
         WRVA was the highest powered station in Virginia-- a position
         it has continued to occupy. As a civic and community station,
         it obtained program material from all sections of Virginia,
         developing musical talent and originating special events of
         Virginia, developing musical talent and originating special
         events broadcasts in increasing number. The non-commercial
         policy was modified of November 10, 1927, in order to accept a
         popular National Broadcasting Company (NBC) weekly series. On
         January 15, 1929, a 5,000-watt transmitter was placed in
         operation at Mechanicsville, five miles from Richmond, and
         studios in Hotel Richmond were occupied in May, 1933. In 1935
         the first all-wood self-supporting radio tower in America was
         erected to support the WVRA antenna at its Mechanicsville
         site. One June 27, 1937, WRVA became an affiliate of the
         Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), continuing to broadcast
         some Mutual Broadcasting System programs until a full-time MBS
         affiliation was made in Richmond. The station began operating
         on a power of 50,000 watts on March 17, 1939, with its
         transmitter located on the James River ten miles from
         Richmond.</p>
      <p>In 1946 when the owners of WRVA leased the Lyric Theatre, a
         former legitimate playhouse, for the purpose of presenting
         outstanding dramatic and musical attractions currently not
         appearing in Richmond, the theater stage became available for
         broadcasting programs by orchestras, bands, and choral groups
         requiring greater studio space. Broadcasts originating in this
         WRVA Theatre included the Saturday evening "Old Dominion Barn
         Dance" and other special productions presented before
         audiences in the 1,300-seat auditorium half a block from the
         Hotel Richmond studios of WRVA. WRVA's FM affiliates, WRVB
         near Richmond and WRVC in Norfolk, began operation in
         1848.</p>
      <p>WRVA from the time of its inauguration in 1925 was closely
         indentified with Virginia communities and with the civic,
         educational, governmental, cultural and entertainment life of
         the state. Leading talent from these communities broadcase
         from the station's studios, with community leaders speaking in
         regard to the historic, business and cultural aspects of their
         respective areas. Special events were covered by remote
         control from counties and cities in Virginia. Beginning with
         the adressof President Coolidge in Williamsburg in 1926, all
         visits to Virginia by United States Presidents were covered by
         WRVA. The station also handled proceedings incident to the
         inauguration of Virginia governors. From Williamsburg, WRVA
         broadcast numerous special events, including the biennial
         visit of the state legislature for a one-day session in the
         old capitol, occasions on which distinguished visitors are
         honored by the College of William and Mary and, after
         braodcasting from its studios the finals in the Virginia high
         school student competition in the Voice of Democracy Contest,
         the excercise in connection with the visit of the four
         national winners who come to Williamsburg as part of their
         award.</p>
      <p>Other special events include keel-laying and christening of
         major ships of the U.S. Navy at Newport News and Norfolk, and
         such annual features as the Shenandoah Apple Blosson Festival
         in Winchester; National Tobacco Festival in Richmond; Mother's
         Day exercises at the home of the mother of George Washington
         in Fredericksburg; the Institute of Public Affairs at the
         University of Virginia; and anniversaries of the landings of
         the First Permanent English Settlers in America at Cape Henry
         and Jamestown and of the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown.
         WRVA special events included the White Top Mountain Folk Music
         Festival in Southwestern Virginia, Virginia Music Festival in
         Charlottesville, dedication of the restored McLean House at
         Appomattox where the War between the States ended, Richmond
         Bi-Centennial and numerous centennials and special observances
         of counties, cities, churches and colleges throughout
         Virginia. During World War Two, WRVA broadcast frequent
         programs from Camp Pickett, Fort Lee, Fort Eustis, Langley
         Field, Quantico Marine Base, and Norfolk Naval Base, and
         following the war, the ceremonies incident to visits to
         Virginia by General Eisenhower, Admirals Nimitz and Halsey and
         Prime Minister Churchill. WRVA's war correspondent, Jack
         Stone, the only radio correspondent from a Virginia radio
         station, covered the final action in the Phillipines, retaking
         of Manila, occupation of Japan and surrender ceremonies aboard
         the USS Missouri. War effort promotions included the
         sponsoring of deliverty of Savings Bonds to Richmond by Navy
         blimp.</p>
      <p>In cooperation with the Virginia State Chamber of Commerce
         and non-profit Virginia Cruise Corporation, WRVA personnel
         conceived and broadcast a series of programs originating by
         short wave from aboard ships at sea to assist in promoting
         Virginia ports' importance to national and world commerce.</p>
      <p>After covering all political campaigns, WRVA provided a
         complete news service for Primary and General Election returns
         with statements of winning and losing candidates from their
         homes or at studios. The public was invited to visit WRVA
         Election Night Headquarters in the studio newsroom or at the
         WRVA Theatre where an elaborate listing of returns could be
         seen on the stage. The congressman from the Third District, in
         which Richmond is located, has for several years broadcast
         regular weekly reports while Congress is in session.</p>
      <p>One of the oldest radio programs of continuous existence in
         the nation is the Virginia Department of Agriculture Market
         Reports. Inaugurated in November, 1925, this 5-day-a-week
         program originates in the offices of the Division of Markets
         where the latest market news and quotations are available.
         Early morning farm programs brought to teh WRVA microphones
         the Virginia Commissioner of Agriculture and other authorities
         on matters of agricultural interest. Special agricultural
         events broadcast by WRVA include exercises at Hopewell
         incident to the corn-production-per-acre contest and Soil
         Conservation demonstrations in Mecklenburg and Charlotte
         counties.</p>
      <p>WRVA, since it was inaugurated with a prayer of dedication,
         has been closely identified with the religious interests of
         Virginia. The station's 25th anniversary was opened with an
         inter-faith observance in Richmond's largest auditorium with
         ministerial leaders and choirs of Protestant, Jewish, and
         Catholic affiliation participating in a program in which the
         WRVA facilities were rededicated to the religious life of the
         community. On this occasion, leading chruchmen offered
         voluntary tribute to the station's quarter of a century of
         service to Virginia churches. WRVA has continued to enjoy the
         cooperation of ministerial associations, the Virginia Council
         of Churches, and other religious organizations.</p>
      <p>WRVA for a number of years broadcast the Easter Sunrise
         service at the State Capitol grounds in Richmond under
         auspices of the Richmond Federation of Christian Young People;
         the Thanksgiving Day service from historic Leigh Street
         Baptist Church; a Christmas Eve Protestant service; and, the
         midnight Pontifical Mass from Sacred Heart Cathedral with the
         Bishop of the Richmond Catholic Diocese as celebrant. WRVA
         broadcast features in connection with religious events such as
         church dedications and conventions.</p>
      <p>Educational programs produced and presented by WRVA
         included the Schools and Cross-roads forum under PTA auspices
         with educators, parents, and business and civic leaders
         participating, and the annual University of Richmond
         Scholarship Quiz in which high school students in Virginia
         counties and cities participated in comprehensive examinations
         in the classrooms and before WRVA microphones in various
         school auditoriums with winners receiving scholarships to the
         University of Richmond.</p>
      <p>In 1968, Larus and Brother Company reorganized and became
         the Larus Investing Company. In July 1968, WRVA AM and FM
         became, respectively, WRVA Radio, Inc. and WRVA-FM Radio,
         Inc., subsidiary corporations of the Larus Investing Company.
         Larus Investing Company sold its entire WRVA stock in November
         1969 to Southern Broadcasting Company of Winston, Salem, North
         Carolina. Harte-Hanks Newspapers, Inc., purchased Southern
         Broadcasting Company, including WRVA-AM and WRVA-FM in August
         1977. Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc., sold the radio
         stations to Edens Broadcasting Company, a company formed by
         the senior managers of Harte-Hanks Radio, Inc., a subsidiary
         of Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. in December 1984.</p>
      <p>WRVA was sold to Force II Communication, L.P., of San Diego
         in September 1991, and in the spring of 1992, Clear Channel
         Communications bought WRVA and is the current owner.</p>

    <scopecontent>
      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of 114 boxes of papers, tape
         recordings of broadcasts, scrapbooks, printed materials,
         1925-1968, etc., (ca. 50 shelf feet) from the files of
         Richmond Radio Station WRVA, Virginia's only 50,000 watt clear
         channel AM radio station.</p>
      <p>A large segment of the collection is devoted to the files
         of Walter R. Bishop. These files, created by the station's
         public relations manager, begin in the first month of
         broadcasting and continue until Bishop's death in 1963. They
         demonstrate the influence which his work had over station
         policy. Bishop was a religious and conservative man with great
         gifts of energy and friendliness. His correspondence with many
         state and national figures in broadcasting, politics, the
         church, and business, is all present, as is much material on
         Bishop's private life, civic activities, church, work,
         etc.</p>
      <p>Soon after his arrival at the station, the manager made
         Bishop WRVA's "roving ambassador of goodwill," and ordered him
         to join every organization in sight, and to publicize their
         activities over WRVA. He plunged enthusiastically into his
         work, and became a leader in many of the organizations which
         he joined. Soon the connections became so close that Bishop's
         life became very nearly a barometer of Richmond's civic life
         and activity.</p>
      <p>The great strength of the collection is its detailed
         documentation of the services of civic awareness, inspiration,
         and solidarity a radio station can provide for its community.
         WRVA's pre-eminent status among Richmond stations--for some
         time it had the highest average rating in the nation--and its
         unswerving devotion to these same public-spirited ideals make
         it a perfect object of studyfor the researcher seeking
         examples of the realization of certain aspects of radio's
         potential as a mass medium.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, some of the station's files were destroyed
         when the station moved from its old quarters in the Hotel
         Richmond to its new office and studio building at 22nd and
         Grace Streets. Thus, there is practically no material on the
         relationship between the station and Larus and Brother, its
         original owners, for instance.</p>
      <p>Other materials, such as much of the historical files of
         the first years of the station, were borrowed from Mr. Calvin
         T. Lucy, the first station manager, and microfilmed (See
         accession no. 9040-a) by the University of Virginia
         Library.</p>
      <p>WRVA broadcast church services and speeches of local civic
         leaders, politicians, and educators to a far greater extent
         than strictly necessary to evidence a perfunctory concern with
         such matters. From the earliest times WRVA proved its desire
         to create a strong civic awareness in Richmond. Its success as
         a station and the widespread acceptance of many of the
         station's ideals show how pervasive has been its
         influence.</p>

         1939-1961. Very valuable materials on station expenses and
         dealings with the Federal Communications Commission. There are
         several budgets, office memos, and data on sale of air time to
         political candidates and agencies. How this was alloted may be
         of special interest. In Box 39 there is material on the
         stations' business in the first year of its existence, and in
         box 40, several journals and ledgers. 
         <lb/><emph render="bold">Box 40:</emph>WRVA Advertising History.
         Data on a few special aspects of WRVA's advertising in the

         <lb/>Boxes 41-42: Scientific, Personnel Material. Data on the
         growth of WRVA's physical plant, demonstrating how often it
         had proven necessary to discard old ideas, machines, and even
         station locations. Other information on personnel and
         personnel policies is in box 43.</p>

         1955-1963. Material used on a folksy-chat type of radio
         program treating Virginia politics, the state of the nation,
         etc., and which presents perhaps the best opportunity to delve
         into Bishop's mind to see how his ideas interacted with the

                  station. Invited community groups from Va., Md., and
                  N.C. to perform. Went commerical about 2 1/2 years
                  later because cost of operating was high as hours
