      <p>Thomas Lafayette Rosser was born on October 15, 1836, on
         his father's farm in Campbell County, Va., the eldest son of
         John and Martha Melvina (Johnson) Rosser. The family moved to
         the Sabine River region of Texas when Thomas was thirteen. In
         1856 he entered West Point, where George A. Custer became an
         intimate friend.</p>
      <p>With the outbreak of the Civil War, Rosser resigned from
         West Point, and entered the Confederate army as a first
         lieutenant in the Washington Artillery. Rosser was severely
         wounded in May, 1862. Upon his recovery, General Stuart gave
         him command of the 5th Virginia Regiment. In May 1863 he also
         took command of the legendary Laurel Brigade. Among the major
         engagements in which General Rosser participated were
         Catlett's Station, First and Second Manassas, South Mountain,
         Buckland Mills, Trevilians, Woodstock, and Five Forks.</p>
      <p>On May 28, 1863, he married Betty Barbara Winston of
         Hanover Courthouse. After the war he struggled for several
         years to support his family, before taking a position in 1871
         with the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad and in 1872
         with the Northern Pacific Railroad. He soon became chief
         engineer of the latter and superintended construction of its
         tracks west to Livingston, Montana. From 1881 to 1886 he was
         chief engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railroad. He then
         purchased the "Rugby" property near Charlottesville and
         settled down as a gentleman farmer. In 1898 he commanded a
         brigade of American volunteers at Chickananga during the
         Spanish-American war. In 1905 Rosser was appointed postmaster
         of Charlottesville. He died March 29, 1910, and was survived
         by his wife, his son Thomas, Jr., and two daughters, Elise and
         Marguerite.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This addition to the papers of the Gordon and Rosser
         families contains ca. 300 items 1764(1834-1910)1969, largely
         consisting of correspondence. The earlier portion of this
         correspondence includes primarily letters addressed to
         Elizabeth Gordon from her sister, Lucy, and her sister-in-law,
         Elizabeth Lindsay Gordon, 1816-1857. The Gordon family later
         came to be related to the Rossers through Elizabeth Lindsay
         Gordon's granddaughter, Harriet Hart Gordon, who married
         Thomas Rosser, Jr. The second portion of the correspondence
         contains Rosser family correspondence, largely that of Thomas
         Lafayette Rosser and Thomas L. Rosser, Jr., 1862-1931.
         Rounding out the collection are several wills, including that
         of Barbara Winston (the great-grandmother of Mrs. Elizabeth
         Winston Rosser) and Thomas L. Rosser; other legal agreements;
         some eulogies and memorials; several essays; a small number of
         receipts and financial papers, 1863-1934; surveys; stories and
         poems.</p>
      <p>The pre-Civil War correspondence between the Gordon
         sisters, who lived in Central Virginia on their respective
         estates at Germanna, Lindsay Stone and Edgeworth, is not
         particularly extensive (some 60 items), but provides an
         interesting portrait of early nineteenth century domestic
         life. Elizabeth Lindsay Gordon's letters to her sister-in-law
         Elizabeth describe not only family affairs but her home
         manufacturing activities as well. Among the important figures
         mentioned in Thomas L. Rosser's Civil War correspondence with
         his fiancée and wife Elizabeth Winston (Rosser) are
         Confederate Generals R.E. Lee, J.E.B. Stuart, H.B. McClellan
         and Early. Interspersed among the personal letters of 1862,
         1863, and 1864 are secret military orders sent to Rosser,
         mainly from J.E.B. Stuart. Rosser's own letters to his wife
         contain not only descriptions of troop movements, preparations
         for battle and glimpses of "the enemy" in Central Virginia and
         the Shenandoah Valley, but also recurrent discussions of the
         possibilities for promotion, denials in mid-1863 of rumors
         that Rosser had earlier been married to another woman, and
         promises to his wife that he will give up the vice of
         drinking.</p>
      <p>Most of the post-Civil War correspondence, particularly the
         correspondence of Thomas Rosser, Jr., is devoted to personal
         matters and the activities of family and friends in Virginia
         and in Minneapolis. Among the imortant figures General Thomas
         L. Rosser corresponded with are Theodore Roosevelt (1900) and
         Virginia Senator John W. Daniel (1898). Of particular interest
         are an 1890 letter to Thomas, Jr., form George Gordon Battle
         describing how to acquire financing for investing in Minnesota
         coal lands, and two 1899 letters to Rosser, Sr., from a "Mr.
         Fitzlee" in Cuba, describing land speculation
         possibilities.</p>

      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The Rosser collection has been organized according to the
         type of manuscripts it contains. First, the collection
         contains the correspondence, which has been organized
         chronologically. Letters relating to the Gordon family occupy
         folders for the years 1816-1857, and the Rosser correspondence
         begins in 1862. Following the correspondence are legal and
         financial documents (also organized chronologically), and
         these are in turn followed by essays, surveys, newspaper
         clippings and miscellaneous papers.</p>
