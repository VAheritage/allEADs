      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Educator, diplomat and banker, 
          Frederick Earnest Nolting, Jr. was born
         August 24, 1911 in Richmond, Virginia to Frederick Earnest
         Nolting, Sr. and Mary Buford Nolting. Known as "Fritz," he
         spent his early childhood and student years in Richmond
         attending the St. Christopher's School. Later as an
         undergraduate he attended the 
          University of Virginia in Charlottesville
         where he earned a B.A. degree in history and went on to work
         as an investment banker in the family business in Richmond for
         the next five years.</p>
      <p>In 1939, Nolting returned to graduate studies at the
         University of Virginia, earning an M. A. (1940) and a
         Ph.D.(1942) in philosophy and serving as a lecturing fellow in
         that field. He also earned a second M.A. in philosophy at
         Harvard in 1941. During World War II, Nolting served overseas
         in the Navy, achieving the rank of Lieutenant Commander. In
         1946, he left the Navy and began a career that would span 18
         years with the Department of State. His service included
         assignments as a member of the U.S. Delegation to the United
         Nations (1951); as Special Assistant to Secretaries of State
         Dean Acheson and John Foster Dulles for Mutual Security
         Affairs (1953-1955) and as Alternate U.S. Representative to
         the North Atlantic Council (NATO) in Paris (1955-1961). In
         1961, President Kennedy named Nolting as Ambassador to the
         Republic of South Vietnam where he served until 1963 in what
         was to be a period of shifting U.S.Vietnamese policy
         developments that precipitated the overthrow and assassination
         of President Ngo Dinh Diem.</p>
      <p>In 1964, Nolting retired from the U.S. Government to become
         Vice-President in charge of the European offices of the 
          Morgan Guaranty Trust Company in Paris
         (1964-1969), then Assistant to the Chairman in New York City
         (1969-1973) and, finally, as consultant to the company
         (1973-1976).</p>
      <p>During this time, Nolting had returned to the University of
         Virginia to serve as Diplomat-in-Residence (1971-1973) before
         going on to hold teaching and administrative posts as Olsson
         Professor of Business Administration in the Darden School of
         Business (1973-1976), Professor in the Woodrow Wilson
         Department of Government and Foreign Affairs and Director of
         the Miller Center of Public Affairs. He also served as
         Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the 
          Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation and
         as a member of the 
          Center for Advanced Studies and the 
          International Management and Development
         Institute.</p>
      <p>In 1982, Nolting retired from the University of Virginia
         and devoted a good deal of his time to the writing of his
         book, <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">From trust to tragedy : the political memoirs of Frederick Nolting, Kennedy's ambassador to Diem's Vietnam,</title> which he published in 1988. The book serves as
         Nolting's personal testament to his role as U.S. Ambassador in
         Saigon and as a critical analysis of the conflicting political
         strategies that existed among the many policy making players
         during that volatile period of the U.S. involvement in
         Vietnam.</p>
      <p>On December 14, 1989, at age 78, Nolting died and was
         survived by his wife, 
          Olivia Lindsay Crumpler whom he had
         married in 1940 and who is presently residing in
         Charlottesville and by their four daughters: 
          Mary Nolting Bruner and 
          Jane Nolting Meniktos both of
         Charlottesville; 
          Grace Lindsay Nolting of Columbia,
         Virginia and 
          Frances Temple of Geneva, New York.</p>
