      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Morrison &amp; Skinner Family Papers consist of 76
         items from the period 1861 - 1955, with the bulk of the
         material falling between 1879-1894. The collection consists of
         correspondence, genealogical material, legal papers,
         photographs, printed material, and stock certificates.</p>
      <p>These papers focus primarily on the settlement and
         distribution of David H. Morrison's estate upon his death in
         1882 among his wife, Harriet Skinner Morrison and six
         children: Charles Carrol Morrison, James H.S. Morrison, Julius
         Curtis Morrison, Sarah Eliza Morrison Holland, Harriet Gest
         Morrison Rankin, and Samuel R. Morrison. His estate consisted
         of both his personal property and the assets of his company,
         The Columbia Bridge Works. David H. Morrison, a surveyor and
         engineer in Dayton, Ohio, built many of the bridges in that
         area and held two patents in the area of bridge building.</p>
      <p>The correspondence includes two letters from J. Charles
         Morrison to his sister Harriet M. Rankin concerning their
         father's estate and three letters of recommendation for
         William T. Rankin for a position in the legal department of
         the Pullman Palace Car Company in Chicago.</p>
      <p>The genealogical material consists of two typewritten
         copies of a family history by Thomas Morrison, father of David
         H. Morrison. This includes early family history as well as the
         life and travels of Thomas Morrison, with special emphasis
         given to his time in Dayton, Ohio. Also included are David H.
         Morrison's typewritten death announcement which provides
         details of his life's work; a genealogy of the Morrison family
         from 1660 to the 1860's; two typewritten histories of the
         origin of the Morrison family name; and a typewritten
         biographical sketch of Harriet Skinner Morrison's father and
         grandfather.</p>
      <p>Legal papers comprise the bulk of the collection and
         include mostly deeds and agreements, but also leases,
         mortgages, receipts, insurance policies and David H.
         Morrison's will and accompanying codicil. The majority of the
         deeds and agreements involve the transfer of property, money,
         business ownership and stock between Harriet S. Morrison and
         her six children after the death of her husband in 1882. For a
         more detailed account of the individual legal documents, see
         the handwritten list in the control folder.</p>
      <p>Included in this collection are two unidentified
         photographs; one photograph of Louise Rankin Bloom (Mrs. John
         McLeod Bloom) ca. 1900; and one photograph of a gathering of
         people in riding habits on the front steps of Clover Hill,
         with people partially identified.</p>
      <p>Printed material in the collection consists of 3 printed
         copies of "The Story of the Huguenot's Sword" (1929),
         reprinted from 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Harper's Monthly Magazine</title>(1851
         April) and several newpaper clippings, including death
         announcements for David H. Morrison (1882 July 22), Harriet
         Skinner Morrison (1898 Nov 27) and Loren Curtis Diver; a
         clipping for the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Los Angeles Times</title>regarding the
         last name Morrison; and a clipping from 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Nation Tribune: Washington,
         D.C.</title>Other items of interest include stock certificates
         from The Columbia Bridge Company to J. C. Morrison (1884
         April) and from the Silver Islet Mining and Milling Company to
         W. T. Rankin ( 1892 April).</p>
