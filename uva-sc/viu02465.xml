            <p>The Holsinger Studio Collection was placed in the
            Special Collections Department of the University of
            Virginia Library in 1973-1974 through a grant from the
            University's Rotunda Restoration Committee, whose primary
            interest was to locate negatives that would aid the
            reconstruction of the Rotunda.The collection was purchased
            in 1978 through generous contributions made by the
            University of Virginia Alumni Association and an anonymous
            donor.</p>

         <p>Rufus W. Holsinger came to Charlottesville from
         Pennsylvania by way of Manassas in the late 1880's, to
         establish a photographic business. His "University Studio" at
         719-721 West Main soon became the leading studio in town, with
         a reputation for first-quality work. Holsinger himself served
         at various times as president and treasurer of the
         Photographic Association of Virginia and the Carolinas, and as
         treasurer of the Photographer's Association of America. He was
         a long-time member of the Charlottesville City Council,
         president of the Chamber of Commerce, and an organizer and
         director of the National Bank of Charlottesville. After his
         death in 1930, the studio was owned and operated by his son,
         Ralph W. Holsinger, Jr., who moved the studio in 1935 to 908
         West Main. Upon the Ralph Holsinger's retirement in 1969, the
         studio passed from the hands of the Holsinger family, and the
         business ceased operation in 1977.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The Holsinger Studio Collection constitutes a unique
         photographic record of life in Charlottesville and Albemarle
         County, Virginia, from before the turn of the century through
         World War I. The collection consists of approximately 8,900
         dry-plate glass negatives and ledgers from the commercial
         studio of Rufus W. Holsinger. Approximately two-thirds of the
         collection are studio portraits, and among these are nearly
         500 portraits of African-American citizens of Charlottesville
         and the surrounding area. Many of the portraits are
         unidentified, but some are of visiting celebrities and
         dignitaries. In 1915 while teaching art at the University of
         Virginia, Georgia O'Keeffe sat for a portrait with Mr.
         Holsinger.</p>
         <p>The collection also include scenes and events from the
         community and from the University of Virginia. Perhaps the
         best-known views are those of the University Rotunda before,
         during, and after its burning in 1895, but many other events
         are depicted, including parades, fires, exhibitions, and train
         wrecks. Prints made fresh from the original negatives are
         models of clarity and detail. They give new life to times long
         past. A studio fire in 1912 destroyed the early business
         ledgers and some negatives. Those negatives surviving the fire
         range in size from 5x7 to 14x17 inches.</p>
