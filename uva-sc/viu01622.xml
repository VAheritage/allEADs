         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Soapstone Shortlines Alberene Stone and
         Its Railroads,</title>1990, by Garth G. Groff, which is a
         history of the local Nelson and Albemarle Railway Company and
         the soapstone companies that owned it.</p>
      <p>The Nelson and Albemarle Railway Company was incorporated
         on September 14, 1903, in Virginia, and on June 19, 1905, the
         company absorbed the Schuyler Railway. The Company ran a main
         line from Esmont to Rockfish via Schuyler. They also took over
         operation of the Chesapeake and Ohio's branch, (Warren to
         Alberene via Esmont) built in 1897-1898 as the Alberene
         Railroad, to provide service to the valuable soapstone
         quarries in the area.</p>
      <p>According to 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Poor's Manual of
         Railroads</title>(1910) the Company operated the following
         lines: Guthrie to Schuyler (6.87 miles); Gutherie to Esmont
         (.32 miles); and Schuyler Dam to Rockfish (3.61 miles); they
         operated under contract with the Cheasapeake and Ohio Railroad
         the line from Alberene to Esmont (4.98 miles); and had
         trackage rights from the Southern Railway from Dam # 1 to
         Rockfish (.55 miles) and from the Virginia Soapstone Company's
         Schuyler Yard (.49 miles). The Company primarily carried
         freight but it also had a few passenger cars.</p>

         and sidings (1905 Aug 29); scheduling changes (1907 Jan 7

         Jan 14 &amp; 21, and Mar 30); accidents on the railroad (1907
         Jan 8; 1910 Jun 1 &amp; 17); a possible agreement with the
         Southern Railway Company to a joint agency at Rockfish (1907
         Jan 11, 25, &amp; 29); a claim against the Electric
         Construction Company of Virginia (1907 Apr 1 and Sep 9); an
         incident between the Conductor [C.C. ?] Critzer and William
         Gay, the brakeman for the Southern Railway Company (1907 May
         17); the need for a workman's train for the Virginia Soapstone
         Companies and the cost of running such a train (1907 Sep 24;
         1910 May 27; and 1911 Sep 29); the cost of an engine repair
         (1910 Mar 19); claims against the company for damage caused by
         fire (1910 Mar 26, Apr 7, 8, &amp; 14, Jun 1, and Aug 17; and
         1911 Feb 7); derailments (1910 Jun 17 &amp; 22; and Dec 8; and
