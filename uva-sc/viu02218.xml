         <p>This collection consists of fifty-five letters, ca.
         1927-1986, chiefly from Mary (Mealand) Stone Naijon
         (1890-1984), Paris, France, to her life-long friend, Fillmore
         Norfleet. Mary Naijon was an American born in Cleveland, Ohio,
         who first married Walter [Stone ?] in the United States. After
         a divorce, she moved to Paris, France in 1924, where she
         taught school to young children. In 1934, she married Andre
         Naijon (d. 1974) and became totally a Frenchwoman, never
         returning to the United States in her later years. Also
         present is a fourteen page typed round robin letter by Mrs.
         Naijon with autograph emendations describing her experiences
         in France during World War II including her internment at
         Vittel, France, by the Germans.</p>
         <p>Topics in her letters to the Norfleets include: a
         description of her culinary and visual experiences on her trip
         to Rouen, France (1927 Oct 29); her encouragement to Fillmore
         to continue his writing and her advice concerning love and
         marriage based on her own early life with Walter [Stone ?]
         (1928 Jan 21); a reference to her round robin letter about
         World War II and her internment at Vittel, sent after her
         liberation reaching them years later (1948 Feb [21 ?]);
         comments about Frances P. Keyes' book Came A Cavalier and her
         thanks for Fillmore's book on St. Memin (1948 May 17);
         political upheaval in France, a lack of things to purchase at
         the market, and shortages in electricity (1949 Dec 16); the
         grim food situation in England and the need for any used
         clothing in France (1951 May 17); the arrival of two of her
         brothers in Europe, Dick in London, and Arthur (1891 ?- ) in
         Paris (1951 Sep 25); and the sale of several of her children's
         songs to Silver Burdett and Ginn &amp; Company.</p>
         <p>Additional topics include: the illness of her brother Dick
         ([1905 ?]-1958) with cancer, his return to Lyme, Connecticut,
         and subsequent death (1957 Nov 29; 1958 Apr 2); the unfair
         criticism of Paris by American visitors (1958 Jul 4); her
         serious illness from September 20 until the date of the letter
         (1967 Jan 27); the death of Andre Naijon (1974 Oct 5); a
         political bombing in the building across from hers in Paris,
         changes in Parisian architecture and the increase in crimes by
         teen-agers in France (1976 Jan 1; Dec 20); more about changes
         in Parisian architecture and neighborhoods (1977 Oct 12); her
         dislike of Julien Green and comments by the French who resent
         his entry into the Academie Francaise (1978 Jan 13; 1984 Jan
         13); mention of the Naijon mustard industry in Dijon (1978 Mar
         15); the worsening of crime in France with Mary a victim of
         attacks and robberies (1978 May 8; 1982 Jan 18); her disgust
         with Francois Mitterrand and French politics (1982 Apr 8); and
         her distrust of Ronald Reagan (1981 Jul 25; 1984 Jan 1).</p>
         <p>Other letters in the collection include a letter from Mary
         Naijon's niece Ruth Mealand Swartz to Elizabeth Norfleet about
         the death of Mary Naijon (1986 Aug 24) and a letter from
         [Madame ?] Lapeyroux, Poitiers, concerning the bad conditions
         in France after World War II (1947 Sep 17). Another letter
         from [Madame Lapeyroux ?], Poitiers, assures the Norfleets
         that they will be happy to have them visit during their tour
         of Europe, mentions the Norfleets' visit to Greece during the
         trouble with Turkey, and promises that Pierre will write them
         (1974 Jul 31).</p>
