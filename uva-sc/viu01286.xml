            the Virginia Credit Union League, Lynchburg, Virginia,
            through William Wilkerson, Assistant Provost for Research,

      <p>This collection consists of ca. 16,000 items, 1923-1991,
         and contains correspondence, printed material, minutes, and
         related materials, much of which was formerly housed in
         three-ring notebooks (probably by the League Historian and
         Editor of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Virginian</title>, Jack O'Connor),
         all pertaining to the history and operations of the Virginia
         Credit Union League. The Virginia Credit Union League was
         organized on November 26, 1934, and became incorporated in
         1952.</p>
      <p>The League was founded "to promote the organization and
         development of credit unions in Virginia, to represent the
         credit unions on a state and national basis, to originate
         favorable legislation and to guard against attacks on present
         laws, to provide advice and counsel in the development of
         local credit union chapters, to maintain a state-wide
         publication for the dissemination of information for credit
         union operations, and to maintain a central source for the
         dissemination of information about applicable governmental
         laws and regulations."</p>
      <p>The collection is arranged in two series, 1) Minutes and
         Credit Union League History Papers and 2) Miscellaneous
         Topical Files re the Virginia Credit Union League. The first
         series, 1953-1991, arranged in reverse chronological order
         within the year, comprises the material found in three-ring
         binders and consists of the minutes of the Board of Directors
         meetings, the Executive Committee meetings, Education
         Committee meetings, other occasional committee meetings, and
         the Annual Conventions, including minutes of the Virginia
         League Central Credit Union; notices and bulletins; reports of
         various committees; treasurer's reports and financial
         summaries; printed material; statements concerning policies
         and objectives; reports of the managing director; issues of
         the official publication for the V.C.U.L., 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Virginian</title>; correspondence;
         copies of addresses and speeches; memoranda; agendas for
         meetings; nominations; rosters of Virginia Credit Union
         officers; notes concerning the V.C.U.L. meetings kept by Jack
         O'Connor; and credit union memorabilia.</p>
      <p>Many of these records in the first series were assembled to
         help compile an updated history of the Virginia Credit Union
         League. In about 1968, Jack O'Connor, a member of the League
         Education Committee for a total of twenty years, was appointed
         League Historian. O'Connor wrote several long-time activists
         in the credit union, such as Managing Director Eugene H.
         Farley, Jr., Dollie Reynolds (a League Director), C.L.
         Shackelford (League President 1952-1953, President of the
         Danville Chapter, and former editor of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Virginian</title>), and E.L. Field
         (League President 1936-1937), asking for their help in
         assembling earlier League records into a new history to
         supplement E.L. Field's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Credit Union League History
         1922-1954</title>(see Box 29). O'Connor was a very active
         volunteer in the Virginia Credit Union League, Editor of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Virginian</title>, President of the
         Tidewater Chapter of the Credit Union, a founding father and
         the only President of the St. Pius X Federal Credit Union
         until his death in 1979. O'Connor's history was never
         published in book form but appeared in monthly historical
         segments in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Virginian</title>.</p>
      <p>The second series consists of miscellaneous topical files
         pertaining to the V.C.U.L. (Boxes 22-32). Among these are the
         correspondence and records kept by E.L. Field (Boxes 24-26),
         1923-1966, arranged in chronological order, dating from
         Field's (d. 1973) election as president of the Richmond Postal
         Credit Union, the first successful credit union in Virginia,
         on September 7, 1923. These records are used frequently for
         the earliest years covered in the latest history of the
         Virginia Credit Union League, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Of the People, By the People, and For

         the Local Service Council; the establishment of credit unions
         in Petersburg, Norfolk, Roanoke, and elsewhere; the use of the

         (1879-1955), the executive secretary of the Credit Union
