      <p>This collection pertains to the Venable, Minor, Wilson and
         related families. Included are correspondence, papers,
         photographs, artwork, memorabilia, and bound volumes. The
         majority of the collection consists of letters addressed to
         Anne C. J. Minor, daughter of Natalie Embra (Venable) and
         Raleigh Colston Minor, and wife of Walter O. Klingman. There
         are also letters to other members of the Venable and Minor
         families.</p>
      <p>There are several letters addressed to Charles Scott
         Venable (1827-1900) and Raleigh Colston Minor (1869-1923)
         among the correspondence of the Venable and Minor families.
         There are two letters, July 21, 1875 and October 24, 1895,
         from 
         <persname normal="Thomas">T[homas]</persname><persname normal="Francis">F[rancis]</persname>Bayard
         (1828-1898) to Charles 
         <persname normal="Scott">S[cott]</persname>Venable. In 1875,
         he mentions Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem "Morituri
         Salutamus"; discusses national politics and finances; and,
         comments that "men of conscience and convictions" have always
         had problems of adaptation. In 1895, from the Embassy of the
         United States in London, he mentions [ ] Price receiving the
         Waterloo medal and Lord [Welseley] being the new commander-in-
         chief; comments on the Venezuelan matter (the boundary dispute
         between Venezuela and Great Britain) and the journalists'
         coverage which seems to create sensation; comments on 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Life of General Thomas
         Pinckney</title>by his grandson (Rev. Charles Cotesworth
         Pinckney) and that "it is a pity the South does not take care
         of the history of it's men... On February 7, 1896, 
         <persname normal="Walter">W[alter]</persname><persname normal="Heron">H[eron]</persname>Taylor (1838-1916)
         writes to Charles 
         <persname normal="Scott">S[cott]</persname>Venable, commenting
         on [James] Longstreet (1821-1904) and his book [ 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">From Manassas to Appomattox; Memoirs of
         the Civil War in America</title>]. On April 11, 1918, Charles
         Henderson writes from Camp Lee, Virginia, to Raleigh 
         <persname normal="Colston">C[olston]</persname>Minor, while
         serving in the 320th Regiment in its Headquarters Company. He
         describes his duties while at the Depot Brigade and the
         organization of each regiment's Headquarters Company; relates
         news that he will probably be assigned to the Signal Platoon;
         writes that he saw "William" and other friends at O. S. C.
         where there was little work; and, comments that "Easter Week
         makes me fear for the sanity of the present student body" [at
         the University of Virginia] and that there seems to be a lack
         of steadying influences.</p>
      <p>There are letters, 1915-1927, to Anne C. J. Minor from
         various family members and friends. On November 7, 1915,
         [Robert Kent] Gooch (1893- ) writes from Christ Church,
         Oxford, commenting on the great variety of people riding
         bicycles and the beauty of the colleges and describing some of
         the war scenery in France. On February 24, 1917, Edmund Minor
         Wilson (1895-1972) of the 111th Field Artillery mentions the
         parade with twenty-eight thousand men; comments on Anne
         Minor's education, being a bridesmaid, and corresponding with
         French soldiers; and, writes about activities which include
         having inspections and grooming horses. Raleigh Colston Minor
         at the University of Virginia writes his daughter on June 15,
         1918, with news of [C.] Venable [Minor], Thomas Barringer,
         Arthur [Barksdale] Kinsolving, and Isabel Perkinson. There are
         postcards, September-December 1918, from French and American
         soldiers, including 
         <persname normal="Armistead">A[rmistead]</persname><persname normal="Mason">M[ason]</persname>Dobie (1881- ). A
         March 27, 1919 letter from "Minor," Camp Meade, Baltimore,
         finds him back from France and expecting to be discharged. It
         also mentions needing volunteers for the victory loan and news
         of Charles Henderson. On May 9, 1924, Thomas Manning writes
         from the Columbia Country Club, Chevy Chase, Maryland, a
         humorous letter mentioning the orchestra playing a tune "Will
         Spearmint Keep Its Flavor on the Bedpost Overnight?" There are
         two letters, June 7 and December 18, 1925, and a postcard from
         Port-au-Prince, Haiti discussing the weather, activities and
         daily life in Haiti, native Haitians, and its being
         undeveloped. There are postcards, June-July 1925, from Italy
         and France, mentioning cabarets and other shows, including 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Rose Marie</title>. A June 7, 1927
         letter from Milton C. Elliott concerns the Law Class of 1902
         presenting the University of Virginia with a portrait of her
         father, Raleigh Colston Minor.</p>
      <p>There are also letters, 1928-1931, to Anne C. J. Minor from
         family and friends. Letters from July 1928 are from "Harrison"
         and "Billy" on an overseas voyage and visit to various places
         in Europe, apparently with a group of University of Virginia
         students. Persons mentioned on the trip include: 'Mike'
         [Morton Morris] Pinckney, 'Sunny' [Russell Lee] Post, Jouett
         [Ross] Todd (1903-1967), "Harry" [Henry Kennedy] Benham,
         'Andy' Anderson, "Bill" [William Hamilton] Roper, "Jim" [James
         Miller] McCready, "Tom" Winston, "Jack" [John Samuel]
         Poindexter, Howard [Weaver] McCall, Jr., and Garrison Elder.
         These letters discuss activities and plans on the voyage,
         seeing the play 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Bachelor Father</title>in New York,
         plans to see John Stewart Bryan (1871-1944) in London,
         activities and travel in Switzerland, living quarters and
         inhabitants in Hotel Malherbe, travel around England's
         Devonshire, London, and Shakespeare country, and activities in
         Paris, France. There is also a postcard, Sep 1928, from
         Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia. There are also letters, May 30
         and August 19, 1929, from "Janie" in Paris, France, relating
         plans for an exploration trip to Heidelburg and Cologne,
         Germany, Brussell, Belgium, and the coast of Normany, France;
         discussing activities and a typical school day in Toul, France
         and future travel plans; and, commenting on 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">All's Quiet on the Western
         Front</title>and "the utter futility of war." There are also
         postcards, late 1920s, from Canada, Mexico, London, and Costa
         Rica. A letter, ca. July 1928, from "Ted" [Edmund George]
         Laird from Paris, France, discusses travel activities in Great
         Britain, the beach of Dinard, Notre Dame, the Louvre, and St.
         Denis, France.</p>
      <p>There are several letters, 1918-1919, to Anne C. J. Minor
         from Fred A. Broomall of the 6th U. S. Engineers stationed in
         France and Germany. While in France, May 1918 - November 1918,
         Broomall mentions being with the British Expeditionary Forces
         but attached to the Australian Imperial Force and later with
         the American troops, the official status of the unit at the
         University of Virginia, Thomas Smedley Butler of the Marines,
         the war developing into one of movement instead of one of
         position, and harvest season in France with crops worked
         mostly by French soldiers and peasant women. Broomall also
         discusses fighting with the infantry, the regiment's capture
         of prisoners and important ground, the armistice being signed,
         going forward again but with no shells or machine guns,
         expecting to be part of the Army of Occupation, and the
         feelings of the allies. During February 1920, Broomall is
         assigned to Ochtendung, German with the Army of Occupation,
         where he writes concerning activities in the Claire Chesnes in
         the Argonne Meuse region, action near Malancourt (Esnes), and
         his progress in the war since December 20, 1917. The
         activities of the U. S. Engineers include erecting barracks at
         Haute Sa&amp;#56442;&amp;#56684; building steel bridges,
         destroying the big Engineer dump at Chaulnes, building bridges
         over the Somne Canal, joining the 3rd Division or the Marne
         Division, bridging the Vesle River at Tismes, taking over the
         road from Montzeville to Malancourt, relieving the 79th
         Division, crossing into Luxemburg, and reaching the area near
         Coblenz. Current activities include athletics and military
         competitions such as horse shows and rifle teams, and being in
         charge of the regimental mounted section. In May 1919,
         Broomall is still in Germany on detached service and writes
         that they took over some road work from the 318th Engineers,
         6th Division. He comments on returning soldiers to the United
         States and the parades of welcome and the 6th U. S. Engineers
         wishing to take their colors up Pennsylvania Avenue as a D. C.
         regiment. He also describes the scenery of mountains,
         vineyards, gardens and potato fields, and the daily life of
         German children.</p>
      <p>Among the letters, 1940-1946, to Anne C. J. (Minor) and
         Walter O. Klingman are several from her brother, C. Venable
         Minor. A November 8, 1940 letter and its attachments concerns
         a legal matter involving an African-American, Robert Ellis, in
         the employ of the Klingmans in New York. On January 21, 1943,
         Minor writes a verbose and witty letter concerning his trip to
         Washington, D. C. to procure a position in the service and the
         obstacles encountered. He describes at length his contact with
         various officers in different branches of the service and
         other officials, including 
         <persname normal="Edward">Ed[ward]</persname>[R.] Stettinius
         (1900- 1949), [T. Munford] "Munny" Boyd, and [James] Hardy
         Dillard, and, visits to the Judge Advocate General's Office,
         the Pentagon Building, Lend- Lease, the Marine Recruiting
         Office, and Selective Service Headquarters. He also mentions
         teaching Virginia Procedure and Contracts in the University of
         Virginia Law School and the arrival of [Mary] "Polly"
         [Southall Venable] Barclay Dulaney [Mrs. Robert Leroy
         Dulaney]. On May 3, 1943, Minor discusses the Aircraft Warning
         Services, Mrs. Dulaney, 'Radar' in the Marine Corps, his
         difficulty in being commissioned into service, and his
         position with the archaic office known as Examiner of Records.
         A June 24, 1943 letter from Minor expresses concern for their
         ailing mother, [Natalie Embra (Venable) Minor] and requests
         that all of her children and grandchildren attend her birthday
         celebration on July the 15th; discusses further obstacles with
         being commissioned into service; and, mentions servants Annie,
         Blondie, and Isaiah. A letter, December 1, 1944, from Dr.
         Charles Scott Venable, San Antonio, Texas, to Walter O.
         Klingman, requests that he give serious consideration to
         moving to San Antonio following his release from service in
         order to assist the only neuropsychiatrist at the medical
         center. A July 28, 1945 letter from Charles E. Thompson
         concerns swords sent from Belgium and France. On September 12,
         1945, Minor writes a brotherly letter expressing his affection
         following an apparent misunderstanding in which he also
         mentions the death of Murray [Mason] McGuire (1872-1845) and
         news of his wife Clara [Winston Cabell] McGuire, and news of
         the release of "Staige" and Walter [Klingman] from the Army. A
         letter dated December 21 from Julius Barclay in London
         includes information on the illustrated book Coaching Days of
         England.</p>
      <p>Letters, ca. 1870s, to Mary L. Minor from Nannie C. Minor,
         chiefly relate to personal and family matters and various
         cloths or materials for making garments and also mention cases
         of the measles among the children, the death of young "Cooke,"
         Lizzie Maury, Bertha Rives, and Jeannie Colston.</p>

         Elizabeth McDowell Benton (1794-1854), Elizabeth (Henry)
         Russell (1749-1825), and the Venable, Wilson, Minor and
         related families. The material for educational institutions
         include: catalogue (1896) for Hampden-Sidney, a poem (1921) by
         Moncure Lyne, "The Centennial of the University of Virginia,"
         flyer (1925) for a celebration of the Episcopal High School of
         Virginia, and an anonymous card from the Seven Society with
         its symbol. Among the medal and memorabilia are an IMP charm,
         a Republican National Convention medal and ribbon (1904), and
         a medal for the dedication of the Stonewall Jackson statue
         (1891). The miscellaneous material includes a sketch on John
         S. Skinner's visit to Albemarle in 1820, auctions (1988) for
         "Midmont" and Michie Tavern, postcards for the Edgar Allan Poe
