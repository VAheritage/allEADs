        <p>This collection was given to the Library by Julius

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>There are 11 items, 1846-1918, pertaining to the Minor and
         Venable families of Charlottesville, Virginia. There is a
         diary, August - November 1918, of medical service in France
         during World War I, kept by Charles Scott Venable (1877-1961).
         Other items include correspondence and an obituary of Emily C.
         Stras, letters to Florence C. Southall and Charles Scott
         Venable (1827-1900), and photographs of Sir Robert Montgomery
         and Lady Lucy Montgomery Denison.</p>
      <p>In his diary, Venable makes references to the care and
         treatment of the wounded at the hospitals and the conditions
         of those hospitals in France where he is serving. During
         August 15-18, he writes about hospital conditions, the arrival
         of a convoy of patients, and the care of patients. On
         September 17, he writes that the hospital is filling rapidly
         with wounded soldiers and about his success with the Dakin
         treatment and closures and other medical procedures. On
         September 26, he writes that the hospital is reaching capacity
         and comments on the memorandum about consulting with the chief
         of orthopaedic service. On September 29, he mentions that the
         hospital received 117 patients, all African-Americans. That
         same date, he also writes that the inefficiency of the
         commanding officer has contributed to the withdrawal of all
         help and support by the Red Cross and that they must now rely
         on the Army for supplies. On October 15, he mentions that
         there are numerous fractures on hand and that he has started
         an outpatient clinic with [Kyle Bear ?] Steele in charge. On
         November 14, many of the patients have been evacuated; and, on
         November 19, the hospital is down to about 2,000 patients.</p>
      <p>In the diary, Venable also refers to University of Virginia
         alumni and friends on several occasions: Stuart McGuire
         (1867-1948) and Green Baughman on August 9; Lewis Dabney
         Crenshaw (1884-1947) on August 11; Davis B. Wills, Daniel
         Warwick Harmon, "Dutch" [Leartus Jerauld] Owen, Hugh Hampton
         Young (1870-1945), Henry M. Sackett, Seale Harris (1870-1957),
         Beverley Randolph Tucker (1874-1945), Charles Patton Echols
         (1867-1940), E. Algernon Coleman (1876-1939), and Charles J.
         Kinsolving at a "Virginia soirée" on August 11;
         [Leartus Jerauld] Owen, Daniel Warwick Harmon, and General
         [Jefferson Randolph] Kean (1860-1950) in Toul on September 2;
         Lomax Gwathmey ordered to Charmois on September 10; the
         suicide of Paul Lee Cocke, the fourth of his friends to take
         that route, on September 26; Richard Lloyd Cook and Walter
         Francis Scott at a meeting of the Allied Medical Council at
         the Continental October 4-5; Daniel Warwick Harmon, James
         Douglas Fife, Davis B. Wills, Hugh Hampton Young, Walter
         Francis Scott, and Richard Lloyd Cook at a Virginia alumni
         soirée" on October 5; Lomax Gwathmey brought in
         with a leg wound obtained while he was with Evacuation
         Hospital 4 at Fromerville near Verdun and his being Gwathmey's
         replacement at the hospital on November 6 and 8.</p>
      <p>Other entries in the diary concern personal matters and
         news of the war. On August 11, he travels to Montdidier from
         Paris, and describes travel across the advance trenches, the
         Oise River, road conditions, troops of Algerians, Moroccans,
         and French, evidence of fighting at Gournay, the desolation at
         Tricot, and the desolation in Montdidier. On September 20, he
         writes that he was selected as inspector of the district and
         had been confided in by Col. [ ] Cabell that he had been
         ordered to select and train an officer as C. O. and that he
         wanted Venable to do it. He also mentions that he went to the
         Embassy and to the Crillon to call on Thomas Nelson Page
         (1853-1922). On October 29, he mentions that he was
         recommended for a promotion and transfer. He writes news of
         the allied countries being in conference in Versailles on
         October 31, a brief description of the celebration in Paris
         the previous week on November 1, news from Paris that "the
         Kaiser has abdicated" on November 9, and "the Armistice is
         signed and while peace is not yet the war is over" on November
         11. On that day, he also describes the scene when the bells
         began to ring and the joyous scene in Paris with citizens and
         soldiers celebrating. On November 17, he writes that he
         attended the Parade of Alsace with its good flying but rotten
         parade.</p>
      <p>There is also correspondence contained in the collection.
         There are three letters, 1946-1947, to Florence C. Southall
         from "Rose Hill," Richmond, and "Frescati," Gordonsville,
         Virginia, chiefly concerning family and local news. Topics
         discussed are William [Southall], the wedding of Douglass
         Meriwether of Albemarle to Miss Gardner of Richmond, a party
         at James Heath given to Virginia Macon, Charlottesville and
         Staunton friends, and the temperance lectures of [John
         Bartholomew] Gough (1817-1886). There is a letter, February
         11, 1877, from J. (Justus) Scheibert (1831-1903) in Prussia,
         to Charles Scott Venable (1827-1900), discussing work on his
         book on the Franco-Prussian War and a future translation into
         English and the wife of 
         <persname normal="Walter">W[alter]</persname><persname normal="Husted">H[usted]</persname>Stevens
         (1827-1867) wanting to translate from the French version. On
         November 26, 1882, Scheibert writes from Hirschberg, Silesia,
         Prussia, concerning U. S. politics, mentioning Southern
         sympathizers for the new party, Virginia elections,
         Republicans, Democrats, anti-temperance men, and temperance.
         He comments that "revolution of any time has struggled for the
         differences of Southern and Northern political views..." and
         poses several questions concerning the political atmosphere in
         the United States and the Republican and Democratic parties.
         There is a transcript of a letter, June 7, 1879, from James
         Longstreet (1821-1904) to Venable along with Venable's
         recollections concerning the Battle of the Wilderness on May
         5-6, 1864.</p>
