</head>
      <p>This collection consists of 4 letters of Beach Hill to Stephen Barlow. Hill describes his life since he left Connecticut, his decision to go to sea, current work on a James River and Chesapeake Bay shipping vessel, the "indolent" lives of the lower classes in Virginia, the control of Virginia mercantile business by foreigners, political frenzy at election time, and inferiority of Virginia lawyers. He enquires after his friend and the fate of the Federalist party. The small pox epidemic in Savannah and the mob scene at election time there are brief topics.

          <p>Remains ignorant of all that has passed in Connecticut since he left, describes his feelings when they parted in New York, his subsequent decision to go to sea on a Virginia vessel out of Philadelphia, his new career as a seaman, currently in charge of a [crafting?] vessel whose owner lives on the banks of the James River and with whom he stays when not on the vessel. He then goes on in detail about the inferior habits and customs of both the high and low classes of Virginia, sharing his observations about the latter Virginians, "But the lower classes of both sexes are mere objects of pity, they are taught nothing, they possess nothing, they have seen nothing, they know nothing and they aspire to nothing--too indolent to labor and too [stupid?] to live without it. They live in mere huts and will content themselves to feed upon Indian cake and [dried?] herring." He also states that all the mercantile business in Virginia is run by foreigners. Hill then reflects back pleasurably on his days at the Weston Academy, [Fairfield County, Connecticut?], and all his childhood friends.

          <p>Celebrates his good fortune at renewing their friendship; asks if Barlow has married, sharing his own lack of success; he has spent the past winter sailing only upon this river [the James?] and the Chesapeake; asks how Federalism is faring at home, stating that the people in Virginia are in a political frenzy; and attends the courts in Virginia whose practice is more formal than the [North's?] but whose lawyers are (of course!) generally inferior.
