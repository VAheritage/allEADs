      <p>This collection consists of twenty-one letters and
         postcards, January through June, 1941, from Atcheson Laughlin
         Hench (1891-1974), Charlottesville, Virginia, to his mother,
         Mrs. Jacob Bixler Hench (1865- 1944) nee Clara John Showalter,
         in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, concerning family, local, and
         University of Virginia news. Family members frequently
         mentioned in the letters include Hench's wife, Virginia
         Bedinger Michie (1897-1971), and his two daughters, Clare and
         Margaret.</p>
      <p>Specific topics in this correspondence include: a
         description of a meeting of the Modern Language Association,
         his impressions of Dumas Malone and his wife, and a speech by
         Franklin Delano Roosevelt (January 3); his talk given to the
         Waynesboro Women's Club concerning "Our American Vocabulary"
         at St. John's Parish House (January 9); the drive at the
         University of Virginia to buy two mobile canteens to feed the
         civilians in Great Britain who had undergone intense bombing
         raids (January 17); the English luncheon day at Farmington
         with its topic of whether the requirements for the Master's
         Degree were too stringent and the Albemarle Historical Society
         meeting in the Minor Hall Theatre featuring music known or
         played by Thomas Jefferson (January 24); Virginia's
         involvement in radio broadcasts for a local drive for "Bundles
         for Britain" (February 8); the Hospital League charity party
         concerning the history of the popular song held at the Clemons
         home (February 19); and a talk by Madame Butterfield
         concerning her experiences with the German invasion of France,
         especially witnessing the practice landing from barges of the
         German soldiers in Brittany when hundreds of Germans drowned
         due to the treacherous currents of the coast (April 1).</p>
