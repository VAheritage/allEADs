         <p>
            <persname normal="Louis I. Jaffe">Louis I. Jaff&eacute;</persname> was born in Detroit, Michigan, February 22, 1888, the son of Phillip and Lotta Maria (Kahn) Jaff&eacute;. When Jaff&eacute; was twelve years
old, his family moved to Durham, North Carolina, and he graduated from high school there in 1907. In 1911, he received an A.B. degree from Trinity College (now Duke University).
</p>
         <p>While a student at Trinity, Jaff&eacute; edited <title render="italic">The Chronicle,</title> a campus weekly, and was associate editor of <title render="italic">The Archive,</title> a college monthly. After
graduation, he joined the staff of the Durham <title render="italic">Sun,</title> but left a short time later to become a reporter and assistant city editor for the Richmond <title render="italic">Times-
Dispatch</title>.
</p>
         <p>In 1917, Jaff&eacute; was commissioned as Second Lieutenant in the Field Artillery Section, Officer's Reserve Corps of the United States Army. He was re-commissioned in the Aviation Section 1918, and again in
1919 with the Service of Supply. He was honorably discharged in France, March 29, 1919, and was commissioned as Inspector in the American National Red Cross with rank of Captain. He served on the Red Cross
Commission to the Balkans from April to July, 1919, and was director of the Red Cross News Service in Paris from July to October, 1919. He was made a Chevalier of the State of Roumania, and honor bestowed in
recognition of his work there with the Red Cross Commission.
</p>
         <p>After the war, Jaff&eacute; went to Norfolk to become editor of the <title render="italic">Virginian-Pilot,</title> a position he held from 1919 until his death in 1950. He was prominent among Virginia liberal
journalists and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1929 for an editorial deploring a lynching which took place in Houston, Texas, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention.
</p>
         <p>In one of his last editorials, dated February 25, 1950, concerning the "mercy killing" of the Boothe bill for desegregation of Virginia public transportation he wrote: "The Virginia Democratic organization
makes haste slowly in the field of social-political reform...It is still too uneasy about the impact of de-segregation on common carries to give the proposal anything like an official blessing. That will come
later-after a longer look at this highly desirable reform, and possibly after another shove or two from the Supreme Court of the United States."
