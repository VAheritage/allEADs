      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The 
         <famname>White family</famname>papers contain 1,190 items (4
         Hollinger boxes, ca. 1.5 linear feet), 1794-1921, chiefly the
         correspondence, business and legal papers of the 
         <famname>White</famname>and 
         <famname>Robertson</famname>families of 
         <geogname>Abingdon, Virginia</geogname>. These closely related
         families were two of the leading participants in the business
         and political life of Southwest 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>during the nineteenth century.
         The business papers of Col. 
         <persname>James White</persname>(1770-1838), other papers
         concerning the settlement of his estate, and the business and
         correspondence of the 
         <famname>White family</famname>, chiefly of 
         <persname>William Young Conn White</persname>(1812-1882), all
         contain material relating to the development of business and
         industry in Southwest 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>and its economic ties to 
         <geogname>Tennessee</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Alabama</geogname>before and after the Civil
         War.</p>
      <p>The first two series of the 
         <famname>White family</famname>papers contain Col. 
         <persname>James White</persname>'s own business papers,
         1807-1838, and papers relating to the settlement of his vast
         estate, 1838-1878. Col. White was involved in a number of
         mercantile interests (up to some forty-five at one time) in
         addition to the saltworks at 
         <geogname>Saltville, Washington County</geogname>. This
         included business interests in the states of 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Tennessee</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Alabama</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Georgia</geogname>, and investments in lead mines in
         <geogname>Wythe County</geogname>, iron furnaces, cotton
         plantations, and slaves. His property was worth at least
         $750,000 at the time of his death. Unfortunately, Col. White's
         business papers do not furnish a complete picture of any of
         these interests.</p>
      <p>Col. White moved to 
         <geogname>Abingdon, Virginia</geogname>about 1795. Prior to
         his arrival there, White had worked for 
         <corpname>Talbot, Jones &amp; Company</corpname>, a 
         <geogname>Baltimore</geogname>merchandising house, who
         supplied him with enough goods to set up his own business. He
         married Miss 
         <persname>Eliza Wilson</persname>in 1798 and began expanding
         his business by becoming a partner of such men as Mr.
         Henderson in 
         <geogname>Abingdon</geogname>and 
         <persname>William Lynn</persname>in 
         <geogname>Alabama</geogname>.</p>
      <p>One of his most important business enterprises was the
         leasing of the saltworks at 
         <geogname>Saltville, Virginia</geogname>, from the executors
         of the 
         <persname>William King</persname>estate. Because the chain of
         ownership and control of the saltworks is somewhat confusing,
         the following short history of ownership will clarify White's
         own involvement in the property.</p>
      <p>General 
         <persname>Francis Preston</persname>and his family had owned
         the salt lick when 
         <persname>William King</persname>(1769-1808) purchased the
         land west of their claim in 1795. By 1799, King had erected
         furnaces and began the manufacture of salt. He also rented the
         <corpname>Preston Salines</corpname>until his death in 1808.
         According to his will, the salt works were carried on by his
         brother, 
         <persname>James King</persname>, 
         <persname>William Trigg</persname>, and 
         <persname>William King</persname>'s wife, 
         <persname>Mary Trigg King</persname>, and their executors
         until 1819, when it was leased to 
         <persname>John Sanders</persname>. Sanders sold his lease
         rights to 
         <persname>James White</persname>who leased the operations
         until 1833. Other individuals leased this property until the
         formation of the 
         <corpname>Holston Salt &amp; Plaster Company</corpname>in
         1864. The 
         <corpname>King Saltworks</corpname>produced from 90,000 to
         100,000 bushels of salt per year. During the Civil War, it was
         the largest supplier of salt to the Confederacy.</p>
      <p>The business papers of Col. White contain several items
         related to his salt interests including: papers concerning the
         estate of 
         <persname>William King</persname>and the saltworks (October
         27, 1820; May 14, 1821; April 3, June 7, &amp; October 4,
         1823; and September 1834); extracts from 
         <persname>John Hardies</persname>' disposition concerning salt
         prices, 1824-1829 (April 7, 1829); and other legal papers
         regarding the saltworks (May 26, 1830; September 8, 1831;
         April 1833; November 7, 1834; March 12 &amp; September 27,
         1836; May 26, 1837; and August 15, 1838); a valuation of
         buildings at 
         <geogname>Saltville</geogname>(undated) and a memorandum
         regarding the account books at 
         <geogname>Saltville</geogname>(undated).</p>
      <p>His business papers also include the balances on the 
         <geogname>Saltville</geogname>books (1820-1835). Papers
         concerning cotton shipments (1837-1838) and his other
         mercantile interests (August 25, 1821 and April 16, 1835) are
         present but do not adequately represent the extent of his
         involvement.</p>
      <p>The settlement of the estate of Col. 
         <persname>James White</persname>was not completed until 1878
         and the records in the second series show the extent of
         White's assets at his death, especially the slave and land
         inventories (ca. 1838), a notebook regarding the estate of 
         <persname>James White</persname>, 1843-1863, and a commonplace
         book record of the division of his property (ca. 1851).</p>
      <p>An inventory entitled "Inventory and appraisement of the
         personal property belonging to the estate of Col. James White
         deceased" is an especially useful summation of Col. White's
         economic status at the time of his death. It contains entries
         for: merchandise (pp. 1-18); small notes (pp. 19-37); salt due
         bills (p. 38); appraisements of property in 
         <geogname>Clay County, Kentucky</geogname>, and the 
         <corpname>Limestone</corpname>and 
         <corpname>Bellefonte</corpname>Plantations in 
         <geogname>Alabama</geogname>(pp. 39-44); sales of personal
         property (pp. 45-46); dividends, cash received and notes (p.
         47); various agreements (pp. 60-121); and settlement of the
         estate (pp. 126-129). The volume also has notes regarding the
         periodic examination of the accounts by the commissioner which
         were recorded by the court, 1839-1871.</p>
      <p>The correspondence of the 
         <famname>White family</famname>includes many letters
         concerning business matters; of special note are the letters
         of 
         <persname>Thomas Wilson White</persname>(1817-? ) to his
         brother 
         <persname>William Young Conn White</persname>(1812-1882), both
         sons of Col. 
         <persname>James White</persname>. 
         <persname>Thomas White</persname>was the manager of the
         family's plantation " 
         <corpname>Bellefonte</corpname>, " near 
         <geogname>Huntsville, Alabama</geogname>, and his letters give
         a detailed account of its affairs (Feb., Nov., and Dec. 1843;
         Jan. 1844; Sep., Nov., and Dec. 1845; Feb., Apr., and Dec.
         1846; Jun. 1847; Jul. 1848; Mar. and May 1849; Mar. and Jul.
         1851; Feb.-Apr. 1852; Apr. 1854; Oct. 1857; Jan., Apr., &amp;
         Jun. 1858; Jul., &amp; Sep.-Oct. 1859; Nov. 1862; Jul. 1874;
         Mar., Apr., and Dec. 1876; Feb. and Jun. 1877; and Mar.
         1878).</p>
      <p>Other topics of interest in the 
         <famname>White family</famname>correspondence include: slavery
         (January 1, 1840; August 26, 1841; April 25 &amp; November 29,
         1846; January 23, 1858 and July 16, 1859); the salt
         merchandising business (November 28, 1842), banking and
         financial difficulties (February 9, 1843; June 1, 1847; and
         October 13, &amp; 16, 1857); and cotton prices (January 21,
         1844; November 23, 1845; February 28, 1846; and April 29,
         1854).</p>
      <p>The fourth group of papers include the legal,
         miscellaneous, and business papers of the 
         <famname>White family</famname>. Of note in the legal papers
         are the following: an inventory and appraisement of the
         estates of 
         <persname>Eliza White</persname>and 
         <persname>Eleanor W. White</persname>(1851-1880); an indenture
         regarding the saltworks between 
         <persname>James White</persname>and 
         <persname>William King</persname>(August 4, 1823); and land
         grants signed by various governors of 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>, including 
         <persname>James Pleasants</persname>, 
         <persname>James Wood</persname>, and 
         <persname>John Tyler, Sr.</persname></p>
      <p>Miscellaneous papers include a copy of a talk concerning
         Judge 
         <persname>Peter Johnson</persname>(1763-1831) who grew up at "
         <corpname>Longwood</corpname>" near 
         <geogname>Farmville, Virginia</geogname>(undated) and a copy
         of The Daily Express of 
         <geogname>Petersburg, Virginia</geogname>(April 18, 1864).</p>
      <p>The business papers of the 
         <famname>White family</famname>show their widespread business
         interests, especially those of the 
         <geogname>Saltville</geogname>saltworks and their lead mines
         in 
         <geogname>Wythe County, Virginia</geogname>. The account of
         Dr. 
         <persname>Alexander Preston</persname>with 
         <persname>Eliza White</persname>(December 1839), containing
         fees for medicines and doctor visits, sheds light on the types
         of treatment occurring on a large plantation with many slaves.
         A list of articles bought at a sale (August 22- 26, 1842)
         includes livestock and slave prices.</p>
      <p>Several of these papers deal with the 
         <famname>White family</famname>'s continued interest in the 
         <corpname>King Saltworks</corpname>, which later became the 
         <corpname>Holston Salt and Plaster Company</corpname>(Dec.,
         1855; Sep., 1862; Jan., 1866; Apr., 1872; Sep., 1874; Jun.,
         and Oct., 1875; Feb., and May 1876; and Apr., 1877). There is
         also other material concerning the 
         <corpname>Holston Salt and Plaster Company</corpname>in the
         years, 1872-1881.</p>
      <p>A large amount of material in the business papers concerns
         the lead mines in 
         <geogname>Wythe County</geogname>under the company names of 
         <corpname>Austinville Lead Mining Company</corpname>, 
         <corpname>Union Lead Mines Company</corpname>, and 
         <corpname>Wythe Lead and Zinc Mine Company</corpname>(Feb. and
         May 1856; Nov. 1857; Nov. 1864; Nov. 1865; Jul. and Dec. 1866;
         Mar., May, Jul.-Dec. 1874; Jan. 1875; Dec. 1876; and Jan.-Apr.
         1877). The bulk of the material on the lead mines is located
         within the years 1874-1880.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains a small group of papers
         concerning the 
         <famname>Campell family</famname>, 1853-1882. One letter,
         August 23, 1862, describes some of the economic difficulties
         resulting from the Civil War.</p>
      <p>The next series consists of the 
         <famname>Robertson family</famname>papers. 
         <persname>James Lowry White</persname>(1842-1914), son of 
         <persname>William Young Conn White</persname>, married 
         <persname>Catherine Markham Robertson</persname>, daughter of
         Governor 
         <persname>Wyndham Robertson</persname>(1803-1883), who resided
         at the " 
         <corpname>Meadows</corpname>, " near 
         <geogname>Abingdon, Virginia</geogname>.</p>
      <p>The papers of 
         <persname>Powhatan Robertson</persname>, a brother of 
         <persname>Wyndham Robertson</persname>, include: reports on
         his college work (1815-1816) and essays written by him at 
         <corpname>William and Mary</corpname>(undated); three small
         travel diaries describing his European Tour through 
         <geogname>France</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Italy</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Switzerland</geogname>(October 12-November 25, 1818,
         November 26-December 22, 1818, and January 3-May 2, 1819); and
         letters describing the government and people of 
         <geogname>Switzerland</geogname>and predicting that the growth
         of Russian power and influence would continue into the next
         century (June 9, 1819), and a speech by 
         <persname>John Randolph</persname>during the Missouri
         Compromise debate (February 22, 1820).</p>
      <p>The correspondence of the 
         <famname>Robertson family</famname>contains several Civil War
         letters of interest: 
         <persname>Frank Robertson</persname>'s description of Major 
         <persname>John Pelham</persname>(1838-1863) who fell at 
         <geogname>Kelly's Ford</geogname>(March 19, 1863); bands of
         men pillaging the country (April 1865); and reconstruction
         politics and settlement (June 6, 1865).</p>
      <p>The letters to 
         <persname>Kate (Robertson) White</persname>contain several
         Civil War letters from her brother Frank, who served as a
         captain under 
         <persname>J. E. B. Stuart</persname>, about his life as an
         officer and skirmishes ( [ca. 1860 ?]; August 25, 1861; May 7,
         July 26, and August 3, 1862; April 5 &amp; 18, 1863; and an
         attempt by Federal forces to capture the saltworks at 
         <geogname>Abingdon</geogname>(October 17, [1864]). There are
         also many letters from 
         <persname>Wyndham Robertson</persname>and 
         <persname>Mary Frances Trigg Robertson</persname>to their
         children, especially Kate.</p>
