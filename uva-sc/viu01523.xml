      <p>This collection consists of four Civil War letters,
         1864-1865, from New York soldiers and a U. S. Christian
         Commission agent pertaining to personal, camp, and war-related
         events. Also present is a fragment from a Confederate warship,
         the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Drewry</title>.</p>
      <p>Two letters were written by B. H. Hibbard of the U. S.
         Christian Commission, stationed at City Point, Virginia. The
         first (on Commission stationery), August 1, 1864, describes
         for "Brother George" his typical daily duties at the base
         hospital--dispensing food, clothing, religious reading
         material; promoting morale; and conducting meetings and
         services for the troops. 
         <emph render="super">1</emph>On August 10, Hibbard describes
         the grisly aftermath of the Confederate sabotage explosion at
         City Point (April 9): "I Saw the most appalling sight I ever
         witnessed. Men stretched on the Ground dead and dying . . .
         and such screeching such agony and writhing . . . arms and
         legs and head and bodys of men . . . there was barely room to
         set your foot without stepping on something that had been
         thrown up the explosion." 
         <emph render="super">2</emph></p>
      <p>John H. Francis, camp of the 7th New York Independent
         Battery [7th Battery, New York Light Artillery], 24th Army
         Corps, during the siege of Petersburg writes on February 2,
         1865 to "Friend George" that he has been detailed as a clerk
         for three months. He describes his quarters (a log house) and
         his company. An attack by Confederate vessels led to the
         destruction of the rebel ram (gunboat and tender) "Drury" [CSS
         Drewry; destroyed on the James River by Union artillery,
         January 24, 1865]; 
         <emph render="super">3</emph>Francis encloses a three-inch
         fragment (tied with red, white and blue ribbons). He recalls
         his visit to Baltimore three years previously and
         characterizes it as "a very fair city but the girls can't hold
         a candle-stick to the Brooklyn maidens, who in my opinion are
         No. 1, and can't be beat in any respect"; he also mentions the
         24th regiment's (a New York infantry or militia regiment)
         selection of an armory site back home, an organization
         identified as "The Brotherhood of State Street," and being
         under fire at "Butler's Canal" [Dutch Gap Canal].</p>
      <p>Another soldier, George F. Morse (perhaps the same "George"
         to whom the previous letters were addressed?), writes from
         Petersburg on April 11, 1865 to his father regarding his good
         opinion of the U. S. Christian Commission (this letter is on
         Commission stationery). He also claims that Confederate
         General Robert E. Lee has arrived in the city as a prisoner of
         war but he has not yet seen him. [Morse was mistaken. Lee was
         never held as a prisoner nor did he return to Petersburg after
         its April 2 evacuation. He remained in the Appomattox Court
         House area until April 12 before returning to his Richmond
         residence.] Morse informs his father that he is sending a note
         with a delegate of the U. S. Christian Commission 
         <emph render="super">4</emph>who plans to visit Brooklyn and
         concludes that with the surrender of the Army of Northern
         Virginia "Everyone thinks the war is about over, the Rebs
         themselves say there is no use of fighting anymore."</p>
      <p><emph render="super">1</emph>The U. S. Christian Commission,
         under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A., provided spiritual
         guidance, distributed Bibles, newspapers and magazines,
         conducted wholesome diversions to relieve the boredom of camp
         life, sent soldiers' money home for their families and
         otherwise promoted the social, religious and psychological
         welfare of Union soldiers. The Commission had a large
         headquarters facility at City Point. Andrew Boyd Cross,
