</head>
      <p>Frederic Gershom Melcher (1879-1963) was born in Malden, Massachusetts, and died on March 9, 1963, only a short while after his friend, Robert Frost. Melcher's influence in the world of books was notable, having worked as a publisher and editor for more than a half century; a bookseller at Charles E. Lauriat Company of Boston and W.K. Stewart Company, Indianapolis, Indiana (1913-1918), for almost a quarter of a century; becoming co-editor of  <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Publishers' Weekly</title> in 1918, and chairman of R.R. Bowker &amp; Company in 1958.  
</p>
      <p>
Melcher contributed to the promotion of good literature for children by helping develop Children's Book Week (1919), establishing the John Newbery Medal (1921) for the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children, and establishing the Caldecott Medal, for the best American picture book for children (1937).

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection consists of the personal and professional papers of Frederic G. Melcher, editor of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Publishers' Weekly</title>, particularly those dealing with his collection of materials concerning Robert Frost, but also his relationships to other writers, publishers, and others of the book world. Frederic G. Melcher maintained a warm friendship with Robert Frost throughout his life and this relationship is reflected in the correspondence between the two men.  
</p>
      <p>
These papers, 1865-1963, include correspondence, printed ephemera, news clippings, photographs, manuscripts, etc., ca. 1,375 items (6 Hollinger boxes, 2.5 linear feet). 
</p>
      <p>
Most of the correspondence in series five is addressed to Melcher; when it is not addressed to Melcher either personally or as editor of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Publishers' Weekly</title>, the recipient is noted in the guide. Many of the letters in this section were generated by responses to the invitation to a dinner celebrating Robert Frost's 50th birthday; by Melcher's invitation to various authors or other individuals to come and speak at Montclair, New Jersey; or to answer Melcher's 1934 question for <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Publishers' Weekly</title> concerning recommendations for essential reading in the coming year. 
</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement encodinganalog="351">
      <head>Arrangement
</head>
      <p>The papers are arranged in five series:
Series I: Robert Frost Manuscripts  (Box 1)
Series II: Correspondence of Robert Frost, members of the Frost Family and Frederic G. Melcher (Boxes 1-2)
Series III: Miscellaneous Papers concerning Robert Frost (Boxes 2-3)
Series IV: Miscellaneous Papers concerning Frederic G. Melcher and Other Authors (Boxes 3-4)
Series V: Correspondence of Frederic G. Melcher and Various Authors and Publishers, arranged alphabetically by Name of Correspondent (Boxes 4-6)
</p>
      <p>
All manuscripts and work by Robert Frost, hand-written, typed, or printed are found in the first series and are arranged alphabetically by title. The correspondence between Robert Frost, members of the Frost family, and Frederic G. Melcher is found in the second series and is arranged chronologically. The third series containing miscellaneous items concerning Robert Frost is arranged alphabetically by the type of material; for example advertising items; articles about Frost; a drawing; ephemera; guest lists, invitations, and programs for events involving Frost; news clippings; and photographs of Frost or Frost portraits. 
</p>
      <p>
The fourth series contains any non-correspondence material concerning Melcher or other authors, excluding Robert Frost, and is arranged alphabetically by type of material. The final series comprises the correspondence of Frederic G. Melcher and various authors and publishers, arranged alphabetically by the name of the correspondent and including any carbons of Melcher's letters to that person.

She states that thinking about the book helped her make it through the last year, although "now that it is done, I seem to feel an utter depression that is almost worse than severe physical pain." Robert is at an interval in his lectures at Harvard due to their vacation time but has been busy with other engagements. Elinor also thanks her for the winter of theatre going together.

He also enjoyed her story "Hats" and found its conclusions applicable to publishing (1924); accepts invitation to the Robert Frost dinner, and says, "I'd have been outrageously disappointed to have missed it" (Mar 3, [1925]); shares that she did not enjoy writing <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Her Son's Wife</title> [1926?]; thanks Melcher for his thoughtful and reassuring words about her last book [<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Why Stop Learning</title>?] and expresses her concern over the health of Marjorie Frost (Jan 6, 11, 1928); recommends that Americans make much greater use of the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Encyclopedia</title> in their everyday questions and disputes (Dec 31, 1934); asks for extra copies of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Publisher's Weekly</title> with its excellent photographs of the Skinner Award dinner so she can send them to her friends overseas (1951); thanks Melcher for promising to send her Volume III of the Bowker lectures and mentions that the University of Vermont has been collecting her papers for the last ten years. She also tells of selecting some of her short stories from the last fifty years for publication by Harcourt, Brace and Company (March 4, 1956); and Melcher replies about the importance of collecting the papers of writers, mentioning some of hers in his collection, as well as two favorite photographs of Fisher which  are present in this folder (March 8, 1956).
In her undated correspondence, she mentions the death of her father-in-law just prior to her speaking engagement at Montclair and the need to borrow a copy of her book Hillsboro People for her reading; and mentions the illness of Marjorie Frost.

            <p>obert S. Newdick, professor at Ohio State University, reports on his wonderful four-day visit with Robert Frost and his wife, both of whom promised assistance with his full-length biography. For his bibliography of Frost, he has joined forces with Mr. Green and Mr. Clymer (September 30, 1935). Melcher helps with questions about one of Frost's poems about shoes, one smelling of Atlantic salt and the other Pacific salt and an anecdote concerning the same poem and T.S. Eliot (December 12 &amp; 16, 1935); Melcher warns Newdick to proceed slowly because both Frosts  "have a way of backing away from the responsibility of digging up material from the past" (December 26, 1935; January 3 &amp; 9, 1936); complaints about the style, quantity,  and accuracy of Clymer and Green's contributions to the Frost bibliography about which Melcher agrees that Newdick should proceed on his own (January 27, 1936; February 3 &amp; 25, 1936; March 4, 1936); reports on Frost's appearance and reception at Ohio State University and his invitation for Newdick to visit him during the summer (May 25, 1936); Melcher asks for copies of all Newdick's articles about Frost (July 7, 1936); describes his work on articles about Frost, including one on exhibitions and bibliographies of the work of Robert Frost, mentioning Melcher's own checklist in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Publishers' Weekly</title> and the fuller descriptions in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Colophon</title> (July 29, 1936); discusses the idea of publishing the prose work of Robert Frost (July 29, August 3 &amp; 5, 1936); questions about whether he should do a biography of Frost for Oxford University Press (November 23, 30, 1937; March 4, 7, 9, 10, 1938); and asks for help on a possible paper about the various types of Frost inscriptions in books (September 15, 19, October 2, 21).

J.W.S. supplies this (however badly, at times) while Rackham furnishes the poetry, all ready-made- he's good at that, of course, but best in his simple head- &amp; tail-pieces- too much 'art' in the others- for children" (October 20, 1926).
Bruce Rogers also asks Melcher not to discuss his proposed Prayer Book in <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Publishers' Weekly</title> at this time (May 20, 1927); encloses [Will] Ransom's article on himself and expresses his appreciation of the entire series of articles done by him (May 3, 1928); mentions Carl Rollins review of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Book of Psalms</title>  and a check-list by Alice Lerch (June 18, 20, 1928); thanks Melcher for his subscription to <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Odyssey</title>, a new translation by T.E.

            <p>Lawrance Thompson, recently out of the Navy, asks Melcher for his help in gathering materials for his biography of Robert Frost, and mentions living in one of Frost's many farmhouses in Vermont at Ripton while he spent time with Frost who described the experience as  "walking around the story of my life" (October 10, 1946); Melcher mentions the collection of Charles R. Green and the records made by Columbia University of Robert Frost reading his poetry  (October 14, 1946); Thompson agrees as to the importance of preserving the prose of Robert Frost because he fears that Frost will never get around to doing anything about it, particularly the Charles Eliot Norton lectures (October 17, 21, 1946); promises to bring Melcher some items for his collection and finds his information about August Gehrs' recollections on the sale of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">North of Boston</title> most interesting (November 5, 7, 1946); and supplies gossip about the title of Frost's next book (November 12, 15, 1946). He especially appreciates the use of Melcher's copy of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Rural America</title> because it contains Frost's article "Poetry and the Rural Life." Thompson feels that this article "is his own careful statement that he isn't trying to get everybody back to the farm; he is merely trying to get people to realize the importance of being themselves, and cultivating an Emersonian self-reliance, and by analogy the farm offers a symbol of the kind of withdrawal-from-society in order to get time to strengthen self and create produce for the open market."  He also expresses concern about the preservation of original documents, sharing how two of the persons he contacted about Frost letters had lost them to fire (December 2, 1946). Thompson thanks Melcher for letting him read the Frost-Melcher correspondence and the excerpt from <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Publishers' Weekly</title> for January 22, 1916 about Frost and for all of his additional help on his biography (January 4, 194[7?]); sends a list of detailed questions generated by looking at Melcher's material on Frost which Melcher attempts to answer point by point before going on his trip to Japan in the interest of copyright treaty drafting (February 3, 4, 1947).
