         <famname normal="Pollock family">Pollock</famname>and 
         <famname normal="Janney family">Janney</famname>families
         descended from 
         <persname>Elizabeth Gordon (Lee)</persname>(1813-? ) and 
         <persname>Abraham David Pollock</persname>(1807-1890) of " 
         <corpname>Leeton Forest</corpname>, " 
         <geogname>Fauquier County, Virginia</geogname>.</p>
      <p>Early letters, 1872-1884, are chiefly from 
         <persname>A. D. Pollock</persname>to his daughter, 
         <persname normal="Roberta Pollock">Roberta</persname>. The
         majority of correspondence, 1895-1914, is directed to another
         daughter, 
         <persname normal="Lily Pollock">Lily</persname>, from family
         and friends. Correspondents include her brother-in-law, 
         <persname>Charles Pollock Janney</persname>, married to her
         sister, 
         <persname normal="Nancy Pollock Janney">Nancy Lee</persname>;
         nephews

         <persname>John Janney</persname>(issue of Charles and Nancy
         Janney); nephews 
         <persname>Abraham David Pollock Gilmour</persname>and

         <persname>[Matthew] Gilmour</persname>); 
         <persname>Georgia L. Robertson</persname>; 
         <persname>Ann Lee Peyton</persname>; and others. The letters
         cover personal affairs as well as the management of boarding

      <p>Letters, 1872-1884, from 
         <persname>Abraham David Pollock</persname>are concerned with
         religious matters, his ill health, and personal and family
         affairs. In his letter of November 13, 1872, to his wife, he
         explains his medical condition as told by Dr. Foster of 
         <geogname>Clifton, Virginia</geogname>, and discusses the
         remedy for curing the skin, "electric bath" and "condensed air
         bath." Another letter, September 13, n.y., concerning his
         health, discusses 
         <geogname>Rockbridge Alum</geogname>as a health spa, and
         mentions an anticipated visit from General [ ] Lee and a visit
         by Mrs. 
         <persname>[David Dixon] Porter</persname>, Jr. Letters of
         February 4, 1873 and March 12, 1874 reveal Pollock's preaching
         involvement, mention their baby's ill health, and discuss news
         of various persons. The latter discusses his son Charles being
         offered 
         <persname>Jimmy Chilton</persname>'s place, and possibly the
         Assistant District Attorney position or Assistant in the
         Attorney General's Office. A January 10, 1876 letter from 
         <persname>Charles Lee Pollock</persname>concerns personal and
         family matters, such as Roberta's engagement to [Matthew]
         Gilmour and a visit by 
         <persname>[Charles Pollock] Janney</persname>. A July 14, 1876
         letter from 
         <persname>A. D. Pollock</persname>to Roberta discusses her
         visit to 
         <geogname>Scotland</geogname>and his own trip there
         thirty-five years ago, and mentions the recovery of litle
         Charles Janney. In his letter of April 16, 1884, A. D. Pollock
         discusses visitor 
         <persname>Fanny Briggs</persname>' activities and his new
         hired man, 
         <persname>George Washington</persname>, a brother-in-law of

         <persname>Lily Pollock</persname>, in 
         <geogname>Virginia Beach</geogname>. In his August 8 letter,
         he addresses her invitation to visit by writing that he may
         see her "on the rising of the Convention about Thursday -15th"
         but that his "movements will be governed by developments in my
         Bath County Case, which is assuming interesting proportions."
         On August 19, he mentions their son John's trip to 
         <geogname>Washington, D. C.</geogname>to see Dr. [ ] Patterson
         and some insurance prospects, their daughter 
         <persname normal="Lilias Janney">Lilias</persname>, and Bell

         <persname>Charles C. Mercer</persname>(daughters of 
         <persname>George W. Janney</persname>). In his September 3

         the State Senate, and mentions his having tea with 
         <persname>John Staige Davis</persname>(1872-1946). On
         September 4, he mentions a visit to 
         <geogname>Virginia Beach</geogname>by 
         <persname>James I. Lippincott</persname>. On September 11, he
         writes an interesting letter on a train leaving

         he discusses a land transaction and its possible effect on
         their own family and "

         others. On May 1, 1912, he writes concerning his election by

         "a colored youth named 
         <persname>William McKinley</persname>. " The deaths of 
         <persname>William L. Royal</persname>and

         <geogname>Silver City, New Mexico</geogname>(May 24 and July

         <geogname>Scottsdale</geogname>, through

         over worsening health and bad spells and hopes of improvement
         in 
         <geogname>Denver</geogname>. Letters from Pollock begin after
         Matthew's death in 1904, and discuss family and religious
         matters. On September 12, 1904, he expresses his gratitude for
         her "most loving and self-sacrificing treatment of dear Matt."
         On December 27, 1906, he discusses his work with the 
         <corpname>Union Seminary</corpname>; and, during

         growth of such a young city, and supporting her management of
         the 
         <geogname>Twin Falls</geogname>building. As a mining investor
         in 
         <geogname>Salt Lake City, Utah</geogname>in 1907, John was
         associated with the 
         <corpname>Nevada-Phoenix Mining Company</corpname>and the 
         <corpname>Pioche--Last Chance Mining Company</corpname>, and
         was involved in various business deals. During this period, he
         discusses possible solutions to her financial problems,
         opportunities for investing, and a financial proposition
         (April 27, 1907), and the setting aside of $50,000 worth of
         Pioche stock for her. A lengthy letter, April 27(-October 4),
         1912, from John onboard ship enroute to 
         <geogname>Paris, France</geogname>, describes the trip. By
         1913, John's business investments failed. On January 12, 1913,
         he writes about the problems of business enterprise even
         without outside interference, and also wishes for a
         satisfactory settlement of our war with 
         <geogname>Turkey</geogname>but anticipating a "general
         European confligration [sic]." On July 3, 1913, John writes a
         lengthy discussion on his opinion concerning how man is
         intended to live under God's ordained physical laws and the
         laws of health, and how he has learned to endure difficult
         situations and still keep reasonably well. On October 31,
         1914, John writes from 
         <geogname>Twin Falls, Idaho</geogname>, concerning his farm,
         stating that profits now go into improvements and that he has
         gradually built up one of the best ranches in that area. He
         refers to 
         <geogname>Twin Falls</geogname>as the most prosperous city he
         has been in this year. Letters from Gordon are more concerned
         with thoughts of their mother (December 29, 1907) and her
         death (May 7 &amp; 23, 1908). On July 29, 1912, he writes an
         interesting letter from 
         <geogname>San Francisco, California</geogname>, about his
         impending trip to

         <geogname>Korea</geogname>, and the 
         <geogname>Philippines</geogname>to examine some mining
         properties. He mentions that he has a letter of introduction

         <persname>Charles Henry Brent</persname>(1862-1929).</p>
