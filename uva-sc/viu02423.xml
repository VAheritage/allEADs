      <p>George Palmer Garrett was born on June 11, 1929 in Orlando,
         Florida. After receiving his B.A. from Princeton University in
         1952, he served in the Army. He then returned to his alma
         mater where he wrote his first book, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Reverend Ghost: Poems,</title>and
         completed his graduate education in 1956. From 1956-1970 he
         taught at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut; Rice
         University in Houston, Texas; the University of Virginia; and
         Hollins College in Roanoke, Virginia. During 1970-1974 he was
         writer-in-residence at the University of South Carolina, prior
         to moving to York Harbor, Maine, where he married Susan
         Parrish Jackson. In January 1982, he became professor of
         English at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where he
         remained until his return to the faculty of the University of
         Virginia in September 1985 as Henry Hoyns Professor of
         Creative Writing. He has written over twenty books, including 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">In the Briar Patch</title>(1961),

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 108 items, 1949-1986, which
         relate to the career of George Palmer Garrett as a novelist,
         poet, short story writer, critic, and lecturer. Included are
         announcements and programs of his public appearances,
         newspaper clippings and other printed material about his life
         and his works, and a scrapbook of similar material compiled by
         his sister, Rozanne Epps. In addition to material documenting
         Garrett's career, there are two of his manuscripts, "Enchanted
         Ground" and "The Hunter's View," notes for a lecture, and
         letters to A.C. and Rozanne Epps. Many of the letters mention
         his scheduling for lectures, but he also writes an interesting
         piece on what he looks for in a novel or story (September 30,
         1949); says that he is up for consideration for a job in
         Charlottesville and that he wants them--along with "Harry the
         Meach" [Harry Meacham]--to set up a reading in Richmond
         (October 10, 1961); and sends along some tapes he made for
         them of a wedding. Also included is a note, November 16, 1967,
         from Harry Meacham to Rozanne and A.C. Epps about a review of
         Garrett's poetry by a Dr. Locke.</p>
