      <p>This collection consists of two letters sent to members of
         the Preston Family of Abingdon, Virginia. The first three-page
         letter, July 25, 1791, is from William Russell, North Garden,
         to Captain Francis Preston, Montgomery County, Virginia, who
         thanks Preston for helping his son proceed on to his business
         in Richmond, mentions searching for horses which apparently
         had zigzagged up the New River, and expresses thankfulness
         that peace has been restored between the United States and the
         Cherokees through the signing of the Holston Treaty on July 2,
         1791. Russell describes the terms of the treaty, which made
         the Cherokee- United States boundary the watershed between the
         Little River and the Little Tennessee River, in great detail
         in his letter. He also informs Preston that some inhabitants
         down the river are dissatisfied with the treaty because they
         fall within the Indian lands.</p>
      <p>The second four-page letter, April 26, 1834, is from C.C.
         Lee, Spring Camp, [Christiansburg], to Mrs. Sarah Buchanan
         Preston, Abingdon, explains the reasons for his political
         defeat in the recent election in Floyd, Virginia. Lee was
         accused of indulging in a wild bacchanal with young girls atop
         Buffalo Mountain on Easter Sunday, of being a "nullifier"
         because he mentioned in his speech the spirit and patriotism
         of some of the men supporting the "Carolina doctrines," of
         being a bank man because he did not support "the experiment"
         and would not support Andrew Jackson's administration "right
         or wrong." Lee also mentions that Governor Floyd gave a speech
         at the election but feared that "the mysteries of state
         sovereignty &amp; the banking system found no catching place
         on the bumpless pericraniums of our bumpkins."</p>
