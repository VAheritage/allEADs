      <p>Green was a native of Culpeper, Virginia where he had been
         a lawyer and commissioner of courts before enlisting in
         Company C as a lieutenant in April, 1861. He served as
         regimental quartermaster until appointed to the rank of major
         and as commissary for [George Edward] Pickett's Division,
         Kemper's (and later [William Richard] Terry's) Brigade, Army
         of Northern Virginia, in June, 1862. Green served in this
         capacity until his regiment surrendered at Appomattox in
         April, 1865. He founded the Culpeper "Exponent" in 1881 and
         died three years later.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The volume contains Green's accounts on the amount of
         provisions received from or issued at the camps under Kemper's
         command (including the 7th, 11th, 17th, and 27th Virginia
         Infantry regiments and the Loudoun Artillery) as well as a
         quarantine hospital and employees of the Quartermaster
         Department. Several regimental commissary officers are
         mentioned frequently. Also present are reports concerning
         monthly summary statements ("Form 6") and current quarterly
         accounts ("Form 7"); the entries begin in May, 1862 and
         continue to December, 1864. Edible provisions, listed in
         pounds or gallons, include: pork, beef, flour, bread, rice,
         peas, vinegar, salt, dried apples, sugar, molasses, whiskey,
         fish, coffee, mutton, corn meal, potatoes, fruit, crackers,
         and pickles. Candles, soap, lard, and tobacco were also
         issued.</p>
      <p>For the quarter ending September 30, 1864 Green provides an
         inventory of commissary office supplies issued, received or
         remaining on hand; letter and calf paper, steel pens,
         memorandum books, pencils, bottles of black ink, rulers, scale
         balances, butcher knives, barrels, and empty sacks are among
         the items enumerated. Major Green served as temporary
         commissary chief for Brigadier Generals Eppa Hunton
         (1822-1908) in October, 1863 and Robert Frederick Hoke
         (1837-1912) in April, 1864. He had a plethora of supplies to
         categorize and disburse as a result of the capture of the
         Union base at Plymouth, North Carolina, on April 20, 1864, and
         this is reflected in his records. Green's June, 1870 income
         tax receipt, showing the amount he paid at Culpeper Court
         House on his yearly income and two gold watches, is contained
         with this collection. Further information on Green may be
         found in David F. Rigg's
