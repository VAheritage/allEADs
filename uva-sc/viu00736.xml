      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This modest collection of eight letters and letter
         fragments, 1861-1864, n.d., chiefly pertains to 
         <persname>Henry B. Bosserman</persname>and 
         <persname>Amanda Bosserman</persname>and consists of news from
         relatives and friends in the 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>counties of 
         <geogname>Augusta</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Highland</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Rockbridge</geogname>during the Civil War. Among
         these are indirect references to members of the 
         <corpname>5th Virginia Infantry</corpname>. [Researchers using
         this collection should note that many of the correspondents
         and places mentioned in this guide were identified by a
         manuscripts dealer.]</p>
      <p>In his August 7, 1861 letter 
         <persname>William B. Bosserman</persname>informs 
         <persname>Henry Bosserman</persname>that he has no tidings but
         requests "shilling tobacco" and writing pens; William also
         requests that Henry reply to his letters as "I don't like to
         write and get no answer." An incomplete letter of September 8,
         1861, addressed to Henry as "Dear Brother" complains that the
         winter has been so hard that clothing is difficult to obtain
         and there is much sickness in 
         <geogname>Fisherville</geogname>; coffee sells for fifty
         cents, and bacon is twenty-five cents, per pound,
         respectively. This correspondent also makes references to not
         having a husband.</p>
      <p>Five of the letters were addressed to 
         <persname>Amanda Bosserman</persname>from her niece, 
         <persname>Francina M. Bosserman</persname>, as well as from 
         <persname>Mollie Hall</persname>and 
         <persname>Mollie Lowman</persname>. On December 13, 1863,
         Francina, writing from 
         <geogname>Kerr's Creek, Rockbridge County</geogname>, mentions
         having attended religious services in the morning and evening
         and that the 
         <corpname>[Augusta] Home Guard</corpname>had been called out
         for duty the previous day, consequently, all of the "main men"
         have gone. This letter is continued on December 22 with
         comments on the availability of two "good looking men" and of
         how the weather has turned very cold. Francina's April 27,
         1864 letter informs her aunt (who was at that time residing at
         Arbor Hill) that 
         <persname>David Argenbright</persname>[ 
         <corpname>Company F, 5th Virginia Infantry</corpname>] is home
         and has been detailed for hospital duty. Corporal 
         <persname>David Francis Argenbright</persname>(1839-1902),
         sick for most of 1862-1863, was declared unfit for duty on the
         day of 
         <persname>Francina Bosserman</persname>'s letter (April 27,
         1864) but later served at a 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>hospital and was eventually
         paroled at 
         <geogname>Appomattox</geogname>.</p>
      <p><persname>Mollie Hall</persname>'s December 30, 1862 letter
         addresses Amanda as "Sis" and expresses sympathy that she
         (Bosserman) is suffering from neuralgia. Hall laments the lack
         of men in 
         <geogname>Augusta</geogname>during the Christmas holiday and
         pities the hard times suffered by the soldiers; she hopes the
         war will soon end, declares that calico is costly at two
         dollars per yard, and commiserates with Bosserman over their
         stolen sheep.</p>
      <p><persname>Mollie Lowman</persname>'s letter to Amanda is
         undated. It was written at 
         <geogname>Walker's Creek</geogname>to Bosserman (at 
         <geogname>Mount Hope</geogname>) and she reports that a
         regiment of cavalry is stationed in the neighborhood but she
         has only met one of its members, a Mr. Nelson of 
         <geogname>Monroe County</geogname>who Hall declares is nice
         enough but is a "pokeroot". She also asserts that "I had the
         very pokeroot last Sunday at church" and "you will enjoy
         yourself fine if you do have to take pokeroot." There is a
         letter fragment in Lowman's handwriting [addressed to Amanda?]
         during which she mentions a soldier relative as suffering from
         liver troubles, an outbreak of diphtheria, and the mailing
         address for the 
         <corpname>5th Virginia Infantry</corpname>, care of a Captain
         [ 
         <persname>George T.] Antrim</persname>[ 
         <corpname>Company H, West Augusta Rifles, 5th Virginia
         Infantry</corpname>].</p>
      <p>In a July 31, 1861 letter written in 
         <geogname>Green Springs, Rockbridge County</geogname>, and
         addressed to "Respected Brother" [a Confederate soldier?] the
         unidentified writer informs him that the family is well and
         that he or she has sent clothing to him.</p>
