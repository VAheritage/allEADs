      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p><persname>Millie Richards Stone Gray</persname>(1800-1851) of 
         <geogname>Fredericksburg, Virginia</geogname>kept a diary from
         January 1822 until May 1829. She wrote of her life and her
         husband and her children, as well as local and national
         events. The diary is a good source on life in 1800s
         Fredericksburg and it compliments area histories.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Gray wrote mostly about her daily life and spent most
         of it in Fredericksburg after marrying 
         <persname>William Fairfax Gray</persname>in 1817. A great deal
         of her time was spent receiving vistors or visiting friends
         and family. She also spent time with the 
         <corpname>Circle of Industry</corpname>, which seemed to be a
         sewing circle; and, put together a craft fair. Mrs. Gray also
         wrote of shopping trips, changing homes, servants, and
         attending 
         <corpname>St. George's Episcopal Church</corpname>. She used
         the diary to record some recipes and inventories.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Gray had at least eight children. In the diary, she
         mentions 
         <persname>Peter Gray</persname>, 
         <persname>Jane Gray</persname>, 
         <persname>Evelina Gray</persname>, 
         <persname>George Fairfax Gray</persname>, 
         <persname>Ann* Gray</persname>, 
         <persname>Franklin Gray</persname>, and two other children.
         One son died prior to 1822; daughter Jane in 1823; and, son
         George in 1825. She mentions her children during important
         events in their life, such as christenings, travels, their
         private school education, and illnesses.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Gray mentions her husband fleetingly in each entry,
         referring to him as "Mr. Gray," giving the diary a formal
         tone; he was twelve years older than his wife. He published
         several books and was the editor and proprietor of the 
         <corpname>Virginia Herald</corpname>. His literary profession
         provided many opportunities for travel, taking him frequently
         to 
         <geogname>Washington</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Alexandria</geogname>. Mr. Gray was a Mason and
         while in 
         <geogname>Fredericksburg</geogname>became Master of the Lodge.
         He was also a colonel in the army through membership in the 
         <corpname>Washington Guard</corpname>, attended his lodge
         meetings as well as meetings of the literary and music
         societies, and was active in the fire commission and in local
         politics. He left Fredericksburg in 1835 and travelled to 
         <geogname>Texas</geogname>where he ultimately settled; his
         [published] diary gives detailed information of these
         travels.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Gray often writes of her extended family. Her father
         and mother were frequent visitors, and she wrote of her
         father's death in 1827. She also writes about her four
         sisters: 
         <persname>Mary Stone</persname>, 
         <persname>Evelina Stone</persname>, 
         <persname>Louisa Stone</persname>, and 
         <persname>Margaret Stone</persname>. Mary married 
         <persname>Thomas Botts</persname>; Evelina married 
         <persname>Charles Smith</persname>; Louisa married 
         <persname>John Triplett</persname>; and, Margaret married Dr.
         Brown. It is unclear whether this Dr. Brown is the Dr. Browne
         who is frequently mentioned in the diary. She seemed to be the
         closest to Evelina and Mary.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Gray also mentions events in Fredericksburg and the
         nation, including topics such as the weather, disease, deaths,
         medicine, fires, General 
         <persname>LaFayette</persname>'s visit, and transportation.
         Each entry begins with an account of the weather. She
         frequently wrote about illness and medicine, referring to
         lockjaw, consumption, smallpox, the croup, toothaches,
         headaches, and colds, and to leeching as the cureall for these
         ailments. The diary recounts the events surrounding the great
         fire of 1822, during which the 
         <famname>Gray Family</famname>lost their home, as well as
         other smaller fires in Fredericksburg during this period.
         Another fascinating event that occurred in Fredericksburg was
         the visit of General 
         <persname>LaFayette</persname>in 1824. Mr. Gray addressed
         LaFayette as Master of the 
         <corpname>Masonic Lodge</corpname>and invited him to become a
         member. The diary offers a very good first hand account of the
         visit and the general excitement it caused. The diary also
         mentions the modes of transporation in use at the time: giggs,
         steamboats, stagecoaches, and other forms of horse travel.
         Mrs. Gray also mentions national events, such as the election
         of 
         <persname>John Quincy Adams</persname>and 
         <persname>Andrew Jackson</persname>, the deaths of 
         <persname>Thomas Jefferson</persname>and 
         <persname>John Adams</persname>, a fire in 
         <geogname>Alexandria, Virginia</geogname>an Indian raid, and
         the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of
         Independence.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Gray used the diary to record events of interest and
         to document historical events. She wrote a great deal about
         her daily life along with her children and husband. It is an
         interesting look into the life of a young woman's life from
         her point of view. Relevant and complementary information may
