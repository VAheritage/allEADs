      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>1860: Two entries in September--19th and 30th--describe
         receiving money for mourning clothes and the sadness and
         distress of her daughter-in-law Liz. (William Hill had just
         died). There are eight undated entries in which Mrs. Hill
         tells of leaving Stratford [ ? ] to go to New York with Eliza
         and Mrs. [ ] Springs, where they board at the Bond Street
         House while purchasing mourning dresses and bonnets. She also
         describes going to Greenwood to purchase a monument for
         William. They are joined by Liz and Tom and leave New York for
         home, stopping off at Enfield, N.C., to visit Governor Branch.
         Mrs. Hill remains there a week with Liz.</p>
      <p>1862: Mar 5, Mrs. Hill describes leaving Wilmington for
         Chapel Hill with Eliza Hill and Lieutenant Mason (James M.) ,
         where they board at a hotel while trying to get "more
         comfortable" rooms. She mentions the difficulties in obtaining
         other rooms because of large influx of families from
         Wilmington and comments on Mar 10 that "tho' there are many
         things unpleasant about a hotel in a village, still in these
         distressing wartimes we must learn to accommodate ourselves to
         circumstances." Most of the March entries generally deal with
         the arrival of other evacuees, church activites and
         accommodation to day-to-day life in wartime. Specifically, on
         Mar 11 she relates that she and Eliza have decided to stay in
         the hotel and that Eliza has two or three students to see her
         each night. On Mar 12, she mentions that Governor Swain (David
         Lowry) and his wife have called. On Mar 15, she says the
         taking of Newberne, N.C. has been confirmed--"how distressing
         it is to hear what inroads the Yankees are making into our
         state." Mar 22 brings the arrival of Tom, whom she had not
         heard from in five weeks and thought sick or dead. He has
         indeed been ill with typhoid fever and jaundice and has not
         even a change of clothes. Mar 27 finds Tom recovering slowly
         and Lieut. Mason arriving to be with Eliza. Mar 26, she writes
         that it soon will be reported that Eliza is engaged. Mar 29,
         Lieut. Mason leaves.</p>
      <p>April, 1862: April entries continue with daily life in the
         hotel, the arrival of new boarders, descriptions of church and
         social activities and concerns for the loved ones serving in
         the war. Apr 3, Tom calls on Dr. Mallett and is told to get an
         extension to his furlough that "he is not in a state to return
         to camp." Apr 6, she mentions going to the Episcopal church
         and finding every seat taken up with refugees. Apr 7, Liz is
         at the hotel but will change rooms today; Joe writes from his
         home in Georgia that he has returned from his regiment to
         attend to a variety of things at home. Few gentlemen callers
         for Eliza now that they think she is engaged. Apr 14, she
         writes--"We have had good news from Corinth--Buel killed (Gen.
         Don Carlos) and Beauregard (Gen. Pierre Gustave) has taken
         (report says) 30,000 prisoners. But then on the back of this
         news we learn that Pulaski [ ] has surrendered." Apr 15 Tom's
         furlough is extended. Apr 16 Mrs. Hill comes down with cholera
         and is sick for two days. Apr 16 Jessie [ ] and her family
         arrive from Durham and report that Wilmington is totally
         deserted by inhabitants except for soldiers.. beef selling at
         50 cents a pound, butter at 75 cents and people fighting over
         it. Apr 22, plans are in the works for concert for the
         "gunboat fund."</p>
      <p>May, 1862: May entries are taken with church activities,
         sewing and visiting among the refugees in Chapel Hill. She
         writes of friends in the hotel and their losses,walking about
         Chapel Hill and how weather affects her moods. May 5, the
         students begin leaving; May 6, Tom mentions his upcoming
         departure. May 7, the "conscript law" is taking all students
         away from Chapel Hill. May 10, hears from Joe that he is to be
         sent with his regiment to St. John's Island--writes that she
         has a horror of islands as war experiences have been bad
         there. May 14, Tom leaves for the Peninsula and she grieves
         his leaving. May 20 hears from Joe that his regiment is
         stationed at Logansville, S. C., a beautiful summer retreat
         for residents of Charleston. Tom also writes from Enfield that
         he is remaining there a few days. May 22, hears that Fred has
         gone into "his country's service" and she is weighed down with
         sorrow... "I have wept until my tears refuse to flow. The
         enemy is at our very doors and each man must do his duty." May
         25, hears from Tom in Richmond and will go on picket duty
         (Noah--his manservant is with him). May 26, learns of fighting
         in Richmond and fears for Tom. May 30, Eliza hears from Mr.
         Mason that he has been very sick and too ill to join his
         regiment May 31, Mrs. Hill learns Fred has joined a Cavalry
         company in Starke's (Peter B.) regiment from Washington County
         in Mississippi--"a large proportion of the company are wealthy
         gentlemen from that county."</p>
      <p>June, 1862 Entries this month deal primarily with war news.
         June 2, Mrs. Hill learns Union Army has not taken Richmond.
         June 7, receives letter from Tom writing about experiences
         around Richmond saying that he wasn't engaged in fighting.
         June 8, Mrs. Hill learns of fighting around Charleston. June
         13, she hears from Tom that his regiment under Capt. [ ]
         Sessions was involved in much skirmishing only 1/2 mile from
         enemy- - everyone at hotel is much cheered by Stonewall
         Jackson's victory over Banks (Gen. Nathaniel P.) and also
         Shields (Gen. James). June 15, learns of Stuart's (Gen.
         J.E.B.) vistory on the Chickahominy-- receives a letter from
         Tom with vivid description of Confederates now occupying a
         beautiful home recently deserted by Yankees and pitiful
         condition in which it was left. June 21, hears from Tom of his
         promotion and the duties and privileges it entails. June 22,
         learns that Burnside (Gen. Ambrose E.) has sent from Norfolk
         and Suffolk 6000 troops to take Weldon and that Yankees have
         been shelling the 18th Mississippi regiment. June 25, writes
         that Joe's regiment now is on St. James' Island right in "face
         of the enemy" with which they were engaged in heavy fighting.
         June 26, a letter from Joe says he has been in no engagement
         so far but that his horse is untrained. June 27, the entry
         gives 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Richmond Times-Dispatch</title>details
         about battle around Richmond which proved victorious for
         Confederates although she is worried about Tom's fate and
         learns of the deaths of two of his acquaintances.</p>
      <p>July, 1862: July 4, learns that friends Willie Wooster and
         Duncan Moore have been killed and that William DeRossett is
         missing, bringing more unhappiness to the DeRossett family
         "who have lost five of their ten or twelve children in the
         last few months." July 8, describes suffering of a young wife
         with two children upon learning of husband's death and
         mentions that Dr. [ ] Mallett plans to go to Richmond to bring
         back 80 wounded to be nursed in Chapel Hill--still no word
         from Tom. July 9, is worried about Tom's silence. July 11,
         afraid Tom may be sick and unable to write. July 15, Mrs. Hill
         finally receives letter from Tom saying he had not been in the
         battle of Richmond but as an "Ordnance Sergeant" had to be
         with his wagon...writes details of fighting. Eliza also hears
         from Mr. Mason, who still is in Goochland where his health is
         improving. July 18, a letter from Joe details circumstances
         surrounding his departure from the service, saying that he now
         has a substitute for whom he paid $600. He has been ill and
         found soldiering "too arduous" and mentioned "ignorance and
         complaining in high places." He has returned home to his
         family. July 25 ,she learns Mr. Mason has been attached to
         General Winder's brigade (John Henry). July 31, Eliza is ill
         with toothache and has "very swollen face."</p>
      <p>August, 1862: August entries deal largely with day-to-day
         life in Chapel Hill with Mrs. Hill's preocupations including
         sewing, knitting, chatting in the parlor and occasionally
         shopping (although the stores are mostly empty). Aug 12, Tom
         writes he has returned to his campground near Richmond after a
         12 to 15 mile march to Malvern Hill to meet the enemy, only to
         find it had fallen back. Aug 13, she learns that the Governor
         of Georgia has ordered every fifth able-bodied Negro be sent
         to Savannah to work on entrenchments. There is no news from
         Mr. Mason though she knows he was at Gordonsville with General
         Winder (John Henry), who was killed at Cedar Mountain. Aug 20,
         all women in the hotel go out to have shoes made at a cost of
         $6 a pair. Aug 21, Liz is making a shaker bonnet to wear when
         "walking out." Eliza is making a pair of gaiters Aug 28, Mr.
         Mason has arrived--thinner and older but as pleasant as
         ever--he describes how he was sent to Winchester with four
         others--all of whom dressed in Yankee clothes to attempt to
         obtain special information, which they got under dangerous
         circumstances.</p>
      <p>September, 1862: Sep 4, learns of victory at Manassas but
         fears "my precious child may be lying on the battlefield in
         death's cold grasp." Sep 6, Eliza leaves for Pittsboro, N.C.
         with an escort to pay a visit to a friend. She bemoans the
         loss of Ewell (Gen. Richard Stoddart), who was "Jackson's
         right hand man" and tells other war news, including the
         urgency to complete works in defence of Cape Fear--a key to
         the whole section of the North Carolina coast. Sep 9, gives
         praise to the Lord for victory at Manassas and quotes the
         Northern papers as saying : "During the battle a commanding
         figure, supposed to have been Jackson, was seen in the front
         and thickest of the fight, mounted on a splendid charger, and
         moving his sword aloft, urging on his troops."Sep 11, Eliza
         receives letter from Mason, but it is forwarded to Pittsboro,
         so Mrs. Hill learns nothing of Tom. Confederate troops have
         crossed the Potomac and now are in Maryland..she details her
         knowledge of the crossing, and describes destruction of
         Winchester by the Yankees upon their evacuation. Sep. 13,
         concerns mount because of no word from Tom--is forwarding
         letters from Mason to Eliza. Sep 15, a letter arrives from
         Tom, written from Leesburg Sep 5. Sep 16, Sarah receives two
         letters from Fred which vividly detail his cavalry engagement
         with the enemy. He is at "Begone Phalich" on a river that runs
         through "this county and Washington county." Sep 17, yellow
         fever is rampant in Wilmington and "everyone is leaving town"
         writes of fair being organized by young girls in Chapel Hill
         to raise money for soldiers. Sep 21, Harper's Ferry has been
         taken and writes of what she hears of the surrender. Sep 21,
         more reports on Harper's Ferry and Antietam. Sep 23, learns
         Tom is in General McLaws'(Lafayette) Division (Lafayette). Sep
         24, yellow fever still spreading in Wilmington. Sep 26, Fred
         writes he is in Bolivar County, no engagement yet, but cavalry
         up to 160 under Col. Starke. Sep 28, fever raging in
         Wilmington and have sent to Charleston and Richmond for nurses
         and physicians; quotes the Bible as saying that before the end
         of the world, we will have "war, pestilence and famine" and
         the first two are upon us and the other fast approaching.</p>

         which she appreciated but thought a little fervent. Oct 2, no
         news from Tom..reports of deaths of friends in Wilmington, has
         heard Tom was not injured in last battle..thinks Lincoln's
         last proclamation will "raise the South anew."Oct 4, receives
         letter from Tom..his regiment resting after several hard
         fought battles about two miles from Martinsburg..he has been

         of helping take Harper's Ferry." Oct 5, "quite a panic" in
         Chapel Hill because of a Negro man dying of yellow fever. Oct

         Winchester "where country has been wasted by Yankees." Oct 12,
         tells of a "gang of Negroes" having taken Richard Bradley's
         boat the "Hiawatha" when it was loaded with "darkies" and
         taking it to the Yankee blockading fleet...hears three or four
         hundred sick with yellow fever in Wilmington with forty to
         sixty new cases a day. Oct. 14, learns Fred was not in battle
         near Corinth (Miss.) but still is in Washington County and
         expects to remain there to guard the river from gunboats. Oct.

         servant Noah sent to him. Tom reports for several days he has
