      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection consists chiefly of typescripts of poems copied out for Agnes Cook and
                letters to her.</p>
      <p>Carman discusses the writing and publication of his poems; expounds the doctrines of
                Unitarianism and the fallacies of Christian Science; and shares misgivings (early in
                1917) about Woodrow Wilson with his "moral cowardice and callous egotism." He also
                mentions the selling of letters from departed celebrities to autograph hunters and
                recommends she read Vachel Lindsay.</p>
      <p>Correspondence mentions Richard Hovey, Mary Perry King, Odell Shepard, Anne Higginson
                Spicer, and Susan Hays Ward.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains an inscribed photograph post card of Carman; three
                printed copies of his poems; a partial bibliography; and obituaries.</p>

                            [published September 1, 1892] and that he has a new poem "just born this

                            also of New Canaan, so that Gale can make her own plans to come East,
                            attempts to explain Unitrinianism, saying "I have been a student of
                            philosophy all my life; not a scholar, of course, but an eager learner.
                            I had to have some faith to live by, some scheme of things which would
                            keep the universe from looking absurd. Unitrinianism has served me well
                            for twenty years." Carman goes on to describe some of the basic tenets
                            and beliefs of Unitrinianism, especially the ideas of Mrs. King's
                            system. He also credits the difficulty of most educators to see the
                            value of harmonizing the whole being to the fact that most of them are
                            men, "And men are much less in need of harmonizing than women. In the
                            first place they are not so delicately constructed, and not so easily
                            distraught and injured by life. Women are often unhinged by sorrow, or
                            unhappiness, or misfortune, that would have no such radical and lasting
                            effect on men at all."</p>
