      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of items pertaining to Edward C.
         Carrington, Eliza Carrington and Virginia Carrington of
         Virginia. In the earliest letter, January 17, 1828, Edward
         C[odrington] Carrington (1790- 1855), Richmond, writes to
         General Francis Preston, Abingdon, Washington County, thanking
         him for the prompt granting of his request for an advance
         which he hopes to return in June.</p>
      <p>A letter, August 18 [1860 ?], from J.H. Means, Buckhead, to
         Mrs. Eliza [Preston] Carrington (1796-1876), regretfully
         informs her that he did not have any letters from her brother
         [William Campbell] Preston (1794-1860) suitable for
         publication, promises to furnish a reminiscence, and testifies
         to his eloquent and moving speeches and nobility of
         character.</p>
      <p>Letters referring to the Civil War include one, October 7,
         1861, from W.[A.?] Glasgow, Fincastle, Virginia, to Mrs. E.H.
         Carrington, telling her that he had obtained a restraining
         injunction to prevent Thom [a slave?] from being taken by the
         Army. Mr. Young had agreed to give him up and to deduct the
         hire of Thom from the first and turn him over to Mr. Thompson
         to dispose of for the balance of the year. Glasgow had also
         gone to Fairfax Courthouse to get Charles Spears, sick with
         typhoid fever, and brought him back on a litter. In another
         letter, William Robinson, Office for Exchange of Prisoners,
         War Department, Richmond, to Mrs. Carrington, May 31, 1864,
         includes a copy of a letter from James McDowell Carrington to
         his brother in Washington City about his recent capture and
         asking for monetary help.</p>
      <p>A letter, March 18 [n.y.] from Senator William C. Preston
         (1794-1860), Columbia, South Carolina, to Virginia Carrington,
         daughter of Edward C. and Eliza Carrington, shares family news
         and pleads with Virginia to visit him.</p>
      <p>Other documents include a resolution, April 2, 1855, of the
         Sons of Temperance, Fincastle Division No. 107, referring to
         the death of General Edward C. Carrington; and a report from
         General Edward C. Carrington, as the representative for the
         stock of the state of Virginia in the annual meetings of the
         Roanoke Navigation Company, recommending that a canal be built
         between Danville, Virginia, and Weldon, North Carolina, to
         make it easier for produce from that part of the state to make
         it to markets on the eastern coast of Virginia.</p>
