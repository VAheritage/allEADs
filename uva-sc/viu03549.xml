      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of 744 items (5 Hollinger boxes,
         ca. 1.7 linear feet), four bound volumes, and two oversize
         items, covering the years 1854 (1900-1940) 1981. The
         collection contains very little correspondence; many autograph
         and typed manuscripts form the bulk of the papers. Also
         included are publications, reprints, pamphlets, minutes,
         newspaper clippings, church records, receipts, sermons,
         brochures, a scrapbook, films, photographs, and miscellaneous
         printed items. Major areas of interest are the history of
         education in the Ragged and Blue Ridge Mountains, the history
         of public education in Virginia, the history of the Episcopal
         Church in Virginia, and the life of Frederick W. Neve
         (1855-1948), the founder of the mountain mission movement of
         the Episcopal Church in Virginia, 1888-1948, as well as a poet
         and prolific writer.</p>
      <p>Frederick William Neve, born in the county of Kent,
         England, was educated at Merton College, Oxford, and ordained
         a deacon in 1880 at the abbey church of St. Albans (his
         certificate of ordination is in this collection). In 1888, the
         vestries of St. Paul's (Ivy) and Emmanuel (Greenwood) Churches
         asked Neve to come to Virginia, and he accepted. In 1890 Neve
         built his first church in the Ragged Mountains, St. John the
         Baptist. Ten years later he began supporting a teacher at
         Simmon's Gap, an isolated community in the Blue Ridge
         Mountains. This was the beginning of his work with the
         mountain people that eventually embraced seven Virginia
         counties and became the Archdeaconry of the Blue Ridge.</p>
      <p>This collection amply documents Neve's early struggles with
         establishing mission schools in this area. There are two of
         his own accounts (typescripts) - his memories [1914] and an
         autobiography [1940]; in addition, there are ca. 365 issues of
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Our Mountain Work</title>, 1909-1954, a
         monthly publication edited by Neve and published by the
         Advisory Board of the Archdeaconry of the Blue Ridge. 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Our Mountain Work</title> features
         detailed accounts and stories regarding the various mountain
         missions, and includes Neve's poetry, most of which was
         written between 1917 and 1930. Other items in the collection
         illustrating Neve's poetical aspirations are a book of
         published poems and a printed poem-hymn, "Gentleness".</p>
      <p>In addition to writing for and editing 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Our Mountain Work</title>, Neve also
         wrote a weekly column ("The Thousandfold Page") for the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Southern Churchman</title>between 1930
         and 1940. This collection contains ca. 33 of these printed
         columns.</p>
      <p>In 1917, when more mission schools were serving more
         students than at any time in the history of the Archdeaconry
         of the Blue Ridge, Neve focused on a new project: the founding
         of the "Order of the Thousandfold," his formalized movement
         designed to unite the world in prayer. In 1921, the
         Theological Seminary of Virginia awarded Neve an honorary
         Doctor of Divinity degree. Until his death in 1948, Archdeacon
         Neve worked vigorously, through both the spoken and printed
         word, trying to turn the thousandfold idea into a world-wide
         movement.</p>
      <p>For further biographical information on Neve, see the
         following: Special Collections Department accessions #9115 and
         #9970, Neve's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Autobiography</title>published in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Magazine of Albemarle County
         History</title>, XXVI (1967- 1968), and Dexter Ralph Davison's
         dissertation, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Frederick W. Neve: Mountain Mission
         Education in Virginia, 1888-1948</title>, which is also
         available in the department.</p>
      <p>In 1963, as a retirement project, the Rev. Dennis Whittle,
         who had worked with Neve as a missionary between 1922 and
         1948, began collecting material on Neve and his mountain work.
         Due to his efforts, most of the manuscripts and published
         material relating to the mountain work of the Archdeaconry of
         the Blue Ridge are preserved in this collection. Whittle had
         planned to write a book on Neve, but he soon felt he was too
         old to complete the project. This collection contains
         Whittle's extensive notes for his intended biography, his
         unpublished articles about Neve, letters to him regarding the
         compilation of Neve material, and even some of his own family
         correspondence, including a letter from Francis McNeece
         Whittle, bishop of the Diocese of Virginia, 1876-1902.</p>
      <p>The manuscripts describing life in the mountain missions
         and Neve's work there are of special interest. Written by
         various individuals who performed a direct role in the
         arcdeaconry, they provide valuable descriptions of mountain
         home and church life. Some noteworthy examples are Susan
         Preston's "Life in Pocosan Hollow," H. H. Williams'
         "Missionary Recollections," Dr. George Mayo's "Early
         Experiences in the Blue Ridge," and Elizabeth E. Winegar's
         "Some Incidents in My Life in the Blue Ridge Mountains of
         Virginia." In addition, these manuscripts are complemented by
         two scrapbooks of photographs, as well as many individual
         photos, giving a good picture of the Virginia mountain
         missions during the early twentieth century.</p>
      <p>Official records, too, are extensive in this collection.
         There are minutes of the Advisory Board of the Archdeaconry of
         the Blue Ridge, extracts from the register of St. Paul's
         Parish, 1887-1928, resolutions pertaining to Archdeacon Neve's
         death, a record book of St. Paul's and Emmanuel Churches,
         1859-1876, a minute book of St. Paul's, 1867-1947, a minute
         book of the Albemarle Convention of Churches, 1897-1912, and
         various receipts, legal and financial records, and
         correspondence of St. Paul's Church (53 items, 1854-1945).</p>
      <p>Peripherally, there is also research material of D. Ralph
         Davison, Jr., who wrote his dissertation on Neve with the aid
         of the Rev. Whittle's collection. This consists of some
         correspondence, notes, articles, and printed material.</p>

      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>There was no discernible order to the collection when it
         was received by the Library. It was organized into series by
         type of material and arranged within each series
         chronologically: I. Correspondence, II. Manuscripts and
         Writings, III. Printed Material and Miscellaneous, IV.
         Photographs, V. Bound Volumes, VI. Oversize and VII. Motion
         Picture Films. The material in Series III has been divided
         into two Subseries: A. Printed
         Material, and B. Miscellaneous, each with a chronological
         arrangement.</p>
