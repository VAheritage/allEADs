      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The McCreas have produced children's books together, such
         as 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Story of Olaf</title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The King's Procession</title>, having
         written the stories, designed the books, executed the
         illustrations, and set the type, pulling the proofs on their
         own hand presses. The couple have also worked together on book
         jackets, advertisements, and other graphic materials. They are
         the parents of three children, James, Ruth, &amp; Claire.</p>
      <p>The McCreas first met Chappell during his night class in
         Book Design at New York University around 1950 and continued
         their friendship through an exchange of notes, cards, and
         greetings, and an occasional visit to the Chappell's homes in
         New York, on James Street in Norwalk, Connecticut, and in
         Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>
