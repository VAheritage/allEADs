      <p>Dr. John W. Gantt (1797?-1860) was the son of Henry Gantt,
         a former Prince George County, Maryland, resident who lived in
         North Gardens, Albemarle County, from 1813 to December 1821 on
         a 784-acre estate near Cross Roads. After winning a $40,000
         Maryland lottery he returned to that state and gave his
         Albemarle holdings to his son John. Dr. Gantt later moved to
         another farm in the county and was appointed a magistrate in
         1830. He and his wife Sarah had four children; seven years
         later he sold this farm to Joseph Sutherland but continued to
         reside in Albemarle.¹</p>
      <p>The 1860 federal census, taken shortly before Dr. Gantt's
         death, enumerated him as a sixty-three-year-old farmer in St.
         Anne's Parish with his wife and children (Henry, Octavia,
         Price and Thomas); he owned $90,000 in real estate and $78,155
         as personal estate. His eldest son, twenty-seven-year-old
         Henry Gantt, also a farmer, owned $15,600 in real estate and
         $14,590 as personal estate. Father and son together owned 83
         slaves as of September 1860: John Gantt, 62 slaves, his son
         Henry, 21 slaves. During the Civil War, Henry Gantt
         (1831-1884), a 1851 graduate of Virginia Military Institute,
         served the Confederacy as colonel of the 19th Virginia
         Infantry.²</p>

      <p>This four-page court document is an "Inventory and
         appraisement of the personal Estate of John W. Gantt decd in
         the County of Albemarle, taken on the 29th day of November
         1860 in pursuance of an order of Court hereunto annexed." The
         inventory, compiled by executor Henry Gantt and recorded by
         clerk of court Ira Garrett¹ on 4 February 1861,
         lists 57 slaves (including their names and ages ranging from
         one to seventy, whose individual value was between $70 and
         $1100), with furniture (including "Setting Room" and parlor
         furnishings), livestock (cows, hogs, horses, mules, oxen, and
         sheep), crops (corn, hay, tobacco, and wheat), farming
         equipment (cultivators, hoes, plows, reapers, scythes, and
         wheat fans), vehicles (buggy, carriage, carts, wagons), and 42
         shares of stock in the State of Virginia and the Scottsville
         Woolen Factory. Of the estate's $41,274.83 estimated value,
         Gantt's slaves were worth $33,720.</p>
      <p>¹Ira Garrett (1791-1870) served as Albemarle
            County's deputy sheriff (1815-1817), deputy county clerk
            (1818-1830), and county and circuit court clerk (1830-ca.
            1866). See accession number 11034.</p>
