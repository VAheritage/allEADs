      <p>
Perhaps the most telling comment about Carter Glass came from President Franklin Roosevelt, who called Glass an "Unreconstructed Rebel." Roosevelt meant exactly what the capital "R" on Rebel implies. As the Senate's last surviving member born in the antebellum South, Glass unapologetically fought to retain a society in which property-owning, white males sat at the top of the pyramid. In that regard, he was a man of his times.
</p>
      <p>
Carter Glass was born just as the year 1858 began, into a newspaper family that did not back away from a fight. Robert Henry Glass, Carter's father, owned the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Lynchburg Daily Republican,</title> the dominant Democratic newspaper in southwestern Virginia. In the summer of 1860, while Robert was away on business, his associate editor, George Hardwicke, killed a rival newspaperman who accused Glass of using his position as postmaster of Lynchburg to prevent the delivery of his competitor's papers. The elder Glass himself almost got into a duel, but his wife swore out warrants on both parties, and the matter was settled with canes rather than pistols. These lessons were not lost on Carter Glass, a scrapper in his youth who, as the eventual publisher of his own newspaper, almost came to a duel with a cross-town rival.
</p>
      <p>
During Reconstruction, there were few opportunities for the younger Glass to receive much formal education. At the age of 13, he was taken out of school and apprenticed as a printer with his father. From that point on, he learned on his own, reading Plato, Edmund Burke and Shakespeare, and his love of such intellectual pursuits never waned. Later, when he owned his own papers, he published articles about the true identity of Shakespeare, the meaning of the biblical stories as history and other such topics.
</p>
      <p>
Carter worked six years for his father, then moved with him to Petersburg, Va., to work on The Petersburg News. When the reporting job young Glass wanted did not materialize, he took a job as a clerk in the auditor's office of the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad back in Lynchburg. Robert accepted one of his son's political editorials, and soon after, 22-year-old Carter was offered a job as reporter on the Lynchburg News. Within a few years, he became the paper's editor and also served as clerk for the city of Lynchburg. With what looked to be a bright future, at the age of 28, Glass married his landlord's daughter, a school teacher from Lynchburg, and they eventually had four children.
</p>
      <p>
In 1888, with the help of some friends, he bought the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Lynchburg News,</title> and two years later, he purchased the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Daily Republican,</title> once owned by his father. In the meantime, the elder Glass returned to Lynchburg and took over the editorship of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Advance,</title> becoming Carter's rival. During a family feud, Robert stormed over to his son's offices and asked him where he had come up with the nonsense printed in the News. Carter pointed to a clipping his father had written earlier and said, "In my boyish pride of my father, I used to keep a scrapbook."
</p>
      <p>
Eventually, he bought the paper his father was editing and became the only publisher in town. Well respected both inside and outside his community, he used his influence to champion politicians who ran against what he felt were Democratic politicians promoting bad fiscal policy. Two important events occurred in 1896: his father died, and Carter went as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. There he heard William Jennings Bryan speak for free silver in his famous speech: "Thou shalt not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. Thou shalt not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold!" Glass would later repudiate Bryan's philosophy, but the adventure hooked him on politics.
As a politician, he was never in doubt
</p>
      <p>
In 1899, Glass was elected to the Virginia Senate. Two years later, as a delegate to the State Constitutional Convention, Glass became instrumental in pushing through the convention a proposal to proclaim a new state constitution outright without submitting it to anyone, thus disenfranchising those who had gained the right to vote under the 14th and 15th amendments. Almost four decades later, when President Franklin Roosevelt wanted to abolish poll taxes throughout the South, Glass defended the plank he himself had put into the Virginia Constitution and stated that "the President displays a very superficial knowledge of the subject."
</p>
      <p>
Even as he worked to disenfranchise certain segments of society, he had a soft spot in his heart for individual blacks. In the midst of the fight over the Federal Reserve Bill, Glass made a special trip home to Lynchburg to appear at the manslaughter trial of his black servant. He took the witness stand, "swore that William was the best Negro that ever lived in the United States" and pleaded to keep him from imprisonment. When William was fined $200, Congressman Glass reached into his pocket, pulled out a roll of bills, paid the fine, then rushed back to Washington, D.C.
</p>
      <p>
In 1902, at the age of 44, Glass was elected to the United States House of Representatives. To those who did not know him, he appeared sickly and frail. The 5-foot-4-inch Glass had dropped to 100 pounds and walked around on tiptoes to avoid jarring his sensitive stomach. This malady was not uncommon for Glass. Four years earlier, doctors warned him that his irregular eating habits and intense working habits had almost ruined his digestion, as well as caused a number of other bothersome ills. "Rest," his doctor ordered; but it was a futile request.
</p>
      <p>
His colleagues in the House soon learned that this little man was not to be taken lightly. Within two years, he was appointed to the Committee on Banking and Currency and threw himself into the study of finance just as heartily as he had earlier delved into questions about Shakespeare when he was a newspaper editor.
</p>
      <p>
The Banking Panic of 1907 put the Banking and Currency committee in the spotlight, and Glass found himself chairman when his friend Woodrow Wilson was elected president. Initial efforts at resolving the problems raised by the 1907 panic, though, were met with frustration. Essentially, legislators were concerned about two issues: a banking system that was prone to panics (1907's event was not rare), and a currency that was not responsive to changes in demand. On the makeup of a reserve system to address those problems, there was disagreement over the control of such an institution: Should private banks have control over the eventual Federal Reserve System, or should their input be confined to decentralized banks within the system?
</p>
      <p>
Carter Glass--who favored decentralized power--was particularly adamant on this question, and his role in developing the legislation is an example of how his Jeffersonian ideas of democracy, along with his tenacious spirit, helped shape one of the country's most important pieces of financial legislation. After working tirelessly on the subject for five years, the election of 1912 brought an opening: not only did it usher Wilson into the White House, but it also gave Glass' party control of both the House and Senate.
</p>
      <p>
Glass wasted no time. He began drafting legislation with Wilson before the newly elected president even took office, and by December of the following year, the Federal Reserve Act was passed and signed into law. Glass was thrilled: "The thing which had been vainly discussed and intermittently attempted for 20 years had finally been accomplished!"
</p>
      <p>
Essentially, in constructing the Federal Reserve Act with Wilson, Glass had repackaged the previous Republican administration's proposal, the economist Milton Friedman would later write, making it even more conservative. Instead of a centralized bank under private banker control, Glass, of course, wanted decentralized banks under private control. (The claim that the Federal Reserve Act was a modified form of the Aldrich plan was also made in Glass' day, and it was a notion he detested. In a 1922 speech before the Senate, Glass called the idea "a total misunderstanding," and said "no greater misconception was ever projected in this Senate Chamber ...") It was Wilson who suggested an altruistic board of governors appointed by the executive branch. Even though he may not have entirely liked that idea, Glass and his sharp tongue helped guarantee the bill's passage.
</p>
      <p>
During the coming European war, Glass supported Wilson and the struggle for a lasting peace. At the end of 1919, he was named Wilson's Secretary of the Treasury, the first cabinet officer from Virginia since the elder Glass' commander, John Floyd, was Secretary of War in Buchanan's administration. As such, Glass favored rebuilding Europe, including the defeated Germany, and pushed for American financial assistance. Although as head of the Treasury, Glass was in charge of enforcing prohibition laws, his greatest domestic concern had to do with the vast amount of borrowing for stock market speculation. Glass wanted the banks voluntarily to restrict their lending for stock purchases and warned about the consequences if nothing was done.
</p>
      <p>
Exactly one year after he took over at the Treasury, the popular Glass was appointed to the Senate in 1920 to succeed Thomas S. Martin of Virginia, who died in late 1919. Glass would remain a Virginia senator until his death.
</p>
      <p>
When Glass' predictions about the economy came true in 1929, he first went to work defending his original Federal Reserve legislation, then proceeded in 1931 to write a banking reform bill to provide the Federal Reserve Board with greater control over speculative credit. Thus began an important period wherein Glass and the rest of the nation, reeling from a series of financial panics and rampant bank closures, reconsidered what type of financial system was best for the country.
</p>
      <p>
Briefly, some of the laws enacted:
</p>
      <p>    * Glass-Steagall Act of 1932: The piece of legislation that keeps Glass' name in the news today, largely because of its provisions that separated commercial and investment banking; current reformers hope to mend that split. The Act also permitted the use of U.S. government securities as collateral for Federal Reserve notes.</p>
      <p>    * Banking Act of 1933: Established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-set the insurance level at $2,500 per depositor; placed control of open market operations under the Federal Reserve.</p>
      <p>    * Reconstruction Finance Corp. (1933): Permitted Federal Reserve to issue loans directly to businesses.</p>
      <p>    * Securities and Exchange Act: Provided for minimum margins on purchases of securities on credit.</p>
      <p>    * Banking Act of 1935: Created the Federal Open Market Committee; Federal Reserve Board becomes the Board of Governors, with terms set at 14 years; Secretary of the Treasury and Comptroller of the Currency were removed from the Board. 
</p>
      <p>
Glass was not always on the winning side of these new laws, including in his opposition to federal deposit insurance. As Friedman and Anna Schwartz tell it in their Monetary History of the United States: "[Glass] had opposed a similar provision at the time of the passage of the original Federal Reserve Act. Glass believed that the solution was reform of the practices of commercial banks and introduced several bills to that end. None received the support of the administration or of the Reserve System, and none was passed."
</p>
      <p>
In 1932, the political party he had been a member of for many years began to head down a path Glass did not care to take. Although he was said to like Franklin Roosevelt personally, he could not bring himself to trust anyone who sought public office with Roosevelt's vigor. Glass had also locked horns with Roosevelt when the latter was assistant secretary of the Navy and wanted to keep the Coast Guard under the Navy's jurisdiction after the end of World War I. Glass, as the head of Treasury, insisted it return to Treasury's control and won the point. Despite his misgivings, Glass got out of his sickbed to defend Roosevelt against Hoover's attacks. Roosevelt, in turn, offered Glass the Treasury. In poor health, Glass turned down the office, but he also knew that he and Roosevelt did not agree on fundamental economic issues. Glass tried to keep their disagreements private, but in a very short time, the Roosevelt administration would give him fits. The New Deal came along and took his mind off everything else, according to a flattering biography, even his prized Jersey cows at his home at Montview Farm, Va.
</p>
      <p>
Although in public Glass continued to support the Roosevelt administration, he openly fought some Roosevelt initiatives and worked tirelessly to fight against what he considered unconstitutional interference by the federal government in private affairs. But the fact that the New Deal carried all but two states in 1936 did not surprise Glass: "It is well nigh impossible to beat a five billion dollar campaign fund," he quipped.
</p>
      <p>
For the first time in years he did not participate in the construction of the party platform in 1936, and he spent the next four years working for a balanced budget and states' rights, usually behind the scenes. In 1937, however, he went on the radio to attack the White House's attempt to pack the Supreme Court. Glass won the battle. In 1940, as he had done four years earlier, he fought against the nomination of Roosevelt, but gave his support when the Democrat was nominated for a third term.
</p>
      <p>
Having been a widower for the previous three years, Glass remarried in 1940 at the age of 82. Although Glass' character had been "carved out of unblemished granite," according to Harry Byrd, the junior senator from his home state, the man himself had begun to allow the illnesses which had plagued him for most of his life to slow him down. For all intents and purposes, the father of the Federal Reserve System retired from public life within two years.
</p>
      <p>
Finally, at the age of 88, Glass died of congestive heart failure in his apartment at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. Out of respect for the senator from Virginia, the Senate suspended business and adjourned for the day. "A link with the Old South is broken in the passing of your distinguished husband," President Truman wrote to the second Mrs. Glass. "To the end he glorified in the title of 'Unreconstructed Rebel.'"

               Governor of the Federal Reserve Board : Letter from W.
               P. G. Harding on January 13, 1930, concerning the best
               method for getting bonds used as security for
               circulation out of national banks and into Federal
               Reserve banks, and opposing the suggestion by
               Representative Louis T. McFadden that the Comptroller of

               expense; Letter, February 2, 1929, from W. P. G.
               Harding, concerning the division of the surplus of the
               Federal Reserve banks, and mentioning that he would
               prefer to see reserve requirements against time deposits
               increase from 3% to 5%, but fears the resulting loss of
               membership would be too great to warrant such an
               increase in cost; Letter from W. P. G. Harding on
               January 13, 1930, stating that he finds the McFadden
               Bill unacceptable, because of the supervisory element
               involved and the requirement that member banks pay the
               expenses of examinations. It is suggested that the
               excess profits of a reserve bank be more equitably
               distributed; Correspondence with Harding, concerning a
               speech to a group of New England bankers, which Carter

               retiring national bank notes from circulation; Letter

               Glass to Harding on March 27, 1926, expressing favor for

               the level of interest rates and prices; Note of a
               personal nature from W. P. G. Harding on March 26, 1926,

               for revision of the McFadden Bill to include
               indeterminate charters for Federal Reserve banks and
               listing the persons and groups, including Irving Fisher,
               who oppose the charter amendment offered by Carter
               Glass, and the reasons for their opposition; Letter of
               December 10, 1925, from W. P. G. Harding, expressing

               to W. P. G. Harding on October 8, 1927, noting that he

               Norris, on an unspecified matter; Letter, October 5,
               1927, from W. P. G. Harding pertaining to a letter from
               Carter Glass to Norris, concerning the foreign
               transactions of the New York Federal Reserve bank,
               expressing the opinion that the Federal Reserve Act has
               not been violated, but that it would be better for
               certain of the larger member banks to carry on business
               with foreign banks with the support of the Federal
               Reserve bank; Letter from Harding to Carter Glass on
               September 22, 1927, expressing great pleasure at the
               appointment of Roy A. Young, who is said to favor the

               Federal Reserve Board; Copy of a letter sent to W. P. G.
               Harding on October 27, 1925, complimenting him on the

               length on the incapacity evidenced by Robert L. Owen in
               his handling of the Federal Reserve legislation, states
               that Senator Robert L. Owen was "a positive obstruction
               to the preparation of the bill," and further admits the
               mistake of the House conferees in placing the
               Comptroller of the Currency upon the Federal Reserve
               Board, since the men who have filled this office had
               been of such uniformly poor character; Telegram from W.
               P. G. Harding on January 28, 1925, stating that, while
               national bank standards should not be lowered, these
               banks should be able to compete with the state banks
               with respect to the establishment of branches; Letter of
               November 9, 1925, from Harding, responding to a query by
               Carter Glass to say that, although he does not possess
               certain incriminating telegrams, sent by Senator Robert
               L. Owen in connection with foreign exchange speculation
               during a period of inflation, he thinks copies can be
               found at the Federal Reserve Board and that Fred I. Kent
               possibly has the originals; Letter from Carter Glass to
               W. P. G. Harding on October 29, 1923, stating that he
               will probably not accept speaking engagements to oppose
               those, including Congressman Tom Heflin, who wanted to
               ruin the system, whereby checks were cleared at or near
               par; Letter, October 23, 1923, W. P. G. Harding
               suggesting that Carter Glass actively oppose those
               persons who sought to destroy the check collection
               system; Letter of October 8, 1923, W. P. G. Harding to
               Carter Glass, enclosing a copy of a letter from Harding
               to Edmund Platt, in which opinions of Harding are
               rendered against interference by the Federal Reserve
               Board with the situation with respect to branch banking,
               created by the state laws of California, and in favor of
               the Dallas Federal Reserve bank engaging in open market
               transactions, involving bill of lading drafts endorsed
               by non-member banks; Carter Glass responds on October
               10, 1923, that he does not feel that the Board has any
               power to limit the number of branches operated by state
               banks, which also belong to the Federal Reserve System;
               Letter from W. P. G. Harding on January 29, 1923,
               stating that there is some reason for doubt as to the
               future of the Federal Reserve System, largely because of
               the policies and administrative powers which may be
               employed by those in positions of responsibility.
               Harding expresses the opinion that, given a continuation
               of the conservative lending policies of the Board, wise
               management of the Federal Reserve banks offers solution
               to the problems; Personal letter from W. P. G. Harding
               on January 29, 1923, opposing Senator Tom Heflin's
               proposed amendment to the Federal Reserve Act, whereby
               progressive rates of interest would not be charged by
               Federal Reserve banks. Harding fears that the next move
               by Tom Heflin would be to attempt to place an upper
               limit on the discount rate through legislative action;
               Letter from Carter Glass on January 24, 1923,
               congratulating W. P. G. Harding on becoming governor of
               the Boston Federal Reserve bank, stating that it was a
               pity that a President had not been elected, who would
               have been ready to protect the banking system of the
               country from political attacks, and suggesting that,
               given the recent appointments, it would be impossible
               for the system to remain intact; Letter of October 18,
               1922, Carter Glass to George W. Detrick of Hopwell,
               Virginia, stating that he had done nothing about getting
               W. P. G. Harding reappointed as governor of the Federal
               Reserve Board, largely because he felt that his opinion
               carried no weight with the President, although he would
               prefer to see Harding remain at the job; Handwritten
               note from W. P. G. Harding to Carter Glass on September
               2, 1922, stating that he has learned that the President
               refuses to place Harding's name in nomination for
               reappointment to the Board, because of his fear that
               Senator Tom Heflin will carry out his threat to invoke
               senatorial courtesy; Copy of a newspaper article
               praising Carter Glass for a speech in behalf of the
               Federal Reserve System is sent to him by Harding;
               Correspondence pertaining to the attacks by Senator Tom
               Heflin on the Federal Reserve bank; Letters relating to
               par clearance of checks, including a report by Charles
               A. Peple, deputy governor of the Richmond Federal
               reserve bank, on a controversial question, involving the
               collection system; Several complimentary letters from
               Carter Glass to W. P. G. Harding upon important
               occasions in the career of the governor; Newspaper

               policies of the Federal Reserve System; Memorandum on
               November 17, 1919, from W. P. G. Harding to Senator
               Robert L. Owen, relating to speculative activities by
               the Federal Reserve banks; Response by Carter Glass to
               Harding's statement dispatched to Senator Robert L.
               Owen.</p>
          <p>B. Correspondence with Charles S. Hamlin : Letter,
               Carter Glass to Charles S. Hamlin on December 18, 1934,
               concerning the impropriety of the Federal Reserve Board,
               the Insurance of Deposits Corporation, or any
               institution, other than Congress, placing limits on the
               rate of interest charged on time deposits by state
               banks, which were not members of the Federal Reserve
               System; Copy of a November 7, 1929, letter from Carter
               Glass to W. P. G. Harding, discussing the distribution
               of a greater portion of the earnings of the Federal
               Reserve System to the member banks, rather that the
               government, as an incentive to membership in the System,
               and setting forth the desirability of preventing stack
               gambling through punitive legislation; Note from
               Governor Eugene Meyer, of the Federal Reserve Board, on
               December 6, 1932, accompanying a statement to the effect

               establish a unified commercial banking system under
               national supervision;" Letter, Charles S. Hamlin to
               Carter Glass, June 7, 1935, quoting an entry in his
               diary, expressing the opinion that Carter Glass was in a
               position to strengthen the Federal Reserve Board and to
               make it a legally independent body, if he would work to
               have the Federal Reserve Act amended in the manner
               proposed at that time. Charles S. Hamlin offers to
               discuss this matter at the convenience of Carter Glass;
               Letter from Carter Glass to Secretary of the Interior,
               Harold L. Ickes, on March 31, 1935, defending certain
               government loans merely as a means of increasing
               employment, and not, according to the interpretation of
               Harold L. Ickes, as a method of revising the social
               structure. The question of whether projects are to
               involve work relief, or mere relief, is part of the
               discussion; Letter from Charles S. Hamlin to Carter
               Glass on January 22, 1926, listing the names of some men

               letters involving Carter Glass and Josephus Daniels,
               North Carolina newspaper editor, which reflect
               unfavorably on Hoover; Note from President Herbert
               Hoover to Carter Glass on December 2, 1931, enclosing an
               opinion, submitted to him by the Attorney General,
               stating that Congressional power to regulate interstate
               commerce did not include the power to regulate
               commercial banking. Thus, commercial banks could not be
               compelled to become members of the Federal Reserve
               System.</p>
          <p>G. Correspondence with Colonel E. M. House :
               Correspondence during December 15, 1919, between Carter
               Glass and E. M. House, concerning a successor for Carter
               Glass as Secretary of the Treasury. Carter Glass
               recommends Russell C. Leffingwell, citing his stand in
               opposition to the policies of Benjamin Strong and the
               New York Federal Reserve bank officials. House responds
               that he had favored Roper, of the Internal Revenue
               Bureau, but was inclined to concur in the opinion of
               Carter Glass that Leffingwell would be the best person
               for the job; Copy of a letter of December 11, 1919, from
               Carter Glass to William G. McAdoo, discussing possible
               successors at the Treasury Department, suggesting that
               it would be unwise to remove Roper from his place at the
               Internal Revenue Bureau, looking upon appointment of
               Williams with favor, except that Carter Glass feels that
               a southerner should be appointed, Charles Hamlin is
               considered an excellent choice, except for the
               likelihood of his surrendering to outside influences,
               many reasons are offered in favor of Russell C.
               Leffingwell; Telegram dated September 18, 1913, from E.

               Woodrow Wilson from Carter Glass on February 26, 1919,

               respect to the resulting controversies.</p>
          <p>Q. Several relatively lengthy letters, Carter Glass
               to Walter Lippmann during 1933, concerning the National
               Recovery Act and the effect on the reserve position of
               the Federal Reserve System as a result of either a
               devaluation of the dollar or the confiscation by the
               government of the gold holdings of the banks.</p>
          <p>R. Correspondence with Russell C. Leffingwell :
               Letters relating to the responsibility of the Federal
               Reserve System for the depression and the proposed
               course of action for the System as of July, 1933. Carter
               Glass and Leffingwell disagree upon the points discussed
               in these letters. Carter Glass criticizes the Federal
               Reserve policy of purchasing government securities in a
               futile attempt to restore the credit structure of the
               country, while Leffingwell states that monetary
               management offers the solution to economic recovery and
               that the return to a gold standard should await such
               recovery; Statements by Russell C. Leffingwell
               attempting to explain the loss of export trade by the
               United States; Letter of July 12, 1933, Carter Glass to
               Russell C. Leffingwell stating that three provisions of
               the Carter Glass bill had been included "upon urgent
               Administration request," but the although having
               accepted the suggestions of the President, Carter Glass
               had not changed his own views, which he had previously
               expressed to Leffingwell, devotes a lengthy paragraph to
               criticizing Leffingwell for his apparent acceptance of
               certain of the schemes put into effect during the
               Roosevelt administration, refers particularly to the
               gold embargo and the closing of banks.</p>
          <p>S. Correspondence with Norman H. Davis during
               January, 1927, admitting that a speech, made by Elihu
               Root in defense of the League of Nations, was quite
               worthy of praise, but stating that the time to have made
               such remarks was during the fight in the Senate to bring
               the United States into the League.</p>

          <p>V. Copy of a Senate speech, made by Carter Glass on
               February 11, 1930, opposing the confirmation of Charles
               Evans Hughes as a member of the Supreme Court. One of
               the primary reasons for the opposition of Carter Glass
               to Hughes was his decision in the Shreveport case, on
               the basis of which states lost all vestige of control
               over inter-state commerce.</p>

               both Eugene and Mrs. Meyer; Statement on March 14, 1933,
               by Eugene Meyer saying that it was not wise of the

               make direct loans to state banks and trust companies;
               Copy of a January 9, 1933, statement by the board,

               made to member banks which did not possess satisfactory
               eligible paper, on the basis of which credit might be
               extended. The board went further, to accept the
               recommendation of the Federal Advisory Council, the
               Federal Reserve agents, and the governors of the Federal
               Reserve banks, that the reserve banks retain the
               privilege of pledging direct obligations of the United
               States as collateral security for Federal Reserve notes;
               Statement of November 25, 1932, from Eugene Meyer,
               stating that an opinion from the legal advisor to the
               board is forthcoming, which will render the opinion that
               Congress has the power to create a unified banking
               system; Brief memoranda from the Federal Reserve Board,
               March 29, 1932, concerning the amount of investment
               securities "of any one obligor" which might be held by

          <p>G. Correspondence with George J. Seay, governor of
               the Richmond Federal Reserve bank : Letter from George
               J. Seay, May 16, 1932, approving the Carter Glass bill
               then under consideration, opposing the Goldsborough
               bill, and opposing the guarantee of bank deposits.
               Carter Glass says that some type of deposit guarantee is
               inevitable, so that he hopes to have accepted the idea
               of forming a liquidating corporation; Letter, April 14,
               1930, Carter Glass states that his banking bill will
               contain provisions for branch banking and a more equal
               distribution of the earnings of the Federal Reserve
               System. Seay sent statistics showing the loss of member
               banks as a result of the prohibition against branches;
               Copy of a statement showing bank earnings, sent by Seay;
               Letter in which George Seay notes agreement between
               himself and Benjamin M. Anderson, economist of the Chase
               National Bank of New York; Letter from George Seay,
               March 15, 1928, explaining his reasons for feeling the
               Federal Reserve System had created too much credit. The
               expansion of time deposits had brought a low ratio of
               required reserves and the excess credit was finding its
               way into the security markets, said Seay. Seay disagreed
               with O. M. W. Sprague, who said that the excess credit
               in circulation arose from the investment of capital
               savings, rather than from Federal Reserve policy; Paper
               by George J. Seay, "Illustrating the Expanded Condition
               of Bank Credit;" Carter Glass, October 20, 1927,
               thanking George Seay for advising him upon the decision
               of the Federal Reserve Board on the Chicago discount
               rate case. Seay felt that the Board should continue to
               exercise powers of review over discount rate policy, but
               should not be permitted to dictate a uniform discount
               rate for all the banks; Letter from George J. Seay,
               August 12, 1927, advising against lowering the discount
               rate; Copy of an article from the

               "Centralizing Federal Reserve Control," sent to Carter
               Glass by George Seay on April 12, 1927, Seay compliments
               Carter Glass on his own articles, designed to place
               credit for Federal Reserve legislation where it was due.
               In warning Carter Glass about renewed attempts to
               centralize the Federal Reserve System by some
               unrecognized individuals, Seay points out the extreme
               importance of preserving the regional aspect of the
               system; Copy of several amendments to the Federal
               Reserve Act aimed at stabilizing the general price
               level, forwarded by George J. Seay, who had received his
               copy from James. G. Strong, who planned to introduce the
               amendments in the House; Excellent statement by George
               Seay on June 1, 1926, criticizing the amendments
               proposed by Representative Strong. Seay doubts the
               wisdom of further attempts by any central body to
               control credit and does not feel that stabilized prices
               represent an appropriate goal; Brief letter from George
               Seay to John M. Miller, a Richmond, Virginia banker,
               criticizing the McFadden branch banking bill,
               particularly with respect to loans; Note from Carter
               Glass to Seay on April 20, 1929, expressing little
               respect for the officials of the American Bankers
               Association, who had been willing to sacrifice
               indeterminate charters for the Federal Reserve banks, if
               they could get the Hull amendments accepted; Seay states
               in a letter of April 17, 1926, that he does not feel
               that it is necessary to do away with branch banking;

               prepared on September 15, 1925, reviewing the problem

               obtained a copy of the report of the Pujo Committee;
               Figures sent by George J. Seay on February 15, 1924,
               purport to show the position of banks at that time,
               compared to what their position might have been, if the

               visit to Lynchburg, in September, 1921, about Carter

               Reconstruction Finance Corporation, to the President for
               a vacant position on the Federal Reserve Board. Carter
               Glass responds that he has already submitted the name of
               Bob Stewart, of Oklahoma, for the position.</p>

               notebook kept by Carter Glass during June, 1919,
               concerning the possibility of a third term for President

               for introduction before the close of the extraordinary
               session. The President says, "I have had some very
               interesting conferences about the banking and currency
               question recently which make it very desirable that I
               should see you again for a further talk"; January 1,
               1913, President Wilson expressing a desire to talk with
               Carter Glass shortly after Royal Meeker has presented

               Board, so as to permit banker representation on the
               board. Carter Glass refers to the agreement of Robert J.
               Bulkley, "a strong man of the committee with whom we
               must reckon," an cites the opinion of Bulkley that

               the Senate, offered by Governor Davis of Virginia, but

               Comptroller of the Currency, and proposing that Jouett
               Shouse succeed Love as Assistant Secretary of the

               President Wilson, having recently spoken with E. D.
               Hulbert, asks that Carter Glass and Senator Robert L.
               Owen see what could be done about removing the
               restriction, inadvertently placed in the currency bill,

               for a period of three years; Note from Woodrow Wilson on
               June 20, 1913, thanking Carter Glass for permitting him
               to see a telegram from E. D. Hulbert, and expressing the

               Carter Glass to President Wilson on June 16, 1922,
               criticizing the plan, intimated by Frank A. Vanderlip,

               Carter Glass considers impractical and unnecessary;
               Numerous other letters touching upon many subjects.</p>
          <p>B. Correspondence with Clifton A. Woodrum,
               Congressman from Virginia : Recommendation for assuring

               of the newspaper series, written by Carter Glass in
               1926. Carter Glass tells Mrs. Wilson that subsequent
               installments will relate to the diary of Colonel House
               and the method of obtaining the Federal Reserve
               legislation; In a letter, July 14, 1926, Carter Glass
               tells Mrs. Wilson that her influence was, to some
               degree, responsible for the rapid acceptance of Charles
               S. Hamlin as a member of the Federal Reserve Board.
               Carter Glass states that this appointment was "only
               thing I have ventured to ask of the present

          <p>E. Correspondence with Paul M. Warburg : Highly
               complimentary letter to Carter Glass from John
               Wanamaker; Letter, September 14, 1926, Paul M. Warburg
               expressing the hope that the extension of the charter of
               the Federal Reserve banks would not be lost in favor of
               the Hull amendments. Warburg asks that Carter Glass take
               the opportunity, afforded by his writing a book about
               the Federal Reserve legislation, to correct some of the
               misrepresentations contained in the book by H. Parker
               Willis. Paul M. Warburg states that he does not seek
               credit for his work in connection with the legislation,
               but only desires that an account of the history of the
               measure be presented; In a letter to Paul M. Warburg on
               October 18, 1926, Carter Glass notes with pleasure the
               reversal of position by the American Bankers Association
               on the proposed Hull amendments to the McFadden Bill.
               Carter Glass refuses to concur in the condemnation by
               Paul M. Warburg of the H. Parker Willis book, but does
               feel that certain of the personal attacks, made by H.
               Parker Willis, were unwarranted. Carter Glass points out
               that, by his connection with Dr. Edwin R. Seligman, Paul
               M. Warburg has made himself vulnerable to criticism.
               Carter Glass feels that he has been as truthful with
               respect the Paul M. Warburg in his book as he had been
               regarding Colonel House and Professor Seymour; Letter of
               April 25, 1930, from Paul M. Warburg, informing Carter
               Glass that he has found it necessary to submit for
               public consideration a refutation of certain statements
               made by Carter Glass and a correction of the numerous
               misstatements indulged by H. Parker Willis. Warburg
               expresses continued friendship for Carter Glass and
               hopes that the public controversy the history of the
               System quickly dies down, so that attention can be
               confined to the more important problems, involving
               saving the System from destruction; Correspondence with
               Paul M. Warburg in 1929, concerning permission to
               include two letters, one from Carter Glass to Senator
               Robert L. Owen and the other from Carter Glass to Paul
               M. Warburg, in the book which Paul M. Warburg was about
               to have published; Letter from Carter Glass to H. Parker
               Willis, marked strictly confidential and dated December
               31, 1926. Carter Glass wants to know, whether H. Parker
               Willis knows anything about the Paul M. Warburg plan for
               a "Board of Regents," to which Paul M. Warburg has
               ascribed the origin of the idea for the Federal Reserve
               Board. Carter Glass continues to defend his position
               with respect to the origin of this phase of the law,
               tracing it to President Wilson. Paul M. Warburg feels
               that Wilson got the idea from him through Colonel House
               and Morgenthau. Carter Glass reproduces a letter from
               himself to Paul M. Warburg on this subject;
               Correspondence relating to the position taken by Carter
               Glass when the Senate was conducting investigations,
               under the leadership of Gerald P. Nye, into the part
               played by Woodrow Wilson in getting the United States
               into World War I. Carter Glass defended President

               urging that bank funds invested in the Federal Reserve

               effecting a change of this nature are slim. Robert D.
               Kent also expresses the opinion that the proposed system
               is unwise in that it throws the new banks into
               competition with the former organization, which Kent
               considered admirably suited to its task; Proposal by
               Senator Pointdexter, looking toward correcting

               answer to a letter, Carter Glass states, August 15,
               1913, that he made a speech on the Currency Bill before
               the Democratic caucus, which was never published in any
               form; Carter Glass to J. H. Tregoe, August 12, 1913,
               that he expected the Currency Bill to survive the caucus

               although he feared it was too late to make any changes
               at that point, because of the previous action on the

               management of reserve banks to the House provisions for
               banker management. Replies are varied, but the consensus
               of opinion seems to be that, if the banks own the stock,
               they should also be in control, and if they do not own

               positions on the Federal Reserve Board, who would force
               the system along central banking lines. H. Parker Willis
               suggests that men like Paul M. Warburg and Charles A.
               Conant be kept off the Board. He thinks it would be
               good, if Carter Glass would accept a position on the
               Board, as suggested by Secretary William G. McAdoo. H.
               Parker Willis felt that certain individuals had changed
               their minds since the passing of the act and that they
               would have to be dealt with carefully. Wall Street
               interests were still to be feared, said H. Parker
               Willis, who was also of the opinion that amendments to

               lead to a whole series of further amendments; Letter of
               January 5, 1914, from A. E. Walker, asking whether State

               Reserve System, can receive accommodation from national
               banks; Lengthy discussion of the Currency Bill by Adam

               Carter Glass speak before the Economic Club of New York;
               In a letter to J. H. Johnson on October 28, 1913, Carter
               Glass states that, although everything is perfect in
               connection with the savings bank provisions of the
               Currency Bill, he feels that no change is necessary;
               Magazine cites Robert W. Babson and A. Piatt Andrew as
               considering the Owen-Glass bill to be inflationary and
               requests comment from Carter Glass; Three changes in the
               Owen-Glass bill are suggested by the Utica, New York,
               Association of Credit Men : redemption of notes only in
               gold, reduction of the number of Federal Reserve banks,
               and representation of the number of Federal Reserve
               banks on the Federal Reserve Board or an increase in the
               powers of the Advisory Board; Suggestions of other

               reserve banks; Letter, November 3, 1913, from the
               secretary of the Economic Club of New York, stating that
               not everyone in the group favors the Vanderlip proposal
               for a central bank, so that his audience will not be
               hostile to the Currency Bill; In writing to J. F.
               Fulton, November 24, 1913, Carter Glass states that the
               favor of the business interests for the Currency Bill is
               appreciated, especially in view of the opposition of the
               bankers to the measure; Telegram from E. D. Hulbert,

               amendments relating to the regional aspect of the new
               system, punishment for allowing reserves to fall below a
               certain minimum, and the extent to which the government
               should control the system; Letter, November 26, 1913,
               from Representative Howard Sutherland, asking whether
               some remedy can be found for the criticisms from country

          <p>A. Telegram from George M. Reynolds on September 21,
               1914, opposing the attempt to incorporate a provision
               against interlocking bank directorates in the Clayton

               answers that questions of tax rates on notes are

               C. Gregory; Reply, May 19, 1914, by Carter Glass to a
               letter from M. Brayton Graff, refusing a request to
               consider a bill not officially introduced in the House,
               unless Henry would agree to allow the Banking and

               Carter Glass stating his view of the problem in terms of
               "dilution of bank reserves and resultant inflation."
               Glass does not support the thinking of Paul M. Warburg

               Warburg's opinion that the Federal Reserve bank of the
               district should have control over the reserve fund, and

          <p>A. Miscellaneous correspondence: Carter Glass cites
               the probable unconstitutionality of omitting a clause
               from that section of the Federal Reserve Act enabling
               national banks to carry out fiduciary functions; Carter
               Glass answers a query by stating that liberty bonds in

               letters expressing desire to have the law amended, so

               Treasury, John Skelton Williams, Comptroller of the

               John H. Small, favoring the discontinuance of the
               necessity for member banks of the Federal Reserve System
               to pay a stamp tax on obligations secured by Liberty
               Bonds. Carter Glass concurs; Letter from a Roanoke,
               Virginia, banker, April 15, 1918, requesting to be
               informed when Congress accepts a pending measure

               income and excess profits taxes with government
               depositaries; Letter to the editor of the

               showing the unconstitutionality of the Pittman Bill,
               relating to the coinage of silver, sent to Carter Glass
               by the writer, James C. Hallock, 1918 April 20; In
               response to a letter from Oliver J. Sands, concerning a
               bill to prevent national banks from charging a bill to
               prevent national banks from charging usurious rates of
               interest, Carter Glass states that he would like to see
               national banks charge interest rates that would
               correspond in direction of movement to the rediscount
               rate set by the Federal Reserve System; Letter,
               September 1, 1917, from John V. Farwell, asking that the
               proposed excess profits tax be made effective only after
               eight percent had been earned on invested capital;
               Letter from a hotel operator in Georgia, proposing that

               Answers by Carter Glass to questions concerning issuance
               of greenbacks in 1917, the difficulty of obtaining loans

               in banking laws; Letter from a Lynchburg, Virginia,
               banker, February 23, 1918, describing certain
               transactions between his bank and the Federal Reserve
               Bank at Richmond, which he did not feel should be
               subject to taxation; Letter, April 18, 1918, from R. L.
               Van Zandt, governor of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank,
               suggesting changes in the proposed amendments to the
               Federal Reserve Act. Carter Glass accepts the
               suggestions, but fears that it is too late to have them
               included in the pending measure; Letters from special
               interest groups, opposing the exaction of taxes on
               excess profits, draw an unencouraging answer from Carter
               Glass; Carter Glass expresses approval of the ideas,

               profits. Much of the correspondence is with those who
               have special interests which they desire to protect. The
               anticipated result of the imposition of the proposed
               taxes is the failure of many concerns; Correspondence
               concerning extending the right to vote to women; Letter
               from the Corn Exchange National Bank, favoring the
               granting of permission to the national banks to

               times the capital and surplus accounts of the bank would

               that the terms of the next issue of Treasury
               certificates be published as early as possible, so that

               holdings; Statement of approval from the Merchants
               Association of New York for bills relating to branch

               denominations; Letter stating that the import duties to

               Reserve Act, proposed by Senator Calder, and expressing

               the Seattle area; Letter from G. J. Seay of the Richmond
               Federal Reserve Bank in which he presents arguments to
               Carter Glass favoring a proposed amendment to the

               Federal Reserve notes against paper and gold, the
               minimum proportion of gold being 40 percent, and this

               protests to their Congress men so that the proposed
               "Kitchin bill" would be defeated, statin that the bill
               would restore the "old system of charges" on collecting
               checks, and noting that country bankers are flooding

               found to lighten the tax burden on manufacturers. Carter

               <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New York World</title>, February
               8, 1918, refuting the claim by Senator Gilbert M.
               Hitchcock that the Federal Reserve Act was largely the

               the bill supported by Carter Glass; Letter from William
               C. Ward, October 5, 1917, stating that several of the
               reasons for the Guarantee Trust Company joining the
               Federal Reserve System were to take advantage of the
               opportunity to rediscount paper and to better their
               position in international finance; Letter from H. Parker
               Willis, secretary of the Federal Reserve Board, to
               Carter Glass, enclosing copies of amendments to the

               also including several committee reports; Correspondence
               during 1918, regarding the possible effects of the
               government taking over the railroads; Lengthy,
               handwritten letter to Carter Glass from H. Parker
               Willis, July 28, 1918, apprising Carter Glass of the
               status of the various members of the Federal Reserve
               Board, as to availability to carry on their functions
               and setting forth his own plans for terminating his work
               as secretary of the Board. A majority of the Board
               members were either out of town, too busy with other
               duties, or leaving their positions entirely. No work was
               being accomplished and few plans could be made until
               Congress, then in session but not willing to consider
               any important legislative matters, made appointments
               which would fill the vacancies on the Board. H. Parker
               Willis sees the period as the end of the initial stage
               of the history of the Federal Reserve System. He plans
               to continue his association with the System, but in an
               advisory capacity from New York; Personal letter to
               Carter Glass from H. Parker Willis, June 25, 1918,
               noting the resignation of Frederick A. Delano and asking
               that Carter Glass suggest to the President that H.
               Parker Willis be appointed to the vacant position on the
               Federal Reserve Board, if this action were considered
               desirable by Carter Glass. H. Parker Willis states that
               his reason for making such a suggestion is to insure
               that a person who understands the problems of the Board
               is appointed to the position. He says that he will take
               no other action on this proposition; Copy of a letter
               written by Carter Glass on June 27, 1918, to Woodrow
               Wilson, recommending that H. Parker Willis be appointed
               to the Federal Reserve Board in the place of Frederick
               A. Delano, and giving his qualifications for the job;

               1918, expressing interest in a letter sent to him by
               Carter Glass and stating that he hoped to learn that a
               favorable decision had been made in the matter;
               Correspondence and pamphlets, 1918, regarding priority
               in production of goods; Telegram from F. K. Wyncott, of
               Portsmouth, Virginia, stating simply that McAdoo should
               succeed Wilson; Telegram from Carter Glass to Paul M.
               Warburg, undated, saying in part, "Am deeply
               disappointed at turn of events, which is to be deplored.
               Will write when I get your address."</p>

               the Comptroller of the Currency prohibiting the
               maintaining of railroad accounts with certain trust
               companies; Letter from Senator Edward S. Johnson on
               August 6, 1919, accompanying a copy of a letter sent to
               President Wilson stating that the way to solve the
               problem of the high cost of necessities was to limit the
               percent of profits in the same manner that the rate of
               interest charged by banks was limited; Copy of a letter
               from Carter Glass to Arthur A. Jones written on August
               11, 1919, in which the authorship of the Federal Reserve
               Act is discussed. Carter Glass denies the statement by
               Jones that Woodrow Wilson was the author of the measure,
               even though the backing of E. D. Hulbert had been cited
               as the foundation for the statement. Carter Glass sent a
               copy of his speeches before the House of Representatives
               on September 10 and 13, 1913, with the passages marked
               which answered the question. He also stated that it
               could be proven that, although attempts were made, the
               Senate did not succeed in forcing any major changes in
               the House bill; Letter and note mentioning the name of
               W. A. Julian. The letter is from Senator Atlee Pomerene;

               from the Viewpoint of an Ineligible Non-Member," at a
               convention of the American Bankers Association. Carter
               Glass responds that he disagrees with what Kent has to
               say and that he does not feel that the office of the
               Comptroller of the Currency should be merged with the
               Federal Reserve Board. A copy of the speech by Kent is

          <p>A. Correspondence, March, 1922, relating to an
               amendment to the Federal Reserve Act, suggested by
               Senator McKellar, whereby the paper of cotton factors
               would be eligible for rediscount. Carter Glass responds
               that he voted for this amendment, since the restrictions
               set forth by the Federal Reserve Board seemed to justify
               an affirmative vote, but that the measure had been
               defeated; Correspondence regarding a Federal charter for

               of the Federal Reserve Board and, as such, be entitled
               to receive compensation, despite the fact that the

               Currency: Letter from Carter Glass, January 25, 1922, in
               which he states that in his first draft of the Federal
               Reserve Act he provided that the Secretary of
               Agriculture should be an ex-officio member of the
               Federal Reserve Board and discusses the type of men who
               should be members; Letter, January 3, 1922, in which he
               expresses the belief that the Federal Reserve System has
               been extravagant in its building program and too liberal
               in the matter of officers' salaries and mentions
               agricultural interests and the Federal Reserve System;
               Letter, January 31, 1922, claiming that Carter Glass
               heard Senator Tom Heflin rehearsing a speech attacking
               the Federal Reserve System which had bee written by John
               Skelton Williams and answering Williams' objection to a
               speech by Carter Glass in defense of the Federal Reserve
               System; Letter, February 6, 1922 discussing
               disagreements with John Skelton Williams and containing
               a statement by Carter Glass that he was warned by Tom
               Heflin not to speak in defense of the Federal Reserve
               System in the Senate. Carter Glass was told that if he
               spoke in defense of the system, the paternity of the
               bill would be ascribed to a German economist rather than
               to Carter Glass; Several letters from John Skelton

               a federal judgeship, who has a conflict with Civil
               Service officials. Carter Glass expresses the opinion in

               the Comptroller of the Currency, to discuss bank holding
               companies, and branch banking; Carter Glass' answer,
               offering to present legislation, prepared by Morgenthau,
               on the subject of holding companies, was not sent, since
               Carter Glass went to the meeting in person. Carter Glass
               states that action on his previous bill, concerning bank
               holding companies, was withheld at the request of

               for an interview on the subject of the desirability of a
               third term for Franklin D. Roosevelt, largely because he
               gets too mad to be gentlemanly.</p>

               March 13, 1939, expressing the hope that the Federal

          <p>A. Miscellaneous legislation, 1939: Carter Glass
               responds to a letter requesting his opinion of the
               Wagner Act by stating, "I think the National Labor

               statute books."; Letter requesting Carter Glass to
               oppose the amendment, proposed by Senator King, to the

               Carter Glass opposed the farm bill, but gauged the

               labeled farm relief would be accepted: Letter proposing

               Smoot-Hawley tariff schedule and rewriting existing
               reciprocal trade treaties.</p>

               restoration of confidence in the government as the
               solution to the problem of depression, rather than pump
               priming.</p>

               Governors; Letter from Senator Harry F. Byrd, September
               21, 1937, expressing the opinion that opposition is
               developing toward a particular person, because "he has
               become obsessed with the mania for Franklin D. Roosevelt
               "; Letter to Bernard M. Baruch from Senator Carter Glass
               when Bernard M. Baruch was ill; Letter from I. C.
               Blandy, December 7, 1936, urging Carter Glass to act as
               an independent, especially in view of the dictatorial
               powers of the President over the Treasury and the
               Federal Reserve Board; Upon being asked to advise a
               newly qualified voter as to parties, Carter Glass
               replies that neither party can be highly recommended to
               an intelligent person, but that he adheres to the
               Democratic party, hoping that someday it will return to
               Jeffersonian principles; Letter questioning continued
               need for silver purchase policy; Letter, October 6,
               1936, from Edwin W. Kemmerer to Carter Glass, with four
               enclosures. Edwin W. Kemmerer deals with such subjects
               as inflation, prices, the interest rate, and
               international finance. The enclosures include articles
               prepared by Edwin W. Kemmerer; Edwin W. Kemmerer wrote
               to Carter Glass, October 3, 1936, asking Carter Glass to
               repeat a statement about the effects of a decline in the
               prince of government bonds. Carter Glass states that a
               decline in values would be disastrous to a large
               majority of banks, since they hold so many government
               securities. Policies of the Reconstruction Finance
               Corporation have kept banks solvent, says Carter Glass,
               rather than those of the Federal Deposit Insurance
               Corporation. Carter Glass feels that an "explosion" is
               almost inevitable; Telegrams concerning a statement of
               distrust for the New Deal, made by Carter Glass. Carter
               Glass responds that he will continue to vote against any
               New Deal proposals, which he considers "unsound or
               unconstitutional"; Telegram from Morgenthau, Secretary
               of the Treasury, December 8, 1936, requesting that
               Carter Glass arrange a time to discuss "financial
               legislation" with him; In answer to a letter, Carter
               Glass states that he did not think Hugo Black should
               have been appointed to the Supreme Court, but saw no
               practical way that the Senate could challenge the
               appointment, having once given confirmation; In making
               critical remarks in connection with a biography of his
               life by James E. Palmer, Carter Glass states that he had
               "denounced Garrison as an imposter, who did not
               contribute a line nor an idea to the Federal Reserve
               Act." (Garrison wrote the book about Franklin D.
               Roosevelt, Wilson, et. al.); Letter, July 30, 1937, from
               Edmund Platt, former member of the Federal Reserve
               Board, expressing sincere regret at the death of H.
               Parker Willis. Edmund Platt recalls the strained
               relations between H. Parker Willis and most of the
               members of the Board, resulting from H. Parker Willis '
               criticisms of low interest rates and easy money
               policies. Edmund Platt admits the validity of H. Parker
               Willis ' statements, but lays the blame to appointees to
               the Board by President Harding; Letter from Edmund
               Platt, October 23, 1936, enclosing an article on
               business recovery and the gold standard by Rufus S.
               Tucker, a mutual friend of he and H. Parker Willis.
               United States devaluation discussed by Edmund Platt;
               Letter, December 16, 1936, from a bank president, urging
               Carter Glass to accept chairmanship of the full Banking
               and Currency Committee, rather than of the
               Appropriations Committee; Carter Glass replies that he
               would probably prefer to retain chairmanship of the
               Banking and Currency Subcommittee, because of his
               interest in Federal Reserve legislation; Several letters
               between Carter Glass, Harold L. Ickes, and A. Robertson,
               regarding discrimination in the approval of public works
               projects; Letters questioning Carter Glass as to whether
               he would support Franklin D. Roosevelt; Personal
               correspondence with Claude Swanson, Secretary of the
               Navy, November, 1936; Correspondence, October 6, 1936,
               in which Carter Glass refuses Senator Millard E. Tydings
               ' request to speak before a Democratic meeting in
               Baltimore on the presidential campaign between Franklin
               D. Roosevelt and Landon. Carter Glass fully outlines his
               thinking to Senator Millard E. Tydings; Telegrams from
               Carter Glass to Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, December 24, 1937,

               agencies; Correspondence congratulating Millard E.

               demand; The Castle Realty Corporation lists the four

               undated; About 10 or 15 accounts of a great tribute paid
               to "former President Woodrow Wilson " on the fifth

               defense of the Federal Reserve System by Carter Glass,

               20 or 30 articles dealing with the appointment by

               with Carter Glass' stand on the British Debt Refunding
               Bill which was evidently being debated in the Senate in

               of the Bill by Carter Glass on the Senate floor; At
               least 25 articles and editorials commenting on a speech

               investigations; Assorted reports of speeches on banking
               made by bankers at various conferences and meetings for

               the most part in the early 1920's; Assorted reports of
               speeches made on the League of Nations. For instance, on

               figure in the controversy.</p>
