      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists of 100 items, 1793-1874, n.d., and
         includes correspondence, business papers, legal papers, and
         miscellaneous material. A number of these pertain to 
         <persname>Matthew Fontaine Maury, Jr.</persname>, of 
         <geogname>Albemarle County, Virginia</geogname>. There are
         numerous letters written during the Civil War.</p>
      <p>Correspondence of the 
         <famname>Maury family</famname>dates 1822-1874, n.d. A letter
         dated November 4, 1823 from the 
         <corpname>Albemarle Court</corpname>states that 
         <persname>Thomas W. Maury</persname>has been appointed as
         School Commissioner. On January 13, 1837, from the 
         <corpname>House of Delegates</corpname>, 
         <persname>Alexander Rives</persname>complains to 
         <persname>Thomas Maury</persname>that "our party here, alack
         the day! is so far behind the spirit of their constituents,
         that they are most ingloriously succeeding on many occasions,
         to their enemies." On November 2[ ], 1855, 
         <persname>A. J. Meigs</persname>writes to Maury and mentions
         the latter's "disorder." There are letters of recommendation
         and introduction for 
         <persname>Matthew Fontaine Maury, Jr.</persname>during 1852
         and 1857. 
         <persname>J. Delafield</persname>writes to 
         <persname>Matthew Fontaine Maury, Jr.</persname>, in 
         <geogname>Liverpool</geogname>, on March 26, 1862, introducing
         Captain Clemenshaw who is recommended to Maury as a navigator
         in the 
         <corpname>Confederate Navy</corpname>. A copy of a letter,
         August 27, 1862, from 
         <persname>Rutson Maury, Jr.</persname>to 
         <persname>Rutson Maury</persname>, sends news of the family,
         the actions of Federal troops, and Union designs on
         Confederate ports, and mentions the absence of James. There
         are several letters to Maury from 
         <persname>J. Delafield</persname>and 
         <persname>A. S. Elmiger</persname>between 1862-1863,
         requesting to see him, apparently in relation to a financial
         dispute between them; letters of May 30, June 11, and June 16,
         1863, detail the dispute. On April 7, 1863, 
         <corpname>Keating and Company</corpname>writes to 
         <persname>J. Delafield</persname>asking for his opinion on the
         present state of the Confederate loan, and the prospect of
         recovery. "Hawkeye" writes to Maury on April 17 and 20, 1863,
         in regard to a controversy over an article in 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">The Mercury</title></bibref>entitled "Exposure of Northern Ladies," and a Mr.
         Spencer's actions concerning it. There is an interesting
         letter, April 25, 1863, from 
         <persname>James Maury</persname>to "Skinny Murphy," containing
         a cypher to "defy the inquisitors of even these miserable
         Yankees," and mentioning doing business with a Jew "in whom is
         plenty of guile" and having an interest in acquiring English
         milking cows and seed. 
         <persname>Rutson Maury</persname>writes to 
         <persname>Matthew Fontaine Maury, Jr.</persname>, on April 28,
         1863, mentioning that he had been reading a story for Sunday
         school children, "Little Ben, the motherless boy." 
         <persname>Ann Maury</persname>writes to 
         <persname>Matthew Fontaine Fontaine, Jr.</persname>, on June
         12, 1863, concerning personal matters, and mentions living in
         an atmosphere of tobacco and coal smoke with the comment
         "perhaps you think smoke is the best air for the lungs." 
         <persname>Rutson Maury</persname>writes to Matthew on January
         10, 1868, in a hand similar to gothic, that it is not yet
         decided who the Latin professor at 
         <corpname>Columbia College</corpname>would be. In a letter
         dated March 1, 1869 from, New Orleans, "Alex" writes to Maury
         confidential news of jealousy against Maury in the office. In
         a letter dated July 16, 1869, Abraham writes to 
         <persname>Matthew Fontaine Maury</persname>requesting a copy
         of the "Fontaine and Maury" family book. Included with a March
         13, 1870 letter from 
         <persname>A. M. Clayton</persname>to Maury, there is a
         newpaper article, which mentions a railroad accident near 
         <geogname>Oxford, Mississippi</geogname>on Southern RR track
         and includes the official comment by Col. 
         <persname>Sam Tate</persname>, president of the railroad. 
         <persname>Walker Maury</persname>writes to "Liz," on May 5,
         1870, mentioning that Matthew may be back from England in
         mid-October. Among the undated correspondence, 
         <persname>J. R. Lawrence</persname>claims that he will send
         money to Maury once he is paid.</p>
      <p>The business papers date 1793-1869 and n.d. There is a
         report, "Staves Most Suitable for the English Market," from
         the 
         <corpname>Drysdale Brothers</corpname>dated October 12, 1866.
         From 1867, there is a tide and shipping record, which includes
         an account with 
         <corpname>Maury and Company</corpname>, noting import duties
         on alcoholic beverages, and an attached card, "Rates of
         Compressing Cotton from 
         <corpname>Cotton Press Association of New Orleans</corpname>"
         for the year ending August 31, 1868. There is also a telegram
         sent from the 
         <corpname>Maury Bros.</corpname>to the 
         <corpname>Adderly Bros.</corpname>on August 24, 1869: "Tobacco
         much shortened by drought," with a note warning of tobacco
         speculation. There are minutes of the 
         <corpname>Albemarle Agricultural Society</corpname>re
         preparation for the annual show.</p>
      <p>Legal papers are for the period 1806-1823. For January 25,
         1806 is the will of 
         <persname>Benjamin Maury</persname>, bequesting his property
         to 
         <persname>Matthew R. Maury, Sr</persname>. There is an October
         23, 1823 subpoena for 
         <persname>Thomas Maury</persname>to testify on behalf of 
         <persname>Nelson Barksdale</persname>.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous papers date 1863-1867, n.d., and include a
         pamphlet, January 7, 1863, called the "Second Letter . . . to
         British Cotton Operatives," from a talk given by 
         <persname>John Cowell</persname>on September 12, 1862 and
         published in the 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">London Times</bibref>four days later. The author
         demands English (and French) intervention in the South's war
         with the North to help the Southern cotton industry. Also,
         there is a card from the 
         <corpname>Medical Department of the University of
         Louisana</corpname>--an "Order of Lectures" for the 1866-1867
         session. Among the undated items is a fragment of an ancient
         history text which mixes history and mythology legends; a
         notebook which contains lecture notes from scientific or
         technological coursework; recipes for milk punch and good ink;
         a detail of a rampart arc from a European gothic church,
         either French or Italian, with the caption in both tongues:
         "Dettaglio Di un' Arco Rampante" and "Detaile D' Un Arc
         Rampart."</p>
