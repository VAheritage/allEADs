            <p>[Discusses a vitriolic letter from Riding to Kemp,
                  September 15, 1970, and explains his relationship to
                  Riding, "My poems came under her scrutiny when 
                  <persname>James Reeves</persname>sent a batch to her
                  in Deya. I gratefully accepted most of her many
                  detailed suggestions for improvement; upon which they
                  were considered good enough for 
                  <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Epilogue</bibref>-a Critical Summary edited
                  and largely written by herself, with Graves as
                  associate editor, sole financial backer and, among
                  others, contributor by invitation." Kemp concluded
                  that Riding must have assumed that he had sided with 
                  <persname>Robert Graves</persname>in their dispute
                  and "felt justified in treating me as an enemy." He
                  goes on to mention the quarrels Riding had with many
                  of the writers she was associated with and was
                  persuaded that "the vision of her as a `sick' woman
                  was perhaps too charitable a view." He summarizes his
                  opinion of Riding, "Riding's trouble has always been
                  her inability to see herself as a poet among poets.
                  She has also had difficulty in recognizing that the
                  young men and women she `lessoned' in the late
                  thirties have long since grown up. I regard her now
                  less as a once helpful parent-figure than as an
                  inveterate trouble-maker."</p>

                  worded letter to Kemp in the third person upon the

                  him requesting "information as to the availability of

                  allusion is made in that preface [to a selection of

                  believes to be in error, especially an acknowledgment
                  mentioning
