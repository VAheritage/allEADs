      <p>Berry was acting as agent for John Campbell, having
         continued the work commenced by Duncan Campbell's agent John
         Rose. The letters recount Berry's efforts to obtain payment of
         debts owed to Duncan Campbell at the time of the Revolutionary
         War, explaining the progress of their claims through the
         courts. They discuss the sale of cargo to settle some debts,
         land sales in Kentucky and Ohio, and the farm economy, and
         mention several debtors in the families of Matthews, Murdock,
         Page, Stewart/Stuart, and Tayloe. A letter of June 10, 1810
         relates aspects of Duncan Campbell's case, indicating that
         most claims appear to have been contracted in the years 1774
         and 1775, after which time no payments were made to British
         creditors, and maintaining that there was no inaccuracy in the
         records of the claims kept by Campbell's agent Thomas Hodge.
         There is a letter, December 2, 1810, from Thomas Swann to
         Benjamin Botts, concerning the Page estate as related to
         Campbell. A letter of December 6,1813, relates the progress of
         the sale of lands in Kentucky and mentions the death of
         Benjamin Botts the previous December. A letter of May 12, 1817
         mentions the sale of lands in Kentucky. The destruction of
         wheat crops by worms or Hessian flies was mentioned in letters
         of June 8, 1806 and May 12, 1817. On August 22, 1822, Laurence
         W. Berry writes concerning the death of his father and
         promises to acquaint himself with the state of his father's
         transactions as Campbell's agent; he quotes a portion of
         Laurence Berry's will relating to the affairs of Duncan
         Campbell, such negotiations commenced by John Rose as agent
         for Campbell. A letter of July 28, 1832 pertains to the sale
         of land in Ohio. There is a copy of a letter, March 10, 1846,
         from John Scott to William Campbell concerning the affairs of
         the Campbell estate. John Scott gives the news of the death of
         his son-in-law, Laurence W. Berry, to Campbell, nephew of John
         Campbell and grandson of Duncan Campbell. He relates in detail
         the progress of the affairs upon examination of the papers of
         Berry as agent in winding up the business of his uncle and
         grandfather. Also included as a copy of a letter, June 12,
         1847, from John Scott to Folly, Smith, Hunter, and Grattan,
         solicitors for the late William Campbell, relating the affairs
         of the Campbell estate. Related letters from John Rose to
         Duncan Campbell are located in accession #11327.</p>
