      <p>Letters, 1838-1843, from Edward S. Brown while a student at
         Randolph Macon College in Boydton, Virginia, to his mother,
         Nancy H. Brown, and siblings, Elizabeth A., Daniel, Mary C.,
         and Thomas C. Brown, chiefly concern his personal and
         educational life at college. On February 18, 1838, Brown
         writes that he expects to stand his examination on Virgil, he
         dislikes the prospect of facing both Latin and Greek, a new
         grammar was introduced in the school, and the preparatory
         school is much larger this year. On April 14, 1838, Brown
         mentions brothers Henry and Robert planning to go to Missouri,
         the effects of the current revival of religion on the college,
         and reading Virgil. As the end of the spring session nears, he
         writes on June 4, 1839, requesting the family to send Charles
         to him as well as a small amount of money and a horse by the
         19th of the month. A letter of September 27, 1841, discusses
         the health of his brother, Thomas, and his recovery at sea. On
         October 16, 1841, Brown writes that his professor suggests he
         stand an examination on some of his studies prior to leaving
         for the session; suggests plans for sending Charles to him;
         suggests Thomas go to Texas or Cuba instead of Rio for his
         health; and, mentions Texas favorably "as it is generally
         inhabited by our own countrymen..." A letter of January 30,
         1842, discusses the effects of "neuro electric fluid" or
         "mesmeric fluid" on the human body; and refers to studying law
         along with regular duties and mentions the high cost of law
         books. On January 30, 1842, Brown mentions his brother Thomas'
         health and relates a secondhand account of the wedding of
         "Miss Harriet." A letter of May 15, 1842, mentions
         commencement, plans to send Charles to him, and news of the
         Randolph Macon College faculty, including Sims who went to
         Tuscaloosa to teach at the University of Alabama. The letter
         also mentions that the temperance reformation speeches given
         by Mr. Cary of Baltimore, Maryland are usually followed by a
         revival. On August 29, 1843, Brown is looking forward to
         completing his studies; he also discusses the Campbellites and
         other religions in Hopewell, Virginia. There is also a letter,
         March 25, 1844, from A. Clarke at Randolph Macon College to
         Edward S. Brown, giving his impressions of the study of
         astronomy, mental philosophy, and French; revealing that they
         are engaged in the calculation of the eclipse; expressing his
         mixed feelings toward commencement and revealing his plans
         following commencement. Clarke also mentions Governor [James]
         McDowell and details personal characteristics of his intended,
         a Miss Louise C. J. of Mecklenburg, Virginia.</p>
      <p>Correspondence of the Brown family cover a variety of
         subjects. A letter of November 22, [1838], from A. D. Brown,
         Wythe Courthouse, to Fanny P. Brown, mentions their father
         going to Missouri, Leander Sanders bringing a store to Wythe,
         and the citizens of Wythe trying to get a female teacher from
         Washington City. A letter, October 21, 1845, from [C. M.]
         Garland, Rectory, Berryville, to Sarah C. Brown, concerns his
         trip to Charlottesville and "Castle Hill," and mentions Mr.
         [William?] Meade's church being occupied by Presbyterians
         while they were in town and hearing the new chaplain, [ ]
         Jackson, at the University of Virginia Chapel. On June 28,
         1847, J. E. Brown, Richmond, writes to Jane S. Brown, with
         news of his stop in Lynchburg and his religious activities in
         Richmond, including hearing a sermon at St. Paul's Church,
         attending the anniversary of the Sunday School at Trinity
         Chapel (Methodist), and attending the First Presbyterian
         Church. A letter, September 29, 1847, from [Margaret Brown]
         Wilmer, Rectory, Berryville, to "Sally" [Sarah C. (Mrs. Robert
         L.) Brown], relates plans of her and her husband, [Richard
         Hooker] Wilmer, reveals that "Mammy" wishes to go to
         Charlottesville, and refers to the beautiful countryside. A
         letter, January 1, 1850, from James A. Forbes, Lovingston, to
         Robert L. Brown, discusses the purchase of the Tavern House
         and appurtenances of Captain Loving in the town of Lovingston.
         On September 26, 1850, J. E. Brown, Cobbler's Spring,
         Wytheville, writes to Jane S. Brown, mentioning that Miss
         Ruggles has commenced her school with the prospect of as many
         scholars as she had last year; giving personal, family and
         local news; and revealing arrangements for a trip to
         Charlottesville to see the University of Virginia and
         "Monticello." A letter, March 5, 1851, from E. O. Dance to
         Edward S. Brown concerns a deposition; a letter is written on
         this one from "Jinnie," Lynchburg, to Jane [M. Brown],
         concerning local religious activities: the new Episcopal
         Church where [John Cowper] Granbery preaches; Brother Walker
         preaching for the "coloured" people; and, there being no sign
         of revival among the churches. On August 4, 1851, Jane M.
         Brown, Woodlawn, Lynchburg, writes to Edward S. Brown,
         mentioning church attendance, [John Cowper] Granbery, personal
         and family matters, her love for the servants, and McGee's
         revival continuing. A letter of June 27, 1853, to Edward S.
         Brown, Powhatan, discusses a controversy between [Philip St.
         George] Cocke and Mr. Finch. On November 1, Fanny [P. Brown],
         Wytheville, writes to James E. Brown, Christiansburg, of
         personal and family news and mentions her improvement in
         health being due to either Townsend's Sarsparilla or the cool
         weather.</p>
