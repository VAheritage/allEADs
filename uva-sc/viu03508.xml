      <p>Summaries of the content of each group of correspondence
         follows immediately in the guide, in the order of their
         appearance in the folder listing, beginning with the first
         series consisting of correspondence to and from Joseph C.
         Cabell.</p>
      <p>The first series in this collection consists of the
         correspondence of Joseph Carrington Cabell arranged
         alphabetically according to the last name of the
         correspondent. The correspondence from Edward Carrington
         Cabell to Joseph C. Cabell is chiefly concerned with his
         father's health and an invitation to his uncle to visit
         him.</p>
      <p>Hannah Carrington Cabell writes to her son, Joseph and his
         new wife, Mary (also called "Polly") at the beginning of their
         marriage in 1807, chiefly about domestic news and concerns,
         including discussions of household furnishings, weaving wool,
         and other household and clothing needs. Hannah Cabell resided
         at "Harewood" following the death of her husband and daughter
         to care for her granddaughters. She often refers to the poor
         health of Dr. Hare and other family members.</p>
      <p>Hannah Cabell also refers to a slave sale from the estate
         of Samuel [Wenfrey?] (1808 Oct 23 and Nov 3); the poor health
         of her son and his brother, Nicholas (1808 Dec 28; 1809 Jun
         17); arrangements made for the summer clothes of the slaves
         and work on Joseph's house waiting for the arrival of the
         carpenter (1810 Jun 19); her purchase of one slave boy eleven
         years old (1811 Feb 12); a slave, John, who ran away after
         being punished with a switch by his master (1812 Mar 29); her
         trip to Warm Springs and White Sulphur Springs (1812 Aug 11);
         brief references to the War of 1812, including "our late and
         glorious victories," perhaps on Lake Erie (1813 Oct 3) and the
         peace negotiations (1815 Mar 5); requests for four or five
         dozen bottles of port wine for the health of Dr. Hare (1816
         Mar 1); the runaway slave of Dr. Hare, [Leroy?], son of Toby
         at "Bon Aire" (1816 Jun 23); request for Joseph to attend a
         slave auction in Richmond for her on January 2nd to purchase a
         lad of fifteen or sixteen, able to handle a plow (1816 Dec 16
         and 30); and the death of the wife of General John Hartwell
         Cocke, Ann Blaws (1817 Jan 26).</p>
      <p>The correspondence of Dr. John Grattan Cabell (1817-1896)
         is chiefly concerned with business conducted for his uncle but
         also mentions a cholera epidemic at Richmond (1854 July 13);
         and the death of his wife, Sarah Marshal Tankersley, leaving
         him with a daughter, Sarah Elizabeth Cabell (1855 Apr 7).</p>
      <p>The correspondence of Joseph C. Cabell to John H. Cocke,
         1810-1848 (5 folders), reveals many details of this deep and
         long-lasting friendship between these two men, including much
         personal news, details of their agricultural pursuits, and
         requests for help or advice. There are few references to his
         work with the University of Virginia, except general mentions
         of the meetings of the Board of Visitors. There is also little
         political content, except for references to his interest in
         internal improvements and the James River and Kanawha Canal
         Company.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, there are a few letters to or from the wives
         of the two men in these folders and they have been kept with
         the letters of their husbands. These include one from Joseph
         C. Cabell to Anne B. Cocke, wife of John H. Cocke (1810 Aug
         5), and several letters from Mary W. Cabell to the Cockes
         (November 11 and December 17, 1816).</p>
      <p>Among the topics in the letters from the first folder from
         Cabell to Cocke are: discussion of the Corotoman Plantation,
         Lancaster County, Virginia, and the settlement of the Estate
         (1811 Jan 11; 1812 Sep 20, Nov 16, Dec 15 and 16; 1813 Jan
         16); the names and prices of slaves from Corotoman Plantation
         sold for "incorrigible conduct" (1813 Jan 5); his support for
         Colonel James Monroe in the next race for governor (1811 Jan
         11); agricultural improvements and his plans to introduce the
         "Albemarle system" at Edgewood, Nelson County, Virginia (1811
         Jun 3); seeks advice about hiring a new overseer (1814 Aug 8);
         news of the reappearing of the enemy in the Chesapeake Bay
         (1814 Nov 3); the Howard's Land scheme (1815 Jul 3 and 11);
         requests for Cocke's assistance in the selection of new
         slaves, fearing the "hardiness of the lowland Negroes" (1816
         Jun 10); mention of a runaway slave, named Abraham, originally
         from Corotoman (1816 Aug 22); the deteriorating health of Ann
         B. Cocke (1816 Dec 20 and 26) her death (1817 Jan 2); and his
         plans to build an enclosure for the graveyard (1819 Jun
         26).</p>
      <p>Topics in the second folder to Cocke include:
         recommendation of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Millwrights Guide</title>by Oliver
         Evans (1820 Aug 23); requests that Cocke's man, Peter,
         initiate Cabell's slave Quintilian "into the arcana of his
         shop, he has a great desire to advance himself in his beloved
         art" and mentions another slave, Will, from Corotoman who has
         come up to see the mountains and "to be cured of the habit of
         running away." He also mentions improvements in his barn
         designed by the machinist Andrew Duncan and Cocke's upcoming
         marriage to Louisa Maxwell Holmes (all of the above in letter,
         1821 Jun 9).</p>
      <p>Many of his letters in 1821 and 1822 discuss his
         unhappiness with his current overseer, whose mismanagement has
         already cost him a good deal, his attempts to hire a new
         overseer, and his despair that the machinist Duncan will ever
         complete his work at Cabell's farm (1821 Jul 8, 29; Aug 10;
         Sep 16; Nov 22; 1822 Sep 6-7; Oct 24 and 31). Cabell also
         praises the superior work of Cato, a slave belonging to J.H.
         Cocke, on his mill (1822 Aug 24). Other topics include his
         brother's financial difficulties (1821 Sep 21, Oct 4); and the
         destruction by fire of one of his barns with 200 barrels of
         corn at Corotoman (1822 Mar 13).</p>
      <p>He expresses his concern over the possible loss of his farm
         book for 1822, his accounts of his expenditures for his mill
         and barn, and his last settlement with Duncan (1823 Jul 9) and
         his gladness that he purchased "Midway" despite the opposition
         of his family (1824 Jun 15). He discusses his improvements at
         "Edgewood" and skilled slave laborers carrying out the work
         (1825 Jul 22, 26; Aug 6); the death of Edmund Harrison of
         Amelia County (1826 Feb 5); and praise for John Cocke, son of
         John Hartwell Cocke (1825 Jul 22).</p>
      <p>In the third folder to Cocke, Cabell discusses the progress
         on and hopes for the James River and Kanawha Canal (1824 Aug
         15, 22, 28; Sep 23; 1826 Oct 15) and Claudius Crozet in
         reference to the Canal (1824 Jun 20 and Nov 8; 1826 Sep 2). He
         also feels the pressure of trying to sell the land belonging
         to his brother George (1826 Sep 2). He also describes his
         religious practice (1828 Aug 21) and his preparations for the
         construction of his ice house (1828 Oct 27). Cabell refers to
         the meeting of the Board of Public Works in Richmond and the
         discussion of the [Internal Improvement?] Convention Question
         in the House of Delegates, which he fears will not result in
         any extension of internal improvements (1829 Jan 10). He
         includes a detailed discussion of several types of wheat
         harvesting machines, their designs and merits (1829 Dec
         15).</p>
      <p>The fourth and fifth folders of correspondence to Cocke
         contain several references to his interests in the James River
         and Kanawha Canal Company. Among these are: the delay in
         opening up the stock subscription until the August Court (1832
         Aug 7); the meeting of the stockholders (1835 May 15); the
         visit of the committee composed of members of both houses in
         the Virginia Legislature investigating the affairs of the
         company (1843 Jan 25); descriptions of damages to the canal
         and other matters concerning its operation (1843 Apr 19; 1844
         Jan 25, Mar 28); a discussion of the desire of Governor
         McDowell to transfer the James River and Kanawha Canal Company
         and its works to the state (1843 Nov 10); and the strong
         railroad interests acting against the James River and Kanawha

         (Randolph Harrison, 1819 Mar 23); revising the proof sheets of
         the pamphlet by Joseph Cabell (James E. Heath, 1831 Aug 8);
         description of the action taken by the Virginia House of
         Delegates and Senate on the amendment to the James River Bill
         (William C. Holt, 1823 Feb 25); and details about a plaster
         mill (Charles F. Mercer, 1820 Sep 6).</p>
      <p>Additional topics in the Miscellaneous Correspondents
         include: discussion about printing and circulating some
         letters of James Madison (Hugh Mercer, 1829 Mar 4); discussion
         of the judicial system of Virginia (Charles L. Mosby, 1850 Aug
         10); the death of a slave, Oscar (T. Oldham, 1849 Nov 24);
         description of a hemp and flax breaking machine (James
         Pleasants, 1822 Apr 1); quest to have his brother, Francis,
         appointed Elector for his district (James P. Preston, 1816 Jan
         14); misunderstanding during a debate over a bill (James
         Robertson, 1816 Feb 6); medical advice (Dr. William Southall,
         1818 Nov 18); and information about the theft of a young
         female slave belonging to the overseer of Joseph Cabell, Mr.
         Poor, supposedly stolen by Johnson alias Smith and the free
         "Negro" Joe Ligon, whose registry transcription is included
         with the letter (Colonel Park Street, 1818 Apr 8).</p>
      <p>The second series of papers consists of the correspondence
         of members of the Bolling family, the Cabell family, and
         related families. The papers of the Bolling family, especially
         those of Colonel William Bolling, Goochland County, Virginia,
         are most likely found in this collection because William
         Bolling was a commissioner and agent for the James River and
         Kanawha Canal Company who collected subscriptions for stock in
         this company. Joseph C. Cabell was also heavily involved in
         the company as president.</p>
      <p>Folders containing correspondence to members of the Bolling
         family include several letters from Jane Bolling to her
         father, William Bolling, while she was visiting in Washington,
         (Box 6); Sally F. Cabell to her brother and sister-in-law,
         Philip and Julia Bolling Cabell (Box 8); miscellaneous
         correspondents to William Bolling arranged alphabetically (Box
         10); miscellaneous correspondents to the Bolling family (Box
         10); and miscellaneous correspondents to Philip B. Cabell and
         his wife, Julia Bolling Cabell (Box 10).</p>
      <p>Also in this series is considerable correspondence from
         Sally Faulcon Cocke Brent (1816-1879) to her sister, Ann Blaws
         Cocke Cabell (1811-1862) consisting of much news about the
         different families (Box 6), and ten letters from Sally Brent
         and her husband, Arthur Lee Brent, to her brother-in-law,
         Nathaniel Francis Cabell (Box 6). Both groups of letters
         contain some correspondence about their attitudes and
         activities concerning the Civil War.</p>
      <p>Much of the remaining correspondence in this series
         consists of letters to and from Nathaniel Francis Cabell
         (1807-1891), his wife, Ann Blaws Cocke Cabell, and their
         immediate family members. Nathaniel Francis Cabell, who
         married Anne Blaws Cocke (1811-1862), the daughter of John
         Hartwell Cocke, in 1831, inherited the Liberty Hall estate in
         Nelson County, Virginia. He was the son of Nicholas
         (1780-1809) and Margaret Venable Cabell (1782-1857) and nephew
         of Joseph C. Cabell.</p>
      <p>There are over a hundred letters from Ann Blaws Cocke
         Cabell to her husband (Box 6) and about eighty from Nathaniel
         Francis Cabell to his wife (Box 7). This collection also
         contains about sixty letters from Ann Cabell to her son,
         Philip Barraud Cabell (Box 6). There are many letters from
         Elizabeth Nicholas Cabell to her mother, Ann Cabell (Boxes
         6-7); Philip B. Cabell to both parents (Box 8); Sally F.
         Cabell to her father, Nathaniel Francis Cabell (Box 8);
         William D. Cabell to his in-laws (Box 8); and many letters
         from Lucy Oliver Cocke, wife of Dr. Cary Charles Cocke, to her
         sister-in-law, Anne Blaws Cocke Cabell (Box 9).</p>
      <p>Other correspondents writing to Nathaniel Francis Cabell
         include: Dr. John Grattan Cabell, 1861-1863, chiefly about the
         Civil War and the sale of a slave, Lewis, December 3,
         [1862?](Box 7); Mary W. Cabell, chiefly about borrowing books
         and the New Jerusalem Church doctrine (Box 7); H.H. Hite
         dealing with the depredations experienced in Virginia during
         the Civil War and Reconstruction and being cut off from the
         Northern brethren of the New Jerusalem Church because of the
         conflict (Box 10); Benjamin H. Magruder, Scottsville,
         Virginia, about the sale of property (Box 10); Cabell's
         cousin, Ella Floyd Mosby, chiefly about borrowing books and
         the New Jerusalem Church doctrine (Box 10); and Judge Francis
         Nathaniel Watkins (1813-1885), Farmville, Virginia, about the
         destruction of the Civil War, old times, religious ideas, and
         genealogical questions (Box 11). An obituary for Watkins can
         be found at the end of his letters.</p>
      <p>Nathaniel Francis Cabell writes to his cousin, Isaac Read,
         discussing the loss of his wife and other family members (1862
         May, 1864 May 7) and other family troubles, and his remarriage
         to Mary M. Kellar, of Baltimore, Maryland (1867 Oct). Cabell
         also describes the centennial of his school, Hampden Sidney
         College (1876 Aug 16) to Read (Box 8).</p>
      <p>The correspondence of Isaac Read to Cabell can be found in
         Box 11. These letters discuss the issue of slavery and the
         sectional strife of the country (1855 Dec 9; 1860 Jun 18; 1861
         Feb 10), the Civil War service of Read's sons (1861 Sep 6);
         the death of General Philip St. George Cocke (1862 Jan 1); the
         progress and destructions of the Civil War (all letters
         1861-1865); Reconstruction politics (1867 Oct 16; 1868 Mar 4);
         his move to Brooklyn, New York, to live with his oldest son,
         partially to avoid the problems of Reconstruction and the
         utter ruin of the South (1872-1984); the location of each of
         his sons (1874 Sep 27; 1875 Jan 31, including ideas about the
         Beecher scandal; 1876 Jun 12); and his preparation for
         death.</p>
      <p>Correspondence from Nathaniel Francis Cabell to his
         father-in-law, John Hartwell Cocke (Box 7), is concerned with
         the building of his house on the Liberty Hall estate,
         references to family slaves, agricultural advice and
         questions, and the business of the James River &amp; Kanawha
         Canal Company. Cabell also discusses his belief and
         involvement in the New Jerusalem Church. For an example, see
         the letter from N.F. Cabell to Cocke, dated July 29, 1840. He
         also discusses the temperance issue, the affairs of the
         University of Virginia, the Sprague and Delavan controversy
         (1842 Apr 11), and his progress in agriculture.</p>
      <p>Correspondence from John Hartwell Cocke to his son-in-law,
         Nathaniel Francis Cabell can be found in Box 9. Topics in
         these letters include: advice about the operation of Cabell's
         plantation; work on his house; the urgency of road improvement
         in their areas; the evils of alcohol, especially among the
         Irish and German laborers (1836 May 30) and the questions
         about use of wine in communion (1837 Feb 24); the progress of
         the James River and Kanawha Canal Company (1836 Dec 20; 1842
         Oct 10); theological arguments (1837 Mar 26); a prescription
         for epilepsy (1839 Jul 19); and Cocke's opinion of
         Swedenborgism (1840 Aug 21).</p>
      <p>Other topics include: an admonition to Cabell to change
         himself from "a reading man to a working man" in order to save
         his plantation and make it a paying affair (1840 Dec 3; 1841
         Oct 5); advances in the temperance movement (1848 Aug-1849
         Jul); notice that one vacancy may be available in Cocke's
         school and a list of slaves with their ages from his register
         (1850 Sep 4 and 30); the presidential election, the Maine Law,
         and request for N.F. Cabell's opinion of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Uncle Tom's Cabin</title>(1852 Nov 5);
         Cocke's opinion of a book on slavery called 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Impending Crisis</title>by Hinton
         Rowan Helper, 1829-1909, (1857 Oct 2); and his attempt to find
         out if Philip B. Cabell has accepted the position as military
         aid to Philip St. George Cocke (1861 Aug 20).</p>
      <p>Letters from Nathaniel Francis Cabell to his son, Philip
         Barraud Cabell, in the first folder were chiefly written while
         Philip was being educated at the school at Bremo, Fluvanna
         County, and then at the University of Virginia, 1853-1857 and
         are full of admonishment and fatherly advice. The second
         folder contains letters during the Civil War period,
         1861-1863, one mentioning the condition of the slaves at the
         hospital in Richmond (1863 Oct 28), and other letters to
         Philip after he had moved to Urbana, Ohio, to teach at the
         Urbana University in 1875. Among these is a letter about the
         sale of the Laneville estate, located about a mile below
         Warminster, Nelson County, Virginia, and the troubles of the
         family (1875 Oct 5).</p>
      <p>Many of the letters of Philip B. Cabell were written to his
         parents while he was away from home for educational purposes.
         There are also letters written during the Civil War in the
         second folder of his correspondence, describing his military
         service as a volunteer aide to General Philip St. George Cocke
         (see time of service document, Oct 1861).</p>
      <p>The interest of Nathaniel Francis Cabell in the writings of
         Emanuel Swendenborg and the New Jerusalem Church, in which he
         was baptized in 1842 by the Reverend Richard De Charms of
         Baltimore, Maryland, is illustrated in this collection by his
         correspondence with and about the Reverend George Bush (Boxes
         6 and 8) and with the Reverend Richard De Charms (Boxes 8 and
         9). There are also some news clippings about George Bush and
         some manuscripts and notes about the New Jerusalem Church in
         the third series of papers (Box 12). Cabell was also
         interested in John Randolph of Roanoke and there is one folder
         of letters from him to miscellaneous correspondents about
         Randolph (Box 8).</p>

      <p>This collection is arranged in three series: 1)
         Correspondence of Joseph C. Cabell (Boxes 1-5); 2)
         Correspondence of the Bolling, Cabell and Related families
         (Boxes 6-11); and 3) Legal, Financial and Miscellaneous Papers
         (Boxes 11-12). The family had bundled the correspondence
         chiefly by correspondent name and this arrangement has been
         refined and preserved.</p>
