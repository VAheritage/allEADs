      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This item, a 9.5 x 7.5 inch black and white mounted
         photograph, ca. 1910, is of African-Americans at a reunion of
         Grand Army of the Republic (G. A. R.), in Norfolk, Virginia.
         It is believed photographer H. (Harry) C. Mann took it at
         Elmwood Cemetery. (In 1920, in the black section of the city's
         West Point Cemetery [now Elmwood], black Norfolkians dedicated
         a monument featuring a life-sized black Union soldier in
         remembrance of African-American soldiers and seamen. It
         remains the only black Civil War soldiers' monument in the
         South and bears the inscription, "To The Memory of Our
         Heroes.") Forty-one individuals, mostly veterans of black
         Union regiments recruited in the area during the Civil War,
         dressed in G.A.R. uniforms and insignia or civilian clothes,
         are present. 
         <emph render="super">1</emph></p>
      <p>The first soldier on the left front row (wearing officers'
         bars, gauntlets and carrying a sword) may be wearing a
         Spanish-American War veteran's officer's uniform. According to
         a lithograph broadside, "Soldier's Memorial/Spanish-American
         War of 1898" by F. A. Neubauer of Cincinnati, Ohio, and a
         Jones family tradition, this soldier may be Kinchen Jones, who
         served as a wagoner in Company D, 6th Virginia Volunteer
         Infantry Regiment (Sixth Virginia Volunteers), mustered into
         federal service at Norfolk on August 4, 1898. It is also
         believed one of the elderly veterans in the photograph is
         Kinchen Jones' father (front row, third from left, with a
         white moustache; front row, second from right, with white
         moustache and goatee, or, second row, fourth from right, with
         a white moustache, goatee and bow tie).</p>
      <p>Under limited digital scanning/enhancement Jones's collar
         bears the insignia "9th Va." However, published references
         concerning a black Virginia military unit with this
         designation have not been found. Another possibility is that
         he is wearing a G. A. R. uniform and "9th Va." designates a
         specific G. A. R. post in the Hampton Roads area. G. A. R.
         posts were racially segregated and often this veterans'
         organization did not permit blacks to join or participate in
         its activities, especially in the South. According to a 1900
         Norfolk directory, there were three black posts in the city:
         Cailloux Post No. 2, Dalhgren [Dahlgren] Post No. 4, Shaw Post
         No. 5, and, an "Armory." Digital enhancement of the hats of
         two veterans suggests they were members of Dalhgren [Dahlgren]
         Post No. 4 (front row, second and sixth from left).

         187. Nine United States Colored Troops units were organized in
         Virginia during 1863-64: six infantry, two cavalry, and one
         artillery battery. Five of the infantry regiments were
         organized in Norfolk and Portsmouth; most of their soldiers
         were former slaves. The 1910 city directory misspells
         "Dalhgren Post No. 4"; black Union veterans named it in honor
         of Colonel Ulric Dahlgren (1842- 1864), leader of the ill-
         fated Kilpatrick-Dahlgren Raid on Richmond. Ervin L. Jordan,
