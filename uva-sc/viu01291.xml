      <p>Jackson Davis was born in Cumberland County, Virginia, on
         September 25, 1882, the son of William Anderson and Sally
         Wyatt (Guy) Davis. He attended the public schools of Richmond,
         Virginia, and received his B. A. from the College of William
         and Mary in 1902 and his M. A. from Columbia University in
         1908. Honorary L.L.D. degrees were conferred upon him by the
         University of Richmond in 1930 and the College of William and
         Mary in 1931.</p>
      <p>Following graduation from William and Mary he was the
         principal of the public schools of Williamsburg, Virginia. He
         was assistant secretary of the Roanoke, Virginia YMCA from
         1903- 1904, was principal of the public schools of Marion,
         Virginia from 1904-1905, and was superintendent of schools in
         Henrico County, Virginia from 1905-1909. From 1909-1910 he was
         a member of the state board of examiners and inspectors of the
         Virginia State Board of Education, and from 1910-1915 he was
         state agent for African-American rural schools for the
         Virginia State Department of Education. In 1915 he became
         affiliated with the General Education Board in New York, New
         York, as a field agent. Two years later he was transferred to
         New York city as the board's general field agent, in which
         capacity he remained until 1929 when he was made assistant
         director. He became associate director in 1933 and
         vice-president and director in 1946. Throughout his career
         Davis specialized in Southern education, interracial problems,
         and education in Belgian Congo and Liberia. In 1935 he went to
         Africa as a Carnegie visitor, and in 1944 went again as head
         of a group sent by the Foreign Missions Conference of North
         America, the British Conference of Missions, and the Phelps-
         Stokes Fund. Davis was also a trustee of the Phelps-Stokes
         Fund, an organization devoted to African-American education
         and race relations both in America and in Africa. He became
         vice president of the fund in 1940, and succeeded Anson Phelps
         Stokes as president in 1946. During the years of his
         association with the General Education Board its work was
         concentrated on education in the Southern states and Davis'
         influence on behalf of better relations and understanding
         between whites and African-Americans and his pioneer work in
         promoting regional centers of education in the South were of
         immense significance. At the time of his death he was
         president of the board of trustees of Booker T. Washington
         Institute in Libera, president of the New York State
         Colonization Society, and a member of the Commission on
         Interracial Cooperation and of the Advisory Committee on
         Education in Liberia. He served as a member of the board of
         visitors of the College of William and Mary during 1913-1920
         and as secretary of the International Education Board from
         1923- 1938. Davis and Margaret Wong co-authored Africa
         Advancing in 1946, a book providing the results of the survey
         made in 1944; he was also a frequent contributor to
         educational journals.</p>
      <p>Davis was a member of the Sons of the American Revolution,
         Virginia Academy of Science, Virginia Historical Society, Phi
         Beta Kappa, Theta Delta Chi, Phi Delta Kappa, and the Town
         Hall and Century clubs. He was married in Bluffton, Georgia,
         on May 9, 1911, to Corinne Mansfield ( -1941), and they had
         two daughters, Helen Mansfield who married John Phillip Lynch,
         Jr., and Ruth Elizabeth, who married Charles Rolfe Langhorne.
         Davis died in Cartersville, Virginia, on April 15, 1947.</p>
