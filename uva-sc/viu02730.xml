      <p>This collection consists of the professional correspondence

         University of Virginia and an English professor at East
         Carolina College, Greenville, North Carolina, ca. 360 items (5
         Hollinger boxes, 1.5 linear feet), 1851-1964, and undated.</p>
      <p>These papers pertain to her research on Robert Browning and
         the publication of her book, Browning and America, by The
         University of North Carolina Press in Chapel Hill. Louise
         Greer received her Ph. D. from the University of Virginia in
         1953, and her book, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Browning and America</title>is based
         upon research for her dissertation.</p>
      <p>These materials include Greer's own collection of original
         letters to Robert Browning from Americans who admired his
         work, most of whom were literary figures themselves, and one
         original Browning letter to Percy Parks, January 12, 1887,
         concerning Parks' difficulty in interpreting his poetry.

         dates of their letters, are listed in alphabetical order and
         comprise the first series of this collection.</p>

         item originally accessioned as #5426. The rest of the material
         is part of accession #5426-a.</p>

         professional correspondence with other Browning scholars and
         correspondence with persons who possessed Browning material;
         notes for lectures about Browning to literary groups given by
         Greer; and photographs used as illustrations in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Browning and America</title>.</p>
