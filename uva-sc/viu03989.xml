</head>
      <p>This collection consists of about 37 items, 1870-1928, all concerning the Leander McCormick Observatory at the University of Virginia, and includes correspondence, plans and blueprints for the observatory by Wilson Brothers &amp; Co. of Philadelphia, an article from <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Nature</title> on the Newall telescope, annotated by [Leander J. McCormick?], and inscribed by him to his grandson. 
</p>
      <p>
The correspondence concerns expert advice solicited by McCormick from J. H. Safford, Dearborn Observatory, Chicago, Professor Joseph Henry, Smithsonian Institution, and Simon Newcomb, Naval Observatory, about the construction and design of an observatory; the selection of the University of Virginia over Washington and Lee as the site for an observatory; the building of the observatory at Virginia and the establishment of astronomy scholarships and additional funding for the astronomy program.

          <scopecontent>
            <p>Answering McCormick's request about the best location for observatory in Virginia, Venable firmly suggests the University of Virginia as an established institution and leader for education throughout the entire South. He also points out reasons why Washington College is not a suitable location for McCormick's great telescope. Also present is an enclosure describing the necessary main instruments and attachments for a great telescope, such as that proposed by McCormick.

He also warns McCormick to make sure his contract for the glass of the telescope includes a requirement that all the tests of a good glass be conducted before he accepts it.

            <p>While pleased at the progress of the observatory, McCormick further discusses the details of the naming of the observatory, "The resolution does not quite cover the conditions as given in my letter of June 13th I not only asked that the enterprise be known but that it should be 'published for all time' as the Leander McCormick Observatory meaning thereby that the 'name' should become just as familiar to the students &amp; the public as the fact that they had an observatory which can only be accomplished by having the full title given in all printed matter. . . ." This is a draft of the original letter sent to Venable while he was vacationing at Longdale, Alleghany County, Virginia.

            <p>Additional funds from McCormick family in the form of a grant of $4500 (an increase of $575), "It is not as much as I personally should have liked but still it is something. I do not think that any stipulation as when it should be spent will be made to you. We can assuredly leave to you the manner of its expenditure in the best interests of the observatory and its staff." He also asks for copies of pictures of the solar eclipse.

            <p>Discusses the loss to the state resulting from the death of Robert E. Lee on October 12, 1870 and his work in making Washington College a first-rate institution; believes an application will be made immediately to the Legislature to change the name of the college to Washington and Lee. At the next meeting, they will elect a successor to Lee and resolve to do all they can to carry out General Lee's plan to make Washington College a great American University and "a lasting monument to General Lee." One possible successor named was General George Washington Custis Lee, his eldest son. He also implores McCormick to continue to consider Washington College as the site of his observatory in spite of Lee's death. Notation on envelope- "Mr. C.  McCormick will please forward immediately to his Brother."

            <p>Letter  and accompanying Resolutions from a Public Meeting of citizens of Rockbridge County, dated November 6, 1870, in which they urge McCormick, "to establish such an observatory at Washington and Lee University and thus develop his own comprehensive views in practical connection with those of General Lee in promoting the cause of science in the University of his own country and in consummating the noble purpose of its illustrious President for the advancement of literary and scientific culture among the young men of the South." A note on the back of page four of the resolutions says, "I am greatly sorry that they did not get the Great Telescope. The within shows how much interest the whole community took in it. They may lay the failure at the door of J. D. Davidson." -L. J. McCormick

            <p> An eleven page letter full of advice on building an observatory and a program of astronomical study from the beginning, written in response to a letter from McCormick dated December 29, 1870, and with the benefit of Henry's recent trip to Europe which included visits to several observatories. He urges McCormick to build a physical observatory, whose "primary object is to investigate the physical phenomena of the Earth and the heavenly bodies, in contradiction to an ordinary astronomical observatory which is principally devoted to the observation and discussion of the motions of the planets and the determination of the relative positions of the fixed-stars." He also emphasizes the new opportunities for research with a physical observatory due to the application of the spectroscope and other recent inventions; the importance of the study of emanations from the sun, including light, heat, chemical, and phosphorogenic emanations; other important areas of study aided by a physical observatory, such as the magnetism of the earth and meteorology; and the vital importance of the selection of the director of the observatory. Finally he recommends Mr.[Joseph Norman?] Lockyer as a candidate for the director of such an enterprise and the University of Virginia as a site for the observatory if erected in Virginia.

            <p>Gives his advice about building a first rate observatory and comments about McCormick's plans for his observatory, suggesting "the observatory you are about to erect should be a physical one, i.e., one in which especial attention is given to observations of the physical changes in the heavenly bodies in connection with those on the earth; since it is now well established that at least the appearance of the Aurora Borealis and the alterations of the direction and force of terrestrial magnetism are connected with changes going on in the sun and it is not improbable that other terrestrial phenomena are also intimately connected with variations in the celestial bodies." He also warns that it should not be patterned after the observatories of Greenwich or Paris, or "the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">a priori</title> conceptions of an architect whatever his genius" which could absorb large amounts of the funds, pointing out that McCormick's plans contained "no provision for magnetic, photographic, or electric observations!" He also recommends that the first order of business should be the hiring of the observer, second that the instruments be procured under his directions and then the construction of the permanent building. He also furnishes an estimate of how much money would be needed for each part of his plan, and urges McCormick not to expend the bulk of the money on the building itself.
