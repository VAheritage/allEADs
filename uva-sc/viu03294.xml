        <p>The Parker collection was deposited in the Library on
            March 4, 1948, by Mr. John Crump Parker of Franklin,
            Virginia, who then made the collection a gift to the
            Library on January 3, 1980. An addition of ca. thiry items
            was given to the Library on February 5, 1951, by Mr. Parker
            and is held under Manuscripts Department number 2885-a.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Parker collection consists of ca. 5 linear shelf feet
         of papers (21 Hollinger boxes), 1874-1936, of John Crafford
         Parker, chiefly generated by his law practice and insurance
         business in Southampton County, Virginia. Parker was born in
         1862 and attended the University of Virginia Law School from
         1882 to 1884. After recieving his degree, he set up practice
         in Franklin, Virginia. He served as a member of the Virginia
         House of Delegates for Southampton County ca. 1899. He was
         elected a delegate from the Franklin Magisterial District to
         the 1904 State Democratic Convention and campaigned to have
         himself selected as delegate to the Democratic National
         Convention in St. Louis, Missouri that same year. In 1916 he
         was elected a delegate to the Democratic National Convention
         in St. Louis. In addition, Parker, a prominent Virginia
         Methodist, was a member of the General Conference's Board of
         Education of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. He died at
         the age of fifty-six in December 1918.</p>
      <p>The collection contains Parker's legal, business, and
         personal papers. The legal papers consist of case files and
         miscellaneous paper and include correspondence, legal
         documents or copies of documents, receipts, financial records,
         work sheets, notes, and sketches of property.</p>
      <p>Mr. Parker changed his insurance firm to a partnership to
         be known as J.C. Paker &amp; Sons, with his sons John Crump
         Parker and Alexander W. Parker being junior partners prior to
         1918. Some of their papers from that period and after their
         father's death appear in the collection.</p>
      <p>The legal case files chiefly concern the settlement of
         estates, including assistance to administrators and executors,
         the clarification of property rights, the formation of
         corporations, Parker's legal advisorship to a large company,
         guardianships of minors, bankruptcy, debt collection, divorce,
         and receivership. His insurance papers concern applications
         from his clients for surety bonds and fire insurance.</p>
      <p>Most of Parker's clients lived in Franklin or Southampton
         County, Virginia. The major files of legal records in the
         collection are those pertaining to B.K. Basho, Camp
         Manufacturing Company, Sallie Darden, Bessie Leigh, Martha J.
         Newman, J.D. Pretlow, the Southern Railway, the estates of
         J.D., Nannie J., and P.S. Thomas, Sallie L. Hayes, and the
         Wynne children guardianship. The case file on Camp
         Manufacturing Company, Franklin, Virginia, one of the largest
         lumber processing companies in the early part of the twentieth
         century, contains the greatest number of items.</p>
      <p>Parker's personal papers consist chiefly of his
         correspondence with relatives, friends, and political
         associates. Also included are papers concerning his work with
         the Board of Education of the Methodist Church and as
         treasurer for Southampton County. Topics mentioned in the
         personal correspondence include state and national politics,
         the Methodist Church, yellow fever in 1899, political
         difficulties in Mexico in 1913, investments in Cuba, and
         neutrality and World War I. Included in this section are
         several letters from Richard E. Byrd, speaker of the Virginia
         House of Delegates in 1912, and letters from University of
         Virginia faculty members John Barbee Minor, William Minor
         Lile, William A. Lambeth, and Raleigh C. Minor. Parker wrote
         in 1912 to L.J. Bain of the Virginia House of Delegates
         expressing his interest in establishing a university for women
         near Charlottesville. Also included are letters from John
         Stewart Bryan, William Jennings Bryan (on divisions in the
         Democratic Party in 1900), James Cannon, John Wood Fishburne,
         John Warwick Daniel, Edward Everett Holland, Eppa Hunton,
         William Atkinson Jones, J.E. McCulloch of the Southern
         Sociological Conference, Raleigh Colston Minor, Andrew Jackson
         Montague, Charles Triplett O'Ferrall, John Garland Pollard,
         Edward Watts Saunders, Henry Carter Stuart, James Hoge Tyler,
         and Henry St. George Tucker. Family correspondents include
         Parker's brothers, H.C. Parker and George H. Parker; George
         Parker's wife; Parker's sister, Jessie Mary Parker;
         sister-in-law "Nannie";and his nephew, Jesse Parker. Letters
         in the family correspondence chiefly concern personal and
         financial problems and often relate to Parker's role as the
         family's legal advisor.</p>
      <p>Also included in the collection are a postal card album, a
         nutrition notebook, bar exam coaching notes, a draft of the
         Franklin Academy Company's charter application, and ledgers
         for insurance policies, guardianship accounts, estate
         settlements, and stocks.</p>

    <arrangement>
      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>The collection is divided into two series: I. Legal Papers,
         and II. Personal and Political Papers.</p>
      <p>Series I is divided into three sub-series: A. Legal Case
         Files, arranged alphabetically; B. Miscellaneous Legal Papers,
         arranged chronologically; and C. Insurance Papers.</p>
      <p>The sub-series of Miscellaneous Legal Papers is small and
         generally consists of a chronological run of documents from
         various cases for which there are too few documents to warrant
         establishment of a case file in the Legal Case Files
         Sub-series. However, in this sub-series there are occasional
         groups of papers pertianing to the same case that have been
         drawn together in paper insert folders and filed by the date
         of the earliest item.</p>
      <p>In the Insurance Papers Sub-series the papers are divided
         between papers regarding surety bonds, which are arranged
         chronologically with case file insert folders, and paper
         regarding property insurance whihc are arranged alphabetically
         in case files. Also present in this sub-series is a bound
         volume containing a register of insurance policies and
         diagrams of buildings and the Parker sons' contract to sell
         the insurance business.</p>
      <p>In Series I, related information may be found in all three
         sub-series.</p>
      <p>Series II is divided into two sub-series: A. Correspondence
         and B. Memorabilia and Miscellaneous Papers.</p>
