      <p>This collection contains 4 letters to General Joseph E.
         Johnston plus a partial listing of the Johnston family tree, a
         treasury note, and a billfold that contains a lock of the
         general's hair. There are also 14 letters addressed to Dr.
         George Frederick Holmes and from him as well. The General
         Johnston letters cover the years 1821-1825 while the Dr.
         Holmes letters cover 1846-1885.</p>
      <p>General Joseph E. Johnston (1807-1891) was a general in the
         Confederate Army. He received his education at West Point. He
         married Lydia McLane in 1845. During the Civil War, he fought
         in the battles of First Bull Run, Fair Oaks, Vicksburg,
         Kennesaw Mountain, and Richmond. In the Battle of Kennesaw
         Mountain he defeated General William T. Sherman. After the Civil War,
         General Johnston moved to Richmond and became a member of the
         House of Representatives from 1879-81. He was also the
         commissioner of railroads from 1887 until his death in
         Washington in 1891.</p>
      <p>Connected to Johnstons by marriage was George Frederick
         Holmes. Dr. Holmes (1820-1897) was man of varied abilities. He
         was born in British Guiana while his father was stationed
         there. He moved to Britain and began his education. After one
         year at the University of Durham (England), he went to Canada
         and from there he traveled southward. When he came to
         Virginia, he married Eliza Floyd, the daughter of John Floyd,
         the then Governor of Virginia. He also spent some time farming
         in Southwestern Virginia.</p>
      <p>Dr. Holmes continued his education after he came to the
         United States. He received a degree in law from the University
         of South Carolina and then began his career as an educator. He
         was a professor of the Classics at what is now the University
         of Richmond and was named the first president of the
         University of Mississippi in 1848. He also taught at the
         College of William and Mary. Yet, he is best remembered for
         his work at the University of Virginia where he was a
         professor from 1857-1897. While at the University of Virginia,
         Dr. Holmes took on a variety of professorships. Some of these
         included: Professor of Historical Science and Professor of
         Political Economy and of the Science of Society. As a
         professor, Dr. Holmes worked on issues such as the Civil War
         and its impact on America. This pursuit lead to a special
         collection at University of Virginia named "The Memorials of
         the American Disruption". For his many years of service to the
         University of Virginia, the University named a dormitory after
         him on Brown College at Monroe Hill. Dr. Holmes spent his
         final years in Charlottesville and died there. He was buried
         Sweet Springs, Virginia, now West Virginia.</p>
