         Whitney Russell, and a brother, Frank. E. Whitney, both of

          <p>Whitney writes that he is leaving Monocacy, Maryland,
               by platform cars for Harper's Ferry, with the scenery
               "splendid by moonlight." He describes Harper's Ferry and
               continues describing the rest of the troop movements to
               Cedar Creek, five miles from Strasburg, Virginia, and
               then on to Berryville, Virginia, after General Sheridan
               learned of a "flank movement."</p>

          <p>From "In the woods near Charlestown," Whitney tells
               his mother they are engaged in building breastworks,
               with the enemy in full force in the front. "Events now
               are transpiring," he says, "which will end or prolong
               for sometime our campaign in this valley." He cautions
               his mother not to believe all reports in newspapers
               concerning fighting, as some of these are "grossly
               exaggerated."</p>

          <p>Whitney now is encamped near Berryville, where the
               enemy attacked their lines the first night after arrival
               but were forced to stop because of dark, giving Union
               troops time to build works in front of their position.
               Several skirmishes have occurred. Whitney also writes
               about Jeff, "the boy I brought from Alexandria" to
               prepare his meals.</p>

          <p>Whitney writes from picket duty near Berryville that
               thus far general engagement has been avoided, although
               he tells of a skirmish involving the 8th Corps while
               moving to their present location from Summit Point. He
               believes General Jubal Early is before them with all his
               force but does not want to attack while the camp is
               entrenched.</p>

          <p>Whitney writes his mother from his present line near
               Berryville that Union troops have been ordered to pack
               their baggage in preparation of a move. General Ulysses
               S. Grant has been in consultation with General Sheridan,
               he says, and thinks something should be done on the
               offensive. Whitney believes they may move on to winter
               quarters. He comments on the delay in his promotion, and
               says there is worry about the methods that state
               governments are using to fill depleted ranks.</p>
