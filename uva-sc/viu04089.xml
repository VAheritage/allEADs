      <p>Nancy Kilpatrick O'Brien was born in Newark, New Jersey in 1936. From
                1954-1957 she attended Massachusetts General Hospital School of Nursing
                earning her nursing degree. She became active in politics at age thirty-nine when
                she moved to Charlottesville because her husband, Dr. William O'Brien accepted a
                position in Internal Medicine at the University of Virginia. She joined the Women's
                League of Voters and was appointed Treasurer of the Thomas Jefferson Planning
                District Commission by City Council in 1973-1974, and Chairman in 1974. She
                ran for City Council and was elected first woman mayor of Charlottesville in 1976.
                She also served on many community organizations including the Jefferson School Task
                Force, the Community Development Task Force, the Advisory Committee on the South
                Rivanna Reservoir study and many housing committees. She also worked as a
                facilitator to improve the services of many community service organizations. Early
                in her political career she met Francis Fife, a former mayor of Charlottesville
                (1972-1974) who later became her second husband. She has four children.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The papers of Mayor Nancy O'Brien contain correspondence, political campaign
                information, and topical files regarding many issues that were facing the city of
                Charlottesville, Virginia from 1973 to 1981; [1982-2008]. The correspondence
                includes general correspondence, letters to the Mayor about routine issues, and
                congratulations from political figures such as Charles S. Robb, Thomas J. Michie,
                Tim Kaine, J. Kenneth Robinson, and Mark Warner. The political files include
                information about upcoming primaries. The topical files reflect O'Brien's interest
                in the community with a particular focus on the development of strong neighborhood
                communities, economic development, city annexation, city planning, housing, and
                local transportation issues. The collection contains ca. 4000 items and 22 Hollinger
                boxes which make up 9 linear feet.</p>
      <p>Specific economic issues mentioned are the construction and revitalization plan of
                the Downtown Mall, the decision to construct the Fashion Square Mall, plans for the
                Vinegar Hill area ten years after it had been destroyed and then left abandoned, and
                the designation of Fifeville as a historic neighborhood. There are also
                Charlottesville Albemarle Transportation Studies on the Meadowcreek Parkway, and
                extension of McIntire Road, Schenks Branch, and Preston Avenue. Other events
                mentioned are Queen Elizabeth's visit to Charlottesville for the bicentennial,
                racial diversity, and a sister cities program.</p>
      <p>There are also minutes and correspondence from City Council and strategies for
                sharing services between the City and the County. There are similarly joint
                committees between the City and the University of Virginia. Of particular interest
                regarding the University is a photocopy of a letter written by Thomas Jefferson
                about the opening of the University of Virginia.</p>
      <p>There are also student papers from 1983-1986 when O'Brien obtained a Masters
                degree in Public Administration at the University of Virginia (after being Mayor).
                There are also papers from when O'Brien taught planning courses (on Fifeville) at
                the University. There is a copy of her thesis (and thesis research) on Planning
                District Commissions in Virginia. (Series II UVA Graduate Student and Professor)
                There are also papers from her work as executive director of the Thomas Jefferson
                Planning Commission [1979-2006] (Series III TJPDC) and papers from her
                private work in which she acted as a facilitator for agencies that served the needs
                of the community. (Series V Facilitator) There are a few papers from her work with
                the Housing Authority.</p>
      <p>There are also minutes from the Jefferson School Task Force which was appointed by
                City Council to preserve Jefferson School as a historical institution. Included is
                information about grant funding (Bama funds from the Dave Mathews Band) and
                information about the history of Jefferson School and early African American life in
                Charlottesville. There are copies of photographs from the Rufus Holsinger
                collection. (Series IV Jefferson School)</p>
      <p>There is information on racial diversity from a group titled, "Many Races, One
                Community" which was organized by Nancy O'Brien to address racial tensions. These
                tensions had arisen in 2002 following an occurrence of violence by several African
                American Charlottesville High School students against white University of Virginia
                students. "Many Races, One Community" planned events in an attempt to unite people
                from different cultural experiences. (Series I Mayor and City Council topical files:
                Race)</p>
      <p>There are also speeches of Nancy O'Brien from 1971 to 2008 including when she was
                mayor (Series VI Speeches) and awards, certificates, and a scrapbook of newspaper
                clippings and photographs (Series VII)</p>
