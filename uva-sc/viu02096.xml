      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of correspondence, ca. 150 items,
         1861-1863, between Charles Tenney, a Union soldier from Ohio,
         and Adelaide Case, a friend from Mecca, Ohio, and three
         photographs. Tenney is a Private in Company H of the Seventh
         Ohio Regiment. The letters poignantly show the development of
         the romance between the two as Tenney participates in numerous
         engagements during the Civil War.</p>

            <p>Thirteen letters in 1861 detail Tenney's early
                  days in the war, some aboard the U.S. Steamer "Silver
                  Lake" as it traverses points along the Ohio River.
                  They include a vivid description of Piatt's (Abraham
                  Sanders) Zouaves, descriptions of the countryside, a
                  variety of interesting pictorial stationary, a
                  hanging and military movements. The end of 1861 finds
                  him in Hampshire County, Va., near Romney.</p>

              <p>Tenney is en route to Cincinnati. In his

                     battle of Carnifex Ford and the remains of Col. [
                     ]Lowe, of the 12th Ohio Regiment, who fell in
                     battle. Tenney describes feelings while engaged in
                     battle at [Coop Lanes] and mentions beauty of the
                     countryside. He also tells of meeting a steamer

                     thinks it is a sacrilege" the war will deform it.
                     Tenney also gives a vivid description of passing
                     the charred remains of the Confederate steamer
                     "Julia Moffit" and of the circumstances that sank
                     it. He says he will be glad when the war is over
                     as it is like "hitting friends," but he writes
                     that he believes firmly in continuing his

                     of heavy rains; he says the whole town like a

                     he went to aid of "Secesh" woman whose entire
                     house and furnishings were ruined with "the more

                     shot a soldier who had been making a disturbance
                     in the saloon. Tenney thinks the entire trial and
                     hanging was premature. He also says everyone is
                     having a fine time in Charleston gathering

            <p>Twenty seven letters from January through June,
                  1862 describe Tenney's movements with his regiment
                  from Romney through the Shenandoah Valley, including
                  vivid account of Battle of Kernstown in which he was
                  wounded. Tenney 's romance with Addie intensifies and
                  he proposes marriage. He describes day-to day camp
                  activities, including living conditions and cooking
                  preparations. He laments resignation from the army of
                  many Ohio officers and indicates next movement of
                  troops will be toward Fredericksburg.</p>

              <p>Tenney is near the [PawPaw] Tunnel. He muses to
                     Addie about their romance and how wearily the time
                     passes for him. He describes Washington's birthday
                     celebration the previous day with "arches of
                     evergreen, flags raised, and tents wreathed and
                     decorated in a tasteful manner." The Brigade,
                     consisting of the 7th and 29th Ohio, 110th Pa.,
                     7th Indiana and 1st Va. Regiments, was reviewed by
                     General Lander, who said the "7th is the best
                     regiment in his department." However, Tenney adds,
                     all the best officers in the regiment are
                     resigning and going home. Tenney thinks
                     resignations are due to the fact that the regiment
                     head, Maj. Gen. Erastus Barnard Tyler, is a
                     "ruined and unprincipled head."</p>

                  Va., then on an incursion into Maryland, and finally
                  to Harper's Ferry. Along the way he participates with
                  his regiment in the battles at Cedar Mountain,
                  Antietam and South Mountain. The letters contain many

                  for cooking, his opinions of generals and newspapers.

                     Harper's Ferry the most disgraceful thing of the
                     campaign. He talks of General Geary's taking
                     command at Harper's Ferry and describes General
                     Green as being "very cool and collected in the
                     field" at Antietam. Tenney comments on the
                     Emancipation Proclamation, discusses attempts by
                     Union Army to cut off Confederates from Richmond
                     and indicates disdain for England's recognition of
                     Confederate States.</p>

                     promotion to Colonel. He describes an 8 by 10-foot
                     log house he and others are building for
                     accommodations. Tenney also gives a lengthy
                     description of why General Pope was defeated on
                     the Rappahannock, including a character analysis
                     of Pope and the Southern Generals Jackson and

              <p>Tenney writes a tender letter with Addie's
                     portrait placed on his Bible. As his regiment
                     proceeds to Hillsborough presumably to prevent the
                     enemy from leaving the Valley, Tenney remains in
                     camp because of an illness. He quotes his favorite
                     lines of Byron, but returns to politics by giving
                     thanks that the Vallandigham (Clement Laird) has
                     been defeated in run for Governor of Ohio. Tenney
                     decries political influence at the War Department
                     and its impact on Union Generals' movements,
                     saying "It has almost ruined our Republic."</p>

                  Springs and White Sulphur Springs, and another

                  Tenney kept from January through the middle of May
                  1862. The papers, bound together by thread, deal
                  primarily with an account of troop movements, most of
                  which are described in greater detail in his frequent
                  letters to Adelaide Case. Stationary on which the
                  journal is written includes many colorful Union
                  drawings, quotations and some poetry. In an entry
                  dated May 4, he also gives an interesting description
                  of a visit to "The Harrison Cave," a beautiful grotto
                  near Harrisonburg, Va., which is by way of being
                  spoiled because so many visitors are breaking off

            <p>Fourteen letters written in 1861 convey the
                  tentative beginnings of Adelaide's romance with
                  Charles Tenney. She appears to be hesitant to become
                  too involved and urges him to think of her as a
                  "loving sister." Addie describes her devoted
                  relationship with her brother Hal, who also is in the
                  service. She tells Charles of activities in the town
                  of Mecca, Ohio since both he and Hal have left.</p>

                     had agreed to correspond with Charlie came from
                     the remark he made before leaving, "My home is not

                     letter from Charlie since September. She tells of
                     a gentleman caller named James Beebe whom she
                     detests, and she relates amusing story about his
                     call. Addie also laments the evils of slavery.</p>

            <p>Thirty-two letters from Addie to Charlie from
                  January- June 1862 describe the deepening
                  relationship between the two, with Addie accepting
                  Charles' proposal of marriage and admitting deep
                  protestations of love for him. During this period,
                  the two finally exchange portraits of each other.
                  Addie also starts school teaching in East Claridon,
                  Ohio, and writes often of her experiences, including
                  reading of the Bible to her pupils, problems of
                  discipline and the interesting times she has
                  "boarding out" with various families. Addie comments
                  often on the war, particularly the Battle of
                  Winchester, in which Charlie received a slight wound,
                  and describes some of the women's activities to help
                  on the home front.</p>

            <p>In twenty-eight letters between July and December
                  1862, Addie talks often of her deep love of Charlie.
                  The war is intensifying, and she often has opinions
                  of various battles--Culpeper, Chambersburg,
                  Sharpsburg- -and many Generals--McClellan, Pope,
                  McDowell. Sadly, toward the end of the year, she
                  learns of Charlie's deteriorating health and often
                  expresses her grave concern, writing at one time that
                  her life would be a "wilderness" if Charlie did not

                     to the failure of McClellan to bring up his troops
                     because they "were too demoralized to trust them
                     on the field." Addie adds that her school closes
                     "next week."</p>

                  or 1862, Addie is visiting her Aunt and chit chats
                  about family matters. In one marked the 17th, Addie
                  describes life at home and her desire to read Pope's
                  translation of Homer's "Iliad;" in a partial note she
                  comments on Catholicism and wonders why they are not

                  letter contains family news and a description of her
                  Father's love for her, and another gives an account
                  of telling her Father about Charles' marriage
                  proposal and "seeing him weep."</p>
