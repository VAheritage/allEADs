        <p>The Grinnan Family Papers were a gift to the Library by

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This addition to the Grinnan Family Papers consists of ca.
         1800 items (9 Hollinger boxes and one oversize folder, ca. 3.1
         linear shelf feet), 1773, 1789, 1802(1843-1937)1981, chiefly
         correspondence, newspaper clippings, scrapbooks, manuscripts,
         photographs, financial and legal items, and other related
         material pertaining to the Grinnan family of "Brampton",
         Madison Mills, Madison County, Virginia, and associated
         Coalter, Bryan, Duryea, Glassell and Tucker families.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the collection consists of papers relating to
         the Rev. Dr. Randolph Bryan Grinnan (1860-1942). He was a son
         of Dr. Andrew Glassel Grinnan and Georgia Screven Bryan and
         was born at "Brampton" on April 21, 1860. He attended
         Hampden-Sydney College from 1876-1878, the University of
         Virginia, 1878-1880, 1881-1882, and Union Theological
         Seminary, 1882-1885. After being ordained as a Presbyterian
         minister in 1885, Grinnan went to Japan where he served as a
         missionary from 1885-1898. He lived and worked in Kobe, Kochi,
         Nagasaki, and other Japanese cities. In 1886, he married Lena
         Leete in Tokyo; after her death in 1893, Martha Estelle Duryea
         (in 1896). Hampden-Sydney College conferred a Doctor of
         Divinity degree on Grinnan in 1897. He returned to the United
         States a year later. He served as pastor of Woodland Church,
         Louisville, Kentucky, 1899-1902; 1912-1916; and Colley
         Memorial Church, Norfolk, Virginia, 1916-1936. He died on July
         21, 1942. His papers reflect his life and career but contain
         mostly letters to him from various members of his family and
         acquaintances, especially his father and his son, Dr. Randolph
         Bryan Grinnan (1907-). There are a few letters from Grinnan
         during his service in Japan in which he describes not only his
         own activities, but Japanese life and customs as well. Also
         present are his scrapbooks, notebooks, a diary, various
         articles written by him regarding Japan, and various other
         items including his University of Virginia certificates,
         newspapers clippings and other related items. Further
         information regarding Grinnan's work in Japan can be found in

         Japan</title>by Robert Leroy Hilldrup in the University of
         Virginia Rare Book Department.</p>

         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Alabama.</title>His accounts are
         interesting for the descriptions he gives of the unpleasant
         side of army life: lice, desertions, looting of dead bodies,
         depriciated currency, high prices and scarce goods, and
