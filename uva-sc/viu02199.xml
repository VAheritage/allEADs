      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 291,000 items (194 cubic
         boxes; 2 card trays and 1 oversize folder; ca. 245 linear
         shelf feet) ca. 1965-1974, and contains papers pertaining to
         the political career of William B. Spong, Jr. (1920- ) of
         Portsmouth, Virginia, in the United States Senate, including
         campaign material, legislative files, speeches and news
         releases, correspondence, daily carbons, printed material,
         photographs, casework files, reel-to-reel tape recordings,
         videotape, constituent correspondence, research material, and
         bound volumes.</p>
      <p>Decisions concerning the processing and retention of
         individual files were made by the Curator based upon the
         recommendations in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Records Management Handbook for United
         States Senators and Their Repositories</title>by Karen Dawley
         Paul, Archivist Senate Historical Office.</p>
      <p>The first and largest series contains legislative files and
         are arranged alphabetically according to the Senate Committee
         System of the [then]seventeen standing committees with a small
         section based on legislation generated by special, select,
         &amp; joint committees. These standing committees include:
         Aeronautical and Space Sciences; Agriculture and Forestry;
         Appropriations; Armed Services; Banking, Housing and Urban
         Affairs; Commerce; District of Columbia; Finance; Foreign
         Relations; Government Operations; Interior and Insular
         Affairs; Judiciary; Labor and Public Welfare; Post Office and
         Civil Service; Public Works; Rules and Administration; and
         Veteran's Affairs.</p>
      <p>Spong served on the following committees and
         subcommittees:</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">1967-1968</emph><lb/>Committee on Banking &amp; Currency: Subcommittees on
         International Finance, Production: Stabilization, Securities,
         Small Business. 
         <lb/>Committee on the District of Columbia - Fiscal Affairs
         (Chairman). 
         <lb/>Committee on Public Works: Subcommittees on Air &amp;
         Water Pollution, Pubic Roads, Special Subcommittee on Economic
         Development.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">1969-1970</emph><lb/>Committee on Commerce: Subcommittees on Consumer
         Engergy: Natural Resources &amp; the Environment, Merchant
         Marine. 
         <lb/>Committee on the District of Columbia - Fiscal Affairs:
         Subcommittee on Public Health, Education, &amp; Safety
         (Chairman). 
         <lb/>Committee on Public Works: Subcommittees on Air &amp;
         Water Pollution, Public Roads, Special Subcommittee on
         Economic Development.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">1971-1972</emph><lb/>Committee on Commerce: Subcommittees on Aviation,
         Consumer, Environment, Merchant Marine, Oceans &amp;
         Atmosphere. 
         <lb/>Committee on Foreign Relations: Subcommittees on
         European Affairs, Oceans: International Environment, Western
         Hemisphere Affairs. 
         <lb/>Select Committee on Equal Education Opportunities. 
         <lb/>Select Committee on Standards &amp; Conduct.</p>
      <p>Each committee has a file at the beginning with more
         general correspondence before the files with subheadings which
         warrant a separate folder. Many of the files with subheadings
         often have related and earlier material in the general files
         so it is best to also consult these to make sure no material
         pertaining to a research topic is missed. The legislative
         files contain a mixture of constituent correspondence,
         correspondence with fellow legislators and legislative
         research material and memoranda.</p>
      <p>The 
         <emph render="bold">second series</emph>consists of the 
         <emph render="bold">federal files</emph>containing files
         pertaining to the various federal departments, agencies,
         boards, and commissions which make up the major components of
         the Executive Branch of the Government. This series contains a
         mixture of correspondence from representatives of government
         agencies, constituents, and other legislators. There are also
         two much smaller subseries of independent agencies of the
         Judicial Branch and the Legislative Branch, including the
         Supreme Court, Tax Court, General Accounting Office,
         Government Printing Office, Library of Congress, etc.</p>
      <p>The 
         <emph render="bold">third series</emph>contains 
         <emph render="bold">general files</emph>pertaining to the
         state of Virginia, Virginia and national politics,
         administrative office files, files pertaining to public
         activities such as awards, chairmanships and memberships,
         public relations files, and campaign files for both 1966 and
         1972 (for additional files on these campaigns see the guide

      <p>The last group of files in the third series is entitled " 
         <emph render="bold">VIP Correspondence</emph>." This
         designation was created by the staff of Special Collections to
         preserve letters from notable correspondents in files not
         otherwise deemed of permanent historical value and was not
         part of the original arrangement. These letters were culled
         from files such as courtesy, congratulations, gifts,
         greetings, and requests. For lists of these correspondents
         please see the folder listing for Cubic 162 at the end of the
         guide. The term "notable correspondent" in this case was
         limited to those individuals chiefly involved with politics
         and government.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Daily carbons ("yellows")</emph>of the
         correspondence of Senator Spong's office comprises the fourth
         series of files, arranged alphabetically by name of
         correspondent by the years 1967- 1970, 1971, and 1972. The
         last and 
         <emph render="bold">fifth series</emph>consists of such
         miscellaneous material as reel-to-reel tape recordings, video
         tape, oversize items, and two boxes of 5 x 8 index card files.
         One box of 5 x 8 cards is the alphabetical by year topical
         index to Spong's speeches, statements, and press releases,
         which are arranged in chronological order under the heading
         Public Relations - Speeches in the third series. The other box
         of cards appears to be an index to legislation and amendments
         introduced in Congress during 1974-1976.</p>

      <head>Organization</head>
      <p>The collection is arranged in five series based upon the
         original order imposed by Spong's office staff with the
         addition of two series at the end for the daily carbons and
         miscellaneous materials. The folders are generally in reverse
         chronological order except for the speeches and press releases
         in the General Series. The Ivystax box numbers are included in
