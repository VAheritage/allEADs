      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>William Cabell Rives (1792 or 1793-1868) was born in
         Amherst County, Virginia. After attending Hampden-Sydney
         College he graduated from the College of William and Mary in
         1809; ten years later he married Judith Page Walker. In 1814
         he was admitted ot the Virginia bar and served as aide-de-camp
         to General John Hartwell Cocke. He represented Nelson County
         in the Virginia Consitutional Convention of 1816, Albermarle
         County in the House of Delegates in 1822, and was a member of
         the U.S. House of Representatives from Alberarle County in the
         18th and 20th Congresses. Rives was also a minister to France,
         1829-1832 and 1849-1852. He later served as a senator from
         Virginia, 1832-1845, as a member of the Peace Convention in
         1861 in Washington, D.C., and as a member of the Provisional
         and Second Confederate Congresses, 1861-1862. He retired to
         "Castle Hill" in 1863 and died there five years later.</p>
      <p>Judith Page Walker Rives (1802-1882) was born at "Castle
         Hill," Virginia on March 24, 1802, and she married William
         Cabell Rives in 1819. "Castle Hill" and 3,800 acres of land
         were inherited by her shortly before her marriage.</p>
      <p>Alfred Landon Rives (1830-1903), the son of William and
         Judith Rives, was born in Paris, France, while his father was
         U.S. Minister to that country. After returning with his family
         to the United States, he studied at home under private tutors
         and later attended Concord Academy, the Virginia Military
         Institute, and the University of Virginia, where he remained
         for only one semester. After his father's reappointment as
         minister to France he studied at the École
         National des Ponts et Chaussées, the government
         engineering school. Following his graduation in 1854 he was
         employed by the Virginia Midland Railway and later, by the
         United States Engineering Corps. He was appointed to Robert
         McClelland, Secretary of the Interior under President Franklin
         Pierce, to work on several projects including the Washington
         Aqueduct. During the Civil War Rives served the Confederacy as
         acting chief of the Engineering Bureau; after the war he
         became division engineer of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad.
         He was selected by General William T. Sherman on behalf of the
         Khedive of Egypt as chief engineer for that country, but
         declined the offer. During the years 1873-1897 he was employed
         by various railroad companies and worked in several states and
         foreign countries. Rives retired in 1897 but later resumed his
         career by serving as the chief engineer of the Cape Cod Canal
         Company and as vice-president of the Vera Cruz and Pacific
         Railroad Company. He held both positions at the time of his
         death on February 27, 1903 at "Castle Hill."</p>
      <p>Amélie Rives Troubetzkoy (1863-1945), the
         daughter of Alfred Landon and Sadie MacMurdo Rives, was born
         in Richmond, Virginia on August 23, 1863. She was educated by
         private tutors, and married John Armstrong Chaloner, later a
         well-known Virginia eccentric, in 1888. After their divorce,
         she married Prince Pierre Troubetzkoy, a Russian artist, in
         1896. A noted author, she published several novels, plays,
         poems, and short stories.</p>
