      <head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Thomas Taylor Hammond, a distinguished professor of history emeritus of the University of Virginia, a specialist in Russian and Slavic studies, an astute observer and researcher of communist revolutions and
post World War II Soviet expansion initiatives, a prolific author and lecturer, a skilled photographer and an active civil rights advocate was born on September 15, 1920, in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Percy
Waters (a journalist) and Elizabeth (Denman) Hammond.
</p>
      <p>Hammond was educated at the University of Mississippi (B.A., 1941) and took graduate studies in economics at the University of North Carolina (M.A., 1943). After serving in the Navy in the Pacific in World War
II, he taught history at Emory University in Atlanta, and served as assistant professor of history at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Hammond then continued graduate work in Russian History Studies at
Columbia University's Russian Institute (M.A. 1948, Ph.D., 1954).
</p>
      <p>At the time when Hammond was completing his work at the Russian Institute, Dumas Malone, who was a friend and who was then teaching at Columbia, arranged an interview for him for a position at the University of
Virginia in Charlottesville that led to his appointment in 1949 as assistant professor in the department of history.
</p>
      <p>Over the period of the next 42 years, Hammond taught courses on Soviet history and Soviet foreign policy. He rose to full professor in 1963, and became identified as the University's first Russian specialist.
His concerted efforts at expanding research and faculty involvement in his area of study, led to his founding and directing a Center for Russian and Slavic Studies at the University in the mid-1960's. At that
time, he also served as president of the Southern Conference of Slavic Studies (1964-1965) and, in later years, president of the Conference on Slavic and East European History (1982-1983).
</p>
      <p>Hammond was also the holder of many fellowships including the Fulbright, Guggenheim, Carnegie, Ford and Rockefeller Foundations. He was a featured speaker at numerous scholarly conferences and he lectured at
the Military Academy at West Point, the Naval War College, the State Department's Foreign Service Institute and at many local and state-wide civic and educational organizations.
</p>
      <p>Hammond did comprehensive research in his field of study on his many visits outside of the United States. He traveled extensively throughout the USSR and Eastern Europe during the period of the Cold War doing
research at the Moscow University and interviewing people in all walks of life. As a skillful photographer, he compiled a massive collection of photo slides, many of which he used to illustrate his lectures and
some of which he incorporated in his articles written for the National Geographic Magazine in September, 1959, ("A First Look at the Soviet Union") and in March, 1966, ("An American in Moscow").
</p>
      <p>The publication of Hammond's writings appeared in journals such as Foreign Affairs, Slavic Review, American History Review, Orbis, and Political Science Quarterly and in numerous other journals in which he
published over 100 book reviews. In 1976, Hammond won a Phi Beta Kappa Prize for the best scholarly work by a faculty member at the University of Virginia for his book, The Anatomy of Communist Takeovers, which he
edited. His other books include: Yugoslavia Between East and West, Lenin on Trade Unions and Revolution and Red Flag Over Afghanistan: The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan and its Consequences. He was also editor of
Soviet Foreign Relations and World Communism, A Selected, Annotated Bibliography of 7,000 Books in 30 Languages and Witnesses to the Origins of the Cold War.
</p>
      <p>In addition to his scholarly work, Hammond was an active participant in university and departmental activities. He served on a multitude of committees including: Scholarship, Athletics, Non-Western Studies,
Undergraduates, Foreign Students, Fulbright Fellowships and Truman Scholarships. He served on the University President's Special Search Committees, was Secretary of the Academic Faculty for six years and was a
member of all of the Department of History Committees at one time or another.
</p>
      <p>During the critical civil rights period in the 1950's and 1960's, Hammond was a force for helping smooth the process of racial integration. With Paul Gaston, he helped found the Martin Luther King Chapter of
the Council on Human Relations to recruit black students and faculty and to eliminate discrimination. This effort was also carried over into the local community where Hammond served as president of the
Charlottesville Chapter of the Council on Human Relations and as a member of the Executive Committee of the local branch of the NAACP, promoting social justice in local schools, parks and other facilities.
</p>
      <p>On February 11, 1993, after having suffered a stroke, Hammond died in Charlottesville Virginia. He was survived by his widow Nancy, his son, Thomas Kent,and his stepchildren, Andrea Fritch Parle and Vernon
Craig Fritch.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The papers of Thomas Taylor Hammond, a distinguished professor of history (professor emeritus) from the University of Virginia, and a specialist in Russian and Slavic studies, contain ca. 4,000 items, (30
Hollinger boxes, 1 cubic box and 155 linear feet). The collection spans the time that he taught at the University, 1949-1992.
</p>
      <p>The papers are organized into eight series: Series I contains publications written by Hammond. Series II has background source materials (articles, lecture notes, scholarly papers and news clippings) used for
teaching. Series III has course handouts and packets of reading material for students. There are also two course packets belonging to Professor Sablinsky's courses Hieu 244 : Russia From Peter the Great to 1917 in
the fall of 1986 and 1987. Series IV includes copies of exams that Hammond wrote for his courses. Series V includes scholarly papers written by others. Series VI contains student papers which are restricted.
Series VII includes handouts and brochures that he gave to students to teach them how to research, apply for grants and become published. Series VIII deals with the correspondence of Professor Hammond.
</p>
      <p>Included in Series I, publications by Hammond, are eighteen articles that he wrote for many scholarly and international journals such as the Political Science Quarterly, Survey, Orbis, Foreign Affairs and the
Journal of International Affairs. Also included are two articles in the National Geographic: "First Hand Look at the Soviet Union" (September 1959) and "An American in Moscow" (March 1966). There is also an
article in the University of Virginia Alumni News, "The Outster of Khrushchev and Its Consequences" (May-June 1965). There are also many papers by Hammond dating from 1949 to 1984.
</p>
      <p>In series II there are articles and publications that Hammond collected for his teaching. Topics include every aspect of Russian life from culture (music, theatre and ballet), family values, economics and
alcoholism to more political aspects such as, Russia's relationships with the rest of the world; political leaders; political change and influence; Bolsheviks; revolution; black market; espionage; cold war; the
Cuban missile crisis and many more subjects. Some scholarly papers are included with the articles if the topics covered in the paper are closely related.
</p>
      <p>Alongside the folders of articles in Hammond's source material are folders of lecture notes on subjects that he taught. His notes show that he reviewed his lectures and tried to improve his teaching by studying
what worked well in the classroom and how a topic could be shortened, lengthened or omitted to help students better understand the concepts that he taught.
</p>
      <p>In series III there are hand-outs and course packets (reading material) for the following courses (Box 22 and 23): Hieu 189; Hieu 244 #1; Hieu 244 #2; Hieu 383/583 (#1); Hieu 383/583 (#2); Hieu 384/584; Hieu
583 ; Hist 384/584 (#1); Hist 384/584 (#2) Hist 487/488; Hist 384/584/586; Hist 488; Hist 488K; and Hist 488R.
</p>
      <p>There are also lecture notes from Hammond's First Year Seminar: The Russian Revolution and miscellaneous articles. Also included in this series are outline notes from Professor Woodford "Woody" McClellan.
</p>
      <p>Series IV consists of master copies of exam questions that Hammond wrote for many of his courses. He has added notes on many of the exam copies indicating if the test was too hard or how he might change it in
the future.
</p>
      <p>Series V of the collection includes professional papers that were written by scholars for various conferences. The papers in Box 25 and 26 are organized by the name of the conferences. There are additional
papers written by scholars where the name of the conference is unknown. These are organized by the title of the papers. (Box 27)
</p>
      <p>The Conferences include: Academic Committee on Soviet Jewry, Discussion at the Academy of Sciences, Air Force Intelligence Conference on Soviet Affairs, Annual Meeting of the American Political Science
Association, Dominant Powers and Subordinate States Conference, Hoover Conference: "Fifty Years of Communism", Institute for the Study of the USSR, Kennan Institute Conference Paper on "USSR and Marxist
Revolutions", Nationalism and the Soviet Union Conference: Implications for the Future, Proceedings of the Low-Intensity Warfare Conference, Research Conference on Communist Revolutions, Seminar on "Soviet
National Security Decision Making", Southern Conference on Slavic Studies (5th Annual, Soviet Policy in the Third World Conference, St. Antony's College-Oxford Conference, and the Subcomittee on the Far East and

</p>
      <p>Series VI consists of student papers including one by Charles Evans, the donor for this collection. The papers are graded and have restricted access.
</p>
      <p>Series VII contains advice on teaching and research that Professor Hammond provided for students through hand-outs and brochures.
</p>
      <p>Series VIII contains some correspondence of Professor Hammond. There is miscellaneous correspondence such as a letter from Hammond to an unknown recipient about ordering a dissertation "The Rise and Fall of the
Bela Kun Regime 1919" by Frank Eckelt as well as a reference to personal information about his wife and her family in Prague; a letter from Fred Pryor of Swartmore College about speaking at a conference; and an
invitation to an undergraduate mixer. There is also correspondence between Hammond and his assistant Charles Evans and a letter of reference for Evans.
