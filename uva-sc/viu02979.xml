He continues later, "I could not reconcile to my feelings going in direct opposition to the wishes of your Grand Father and his prejudices against Chappell Hill appear invincible."  He instructs Francis to attend to his learning, and that "four years only are left [him] for the acquisition of every thing necessary to render [him] a respectable and useful member of society."

          <p>Thanking him for his prompt reply to her letter, defending male gallantry, and expostulating on the inadequacy of writing when compared to speech.  Mentions the recent guests at Monticello for the "meeting of the Visitors of the University [of Virginia]." Additionally, discusses the recent departure of [Thomas] Sully "the great portrait painter" who has been commissioned by the West Point Academy to paint a portrait of Grand papa [Thomas Jefferson], and commending his work, stating, "the upper part of the face is perfect, the eye is so full of life that you almost expect to see it roll. He is the first painter who has ever succeeded in catching the expression of Grandpapa's countenance, and rendering that mixture of dignity &amp; benevolence which prevail in it. If the copy is as good as the original (for a full length portrait is required, and Sully carried away with him simply the head and neck on a small bit of canvas) it will probably be the best representation existing of one to whom further ages must look back with gratitude and admiration. This portrait is defective about the mouth &amp; skin, but the painter seems to be aware of this defect, and will endeavor to correct it." She later mentions that "Grandpapa is well and as usual intent on the University [of Virginia], [which]? will be ready for you I dare say in eighteen years if you care [for a little]? delay, or maybe in seven-in good truth, I do not believe those 'potent grave and reverend signors,' the Visitors, know themselves when this great work is to go into operation."

          <p>Regarding her anxiety about a fever among Elizabeth's slaves, yet stating, "I know it is contrary to experience to suppose that a fever of this kind beginning among the negroes will extend to the white family." Also concerning the preoccupation of the ladies with which she is acquainted with marriage, but claims "for my part, I am more thoroughly disgusted with mankind at this time than I ever was before and the 'blessed estate of matrimony' never stood before me so openly in its deformity." She also details the situation at Monticello, where most of the furniture has been removed, and that "the house is really like a great hotel and the impertinence of people is beyond endurance." She later continues, "You have no idea how desolate the old place looks.  The lawn is quite grown up with weeds and young trees, and the whole establishment has a wild untended appearance which is quite melancholy. Within doors all has changed.  The girls occupy but a corner of the house, and that corner without furniture, and without servants. There really are not persons to carry on the business of a family, and I forsee trouble without end to Virginia [Jefferson Randolph]."
