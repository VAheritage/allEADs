               own charge, making no part of the family, and receiving
               nothing from it in any way whatever. He will come on no
               other terms; &amp; he assures Mr. T. that there shall be
               no other communication than the sight of him as he goes
               in and out. He wants only a place for his horse; the
               cellar under the house; one of the carriage houses for
               his fuel which he will procure himself; and a small spot
               for a garden, to be enclosed by him." Trist gives him
               permission to live there and invites him to do so as one
               of the family, but Randolph replys that his own peace of
               mind requires an absolute separation from the others at

               Jefferson's determination to leave Virginia and go to

               his farm, and the prejudice of the Methodist and
