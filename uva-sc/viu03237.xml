      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>These papers, 1939-1948, of Atcheson Laughlin Hench as a
         member of the School Board of the City of Charlottesville,
         consist of ca. 665 items, including correspondence, memoranda,
         reports, meeting dockets, and related material. Hench served
         for many years on the Curriculum and Personnel Committees, and
         worked closely with the Committees on Educational Facilities
         for Negroes and on the Office of Superintendent and the
         Special Committee to Investigate Conditions at Jefferson High
         School.</p>
      <p>Hench (December 31, 1891-August 9, 1974) received his B.A.,
         1912 from Lafayette College and his M.A., 1917, and Ph.D.,
         1921, from Harvard University. After teaching for brief
         periods at Lafayette College, Pennsylvania Military College,
         and Wesleyan University, he came to the University of Virginia
         as an associate professor. In 1925 he became a full professor,
         and married Virginia Bedinger Michie. He held the Linden Kent
         Memorial Chair as Professor of English from 1940 until his
         retirement in 1962, when he was made professor emeritus; he
         served as chairman of the Department of English from
         1951-1954.</p>
      <p>Specific topics of interest include the opening of Lane
         High School (as the new white high school) in 1940,
         petitioning for equalization of salaries for blacks and whites
         in the school system, and conflicts between the principal and
         teachers at Jefferson High School during 1945-1946. General
         school board material covers the school budgets, teachers'
         salaries, Miller School applicants, activities and programs of
         the schools, statistics on students, and the schools' war
         activities. As a member of the Committee of Admission to
         Miller School, a standing committee of the School Board, Hench
         was involved in the process of accepting applicants for
         enrollment into Miller School, the Albermarle County military
         prepatory school.</p>
