      <head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Tibor Wlassics was born in 1936 to an aristocratic and well-educated family in
                Hungary. After secondary school, he was forbidden to attend the University because
                of the communist take-over and his family ties to the aristocracy. He worked as a
                laborer but was able to find work as a translator due to his linguistic abilities.
                In 1956 he began his Italian studies at the University in Genoa, Italy. He married
                Luciana Giovannetti and accepted a job with his uncle who was a chemist in Rhode
                Island. He attended Columbia University, settled in New Brunswick and received his
                doctorate in 1967. Dr. Wlassics then obtained a position at the University of
                Pittsburgh, where he was promoted to Full Professor. In 1981 he became Visiting
                Professor at the University of Virginia, and was offered a permanent position in the
                Department of Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese the following year. In 1988 he was
                named the William R. Kenan Chair for Italian Studies. He recreated the B. A. program
                and established an M. A. program in Italian Studies. He wrote more than one hundred
                articles and was an expert on authors such as Alighieri Dante, Galileo Galilei,
                Giovanni Verga, and Cesare Pavese. In 1986 Tibor Wlassics was awarded a Guggenheim
                Fellowship and in 1989 the Torquato Tasso Prize from the Academy of Sciences of
                Bergamo, Italy, for his study on Galileo. He lectured in America and Europe and
                organized the Lectura Dantis lecture series for scholars all over the world. He
                edited the Lectura Dantis, and facilitated the Tenth Annual International Congress
                of Italian Studies at the University of Virginia. He was a powerful force in the
                field of Italian Studies in the United States. In 1997 the American Association of
                Italian Studies elected Tibor Wlassics as its Honorary President. Tibor was also
                adored by his students for his interesting and witty stories and his "difficult
                quizzes" that were given every day. His wife, Luciana Wlassics earned her library
                degree at the University of Pittsburgh and became a beloved member of the senior
                cataloging staff at the University of Virginia Library. (Source of biography is
                based on information from William R. Kenan Professor of Spanish, Javier Herrero)</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection contains the papers of Tibor Wlassics, the William R. Kenan Professor
                of Italian Studies at the University of Virginia from 1981 to 1998. The collection
                is composed of course readings, quizzes, and translation exercises from his classes
                in Italian and Italian Literature. There is also worldwide correspondence from
                colleagues at other universities offering support for Professor Wlassics Masters
                Program in Italian at the University of Virginia. There are also student evaluations
                in which the students expressed how much they liked the story telling, and humor
                that Wlassics used in his teaching methods. The courses were taught using Italian
                Literature such as Alighieri Dante's "Inferno," "La Suora Giovane;" La Novella del
                Buon Vecchio e della bella fanciulla;" "Gli Indifferenti;" "La Casa in Collina;" "Da
                Pascoli a Sanguineti: Antologia della poesia del Novecento;" (Opere consulatate;
                Introduzione biografica; Gli interpreti del Tasso; Temi e problem della critica)
                "Leggere Verga;" Dante's Divine Comedy Introductory Readings; "Difesa Dell' Orlando
                Furioso Dell Ariosto;"and Italian College textbooks compiled by Tibor Wlassics. The
                compilation of his own grammar books and Italian textbooks, the articles that he
                wrote, along with the collection of articles for his classes, which were often
                hand-pasted onto paper and photocopied show the enormous time and passion that
                Professor Wlassics gave to his students and his profession. The collection is 356
                items, 6 hollinger boxes, and 2.5 linear feet.</p>
