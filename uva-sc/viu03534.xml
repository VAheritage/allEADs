      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Breckinridge-Bouldin Collection consists of a .3 shelf
         feet (45 items) of letters, papers, bound volumes, and
         newspaper clippings, 1751 (1832-1907) pertaining to Robert
         Breckinridge of Augusta County and the Bouldin family of
         Charlotte County, and Danville, Virginia. The earliest dated
         item in this accession is a list of tax delinquents in Augusta
         County, Virginia, for the year 1750 compiled by Robert
         Breckinridge in November 1751. Breckinridge was a justice and
         later sheriff in Augusta, served on the frontier from
         1759-1761, and was one of the first trustees of Staunton. He
         was married, first, to Mary Poague, and second, to Lettice
         Preston, and died in Botetourt County in 1772. The rest of the
         collection pertains to the Bouldin family of Charlotte County,
         and Danville, Virginia. A bound volume containing letters,
         1823-1853, written by James Wood Bouldin to his wife, his
         brother Louis C. Bouldin, Esquire (Bouldin) appended this
         title to his name), his sister Francinia Bouldin, his sons
         Louis C., Robert, and Powhatan Bouldin, and his daughter Alice
         L. McCargo, bears a dedication from Powhatan Bouldin to his
         son. Born in Charlotte County, Virginia, in 1792, James Wood
         Bouldin was the son of Major Wood Bouldin and Joanna Tyler
         Bouldin. He practiced law, was elected as a Jacksonian
         Democrat to succeed Thomas T. Bouldin in the twenty-third
         Congress, and was re-elected to two succeeding terms, serving
         from March 1834 to March 1839. Resuming the practice of law
         and farming after he left Congress, Bouldin died at "Forest
         Hill," his home in Charlotte County, on March 30, 1854. In a
         series of letters, 1823-1837, to his brother Louis C. Bouldin,
         Esquire, James discusses family and business affairs, and to a
         lesser extent national politics. He offers his brother advice
         and encouragement, and speaks of his own personal misfortune,
         including the death of two wives. In a number of letters
         written in 1843 and 1844 to his wife (apparently his third;
         her name is unknown) his sister Francinia Bouldin, and his
         sons Robert and Powhatan, Bouldin describes his travels and
         business in New Orleans and various towns in Mississippi. He
         comments on the scenery, the climate, the populace, the
         progress of his business, his physical and spiritual health,
         and various religious services that he had attended. A final
         group of letters, in 1848 and 1849, are from Bouldin to his
         sons, Louis, at the University of Virginia, and Powhatan, at
         Virginia Military Institute. Bouldin urges his sons to study
         hard, discourses at length on the benefits of an education,
         and offers general fatherly advice. He also discusses family
         matters, slavery, and politics. In a letter of March 11, 1853,
         Bouldin writes to his daughter Alice L. McCargo, informing her
         of the death of her brother Robert in California. In addition
         to the letters, the volume contains extracts of essays by
         Macaulay and others. There are also loosely bound copies of
         extracts of several of Bouldin's letters for 1849. Completing
         the collection is a bound volume, 1874-1907, of newspaper
         clippings from the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Danville Times</title>, principally for
         the year 1894, kept by Powhatan Bouldin, editor of that paper.
         The topics of the clippings, largely of local interest, are
         political, racial, practical, and humorous in nature. A few
         loose newspaper clippings and recipes have been placed in a
         folder.</p>
