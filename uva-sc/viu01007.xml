      <head>Blair and Woodbury Families--Biographical
         Information</head>
      <p>Montgomery Blair, lawyer and statesman, was born in
         Franklin County, Kentucky on May 10, 1813 and died in Silver
         Spring, Maryland, on July 27, 1883. He was appointed to West
         Point in 1831 by President Jackson; after his graduation in
         1835 he received a lieutenancy in the army in time to serve in
         the Seminole War. The following year he resigned his
         commission in order to study law at Transylvania University.
         He settled in St. Louis, Missouri in 1837 and began practicing
         law; he was appointed U. S. district attorney for Missouri but
         removed for political reasons by President Tyler. He served as
         mayor of St. Louis, 1842-1843, and as judge of the court of
         common pleas, 1845-1849. He resigned in 1849 to resume his law
         practice, and in 1852 moved to Maryland where he practiced law
         chiefly before the Supreme Court of the United States. In
         1855, President Pierce made him the first solicitor in the
         court of claims in the U. S. but President Buchanan dismissed
         him in 1858 because of his pronounced views on slavery. He
         gained prestige among anti- slavery people when he acted as
         counsel for the plaintiff in the celebrated Dred Scott case;
         he helped secure a defense attorney for John Brown after the
         Harper's Ferry incident. He was appointed postmaster general
         in 1861 by President Lincoln, and while in office, organized
         the postal system for the army, introduced compulsory payment
         of postage and free delivery in cities, improved the registry
         system, established the railway post office, organized the
         postal draft plan, stopped the franking privileges of
         postmasters, and was instrumental in bringing about the Postal
         Union Convention at Paris in 1863. After resigning from
         Lincoln's cabinet, he continued to loyally work for Lincoln.
         He believed in Lincoln's plan of reconstruction, and decried
         the disenfranchisement of the Southern whites and
         enfranchisement of the negroes. During the late 1860s he
         returned to the Democratic party.</p>
      <p>Woodbury Blair, the son of Montgomery and Mary Elizabeth
         (Woodbury) Blair, was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on
         September 1, 1852, and died on October 14, 1933. He graduated
         Phillips Exeter Academy, and Harvard University, 1874, and its
         law school, 1876. He practiced law in his father's office in
         Washington, D.C.; was counsel for Citizens' National Bank of
         Washington; trust officer and vice-president of National
         Savings and Trust Company; director in Columbia Title
         Insurance Company, Washington Railway and Electric Company,
         Potomac Electric Company, and Norfolk and Washington Steamboat
         Company; and, president of the Metropolitan Club. He was also
         president of the Central dispensary and emergency hospital of
         Washington, which he developed from a small building to an
         institution of nearly a block, with 280 beds, 300 employees,
         modern nurses' home, new interns' home, x-ray laboratory, and
         out-patient and emergency departments. He was married to the
         former Emily N. Wallach.</p>
      <p>Francis Preston Blair, lawyer and army officer, was born in
         Lexington, Kentucky, on February 10, 1821, and died in St.
         Louis, Missouri, in July 1875. After graduating from Princeton
         University in 1842, he studied law in Washington, was admitted
         to the Kentucky bar in 1843, and began to practice in St.
         Louis. When the Mexican War began he enlisted in the army as a
         private; following the war he returned to his practice in St.
         Louis. He was elected to congress, and in 1857, spoke in favor
         of colonizing the negroes of the United States in Central
         America. Following the South Carolina secession convention, he
         stressed the importance in preventing the seizure by state
         authorities of the St. Louis arsenal, and became the head of
         the military organization then formed, which occasionally
         guarded the arsenal. As brigadier-general in the army, he
         commanded a division in the Vicksburg campaign, led his troops
         in the battles of Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge, and
         was at the head of the 17th corps during Sherman's campaigns
         in 1864-1865. After the war he served in state and government
         positions.</p>
      <p>Charles Levi Woodbury, lawyer, was born in Portsmouth, New
         Hampshire, on May 22, 1820; and, died in 1898. He was a member
         of the Suffolk, Massachusetts bar and U. S. district attorney
         for that state 1858-1861. He edited with George Minot the
         three-volume
