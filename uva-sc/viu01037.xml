      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection, 1,265 items, 1842 (1872-1912) 1943 (one
         Hollinger box), consists of the papers of the family of 
         <persname>John Adams</persname>(ca. 1816/1825-1873), a
         prosperous Richmond free black contractor and plasterer,
         described by one historian as the owner of "the largest number
         of separate pieces of property held by a free [antebellum]
         Negro in the entire state." Some of these items offer glimpses
         of his civic and familial experiences as a free black in a
         slave society. However, the bulk of the collection consists of
         miscellaneous canceled checks, promissory notes and receipts
         (1873-1912) generated by Adams' eldest son 
         <persname>Joseph Adams</persname>(b. 1845) as executor of his
         father's estate. Also present are photocopies (obtained by the
         previous owner of this collection) of 
         <persname>John Adams</persname>'s last will and death
         certificate, and a partial typescript the 1850 federal census
         enumeration of the 
         <famname>Adams family</famname>.</p>
      <p>Evidence of Adams's immediate family and its kinship
         network, extended families, and acquaintances are evident and
         primary sources such as census returns and city directories
         confirm many aspects of the family's existence. It represents
         a long-term contribution to our understanding of the black
         urban experience during slavery, insights on African-American
         life in nineteenth-century 
         <geogname>Richmond, Virginia</geogname>, and, by extension,
         spotlights the activities of antebellum, Civil War, and
         postwar black Southerners.</p>
      <p><persname>John Adams</persname>was born in 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>but it is unknown when he settled
         in 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>. He was a self-employed
         plasterer and building contractor whose family consisted of
         his wife 
         <persname normal="Octavia Adams">Octavia</persname>(b. 1829),
         sons 
         <persname normal="Joseph Adams">Joseph</persname>(b. 1845) and
         <persname normal="John Adams">John</persname>(b. 1847/1849)
         and daughters 
         <persname normal="Alice Adams">Alice</persname>(b. 1848/1849)
         and 
         <persname normal="Deborah Adams">Deborah</persname>(ca.
         1850-1860?). The family residence was 227 West Leigh Street.
         Apparently, Adams was a slaveholder; in 1864 a Confederate
         soldier named Gerard successfully sued him because Adam's
         female slave, a washerwoman, died before returning the
         soldier's laundry to him. Shortly before the slave's death she
         gave her possessions (including Gerard's clothing) to Adams,
         who then sold them.</p>
      <p>Adams died on January 14, 1873 due to erysipelas (strep
         infection); in his January 8 will ("suffering from impaired
         vision . . . said will was read Slowly and distinctly to him")
         he named his eldest son Joseph as executor of his estate and
         bequeathed approximately six houses, eleven property lots and
         cash to his wife Octavia and children (Joseph, John H., and 
         <persname>Alice E. Patterson</persname>), two sisters ( 
         <persname>Josephine Bull</persname>and 
         <persname>Mary Chapman</persname>) and a brother-in-law, 
         <persname>Walter Swann</persname>(?). Adams, who invested
         heavily in real estate, was frequently described as "wealthy";
         according to the 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Richmond Daily Whig</title></bibref>his estate was worth $25,000 to $30,000.</p>
      <p><persname>John Adams</persname>is represented in the
         collection by various financial and legal items chiefly
         pertaining to property transactions in 
         <geogname>Henrico County</geogname>and the cities of 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Petersburg</geogname>: suits, estate papers,
         promissory notes, indentures, contracts, deeds, stocks, tax
         records, insurance policies, orders and payments for building
         supplies. However, he was frequently in financial difficulties
         for failing to pay for property purchases, repay loans, and
         other debts.</p>
      <p>His papers are filed in two folders. The first, " 
         <persname>John Adams</persname>: Miscellaneous Financial &amp;

         <persname normal="Thomas Hill">Thomas</persname>and
