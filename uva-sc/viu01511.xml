      <p><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">THE SOUTHERN ELECTIONS FUND</title><lb/><lb/>The SEF was established in August 1969 as a non-profit
         corporation to assist in electing local and state level
         candidates for office in the eleven states of the old
         Confederacy (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,
         Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,
         and Virginia). It provided technical assistance, moral support
         and grants ranging from $100 to $400 to slates or individual
         candidates, regardless of race, gender, religion, national
         origin or political affiliation. These grants, awarded by a
         bipartisan selection committee, provided financial
         grants-in-aid for election filing fees, campaign and office
         materials based on merit, campaign needs, and community
         support. The Fund began with a gift of $30,000 from an
         anonymous donor after Jack Chatfield, then working with the
         Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in southern
         Georgia (and later the SEF's first director), observed much
         work being done to register black voters "but little or
         nothing available to help black candidates for minor office." 
         <emph render="super">1</emph></p>
      <p>Governed by a board of trustees, the SEF sought private and
         corporate donations with the goal of building a financial base
         of support for Southern politics within the African-American
         community. In 1970 its contributions to the South Carolina
         campaigns of three blacks and two in Alabama led to their
         becoming the first blacks elected to those states'
         legislatures since the end of Reconstruction. Between 1970 and
         1975 the SEF contributed campaign funds and technical advice
         to over 800 candidates, 70 percent of whom were elected to
         office as part of a grass roots process that changed the
         nature and color of Southern politics.

      <p><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="bold" xlink:href="">JULIAN BOND</title><lb/><lb/>Julian Bond, the son of Horace and Julia Bond, was born
         in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1940 and lived in Pennsylvania
         with his family until he enrolled at Morehouse College in
         1957. In 1961 he married Alice Louise Clopton, a student at
         Spelman (they eventually had five children: Phyllis, Horace,
         Michael, Jeffrey, and Julia). In the same year Bond, one
         semester shy of graduation, abandoned his studies to focus on
         the civil rights movement; because of an increasingly active
         civic and political career he did not earn his bachelor's
         degree from Morehouse until 1971. He joined in the growing
         civil rights movement of the 1960s and participated in public
         protest against racial discrimination and became a founder and
         executive secretary of the Committee on Appeal for Human
         Rights at Atlanta University. Bond also founded and served as
         the communications director for the Student Nonviolent
         Coordinating Committee during 1961-1966 and worked on behalf
         of black voter registration in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, and
         Mississippi. He also was managing editor for the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Atlanta Inquirer</title>in 1964.</p>
      <p>Elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1965,
         Bond was denied his seat in January 1966 because of his
         opposition to the Vietnam War; after winning a special
         election in November 1966 and a Supreme Court ruling that the
         House's refusal to seat him was unconstitutional, he was
         seated in 1967 and served until 1974. In 1968, as head of the
         Georgia Democratic Delagation at the National Democratic
         Convention, he was nominated for the Democratic presidential
         ticket but declined because he did not meet age requirements.
         He became a member of the SEF's board of trustees shortly
         after its inception in 1969 and later its chairman,
         1969-1974.</p>
      <p>Bond was elected to the Georgia Senate in 1974 representing
         the Fifth District and served until defeated for re-election
         in the 1986 primary. He became president of the Institute for
         Southern Studies in Durham, North Carolina in 1987; during
         1990 he taught civil rights history at the University of
         Virginia. Divorced from Alice C. Bond in 1989, he married
         Pamela Sue Horowitz, a Washington, D. C., attorney, in
         1990.</p>
      <p>Julian Bond has worked in a variety of capacities for
         numerous organizations: the Delta Ministry Project of the
         National Council of Churches; the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial
         Fund; the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Social Change,
         the Center for Community Sharecropper's Fund (president); the
         Souther Regional Council; the New Democratic Coalition; the
         Voter Education Project; Southern Poverty Law Center
         (president); the NAACP; Southern Correspondents Reporting
         Racial Equality Wars; the Metropolitan Applied Research Center
         of New York (visiting fellow); and the Institute of Applied
         Politics (honorary trustee). His articles and political
         commentary appeared in numerous periodicals, and currently he
         is a moderator for "Black Forum," a nationally syndicated
         television program. He is the author of

         and American University.</p>

          <p>Jack Chatfield was the SEF's first director
               (1968-1969), and his papers (Box 2) comprise one folder
               of correspondence. Of particular interest are a
               postcard, 10 June 1969, and letter, 21 September 1969,
               on how to solicit whites for fund raising, both from
               Virginia F. Durr (b.1903) and a letter, 8 July 1969,
               from Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm (b.1924) accepting
               an offer to become a member of the SEF board. 
               <lb/><lb/></p>
          <p>Robert H. Mitchell was the SEF's treasurer in 1968
               and interim treasurer and fund raising director during
               1969. His papers (Box 2) comprise two folders of
               correspondence. These include a letter, 8 July 1969,
               from Jackie Robinson (1919-1972) regarding his possible
               membership on the board; an 10 October 1969 letter from
               John Conyers, Jr. (b.1929) discussing home rule in the
               District of Columbia; and a letter of 10 October 1969
               from actor Paul L. Newman (b.1925) enclosing a
               contribution. 
               <lb/><lb/></p>
          <p>Antonio Harrison was the first full-time director of
               the SEF (1969-1971); his correspondence comprises two
               folders (Box 2). Present is a form letter, 19 May 1970,
               signed (autopen) by Lilian S. Sandburg [Mrs. Carl
               Sandburg], (1883-1976) on behalf of Meharry Medical
               College and a 15 September 1970 "financial prospectus"
               of American expenditures for the Vietnam War. 
               <lb/><lb/></p>
          <p>Clinton E. Deveaux, executive director from 1971 to
               1972, was formerly on the staff of the Southern
               Christian Leadership Conference and Andrew Young's
               campaign finance manager in 1970. After being hired in
               February 1971, he relocated SEF headquarters from New
               York to Atlanta, Georgia "so it could be closer to the
               people it serves." (A few December 1971 documents
               describe him as the SEF president.) His eleven folders
               (Boxes 3 and 4) contain mostly letter carbons regarding
               fund raising. In the folders "Letters to Clinton
               Deveaux" are letters from Leonard Woodcock, regarding
               the Democratic Policy Council of the Democratic National
               Committee, 14 January 1972; a letter of 25 January 1972
               from Robert S. Strauss (b.1918), soliciting Deveaux's
               membership in a "72 Sponsors Club,"; John Lewis
               (b.1940), concerning the Voter Education Project, 28
               July 1972; Reverend Ralph David Abernathy (1926-1990),
               president, Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
               discussing the SCLC's 15th anniversary convention, 1
               August 1972; and a letter of October 1972 from Senator
               Edward M. Kennedy (b.1932), regarding his Civilian
               Marksmanship Program amendment. 
               <lb/><lb/></p>
          <p>Yancey Martin, executive director from 1973 to 1975,
               was formerly a special assistant and national minorities
               coordinator for Senator George McGovern and the
               Democratic National Committee. His papers (Boxes 4- 5)
               are concerned with fund raising and office management.
               Among these are 1973 reports of Muriel Mitchel Smith,
               director of research. The folders "Letters to Yancey
               Martin" include letters from George L. Brown (b.1926),
               Colorado state senator, 28 March and 13 April 1973;

               Lawrence Douglas Wilder, 16 April 1973 (b.1931; later
               governor of Virginia); California State Senator Mervyn
               M. Dymally (b.1926) [later lieutenant governor and
               congressman], 12 November &amp; 13 December 1973, 17
               January 1974; Gen. Daniel "Chappie" James, Jr.
               (1920-1978) [later commander-in-chief, North American
               Air Defense Command], 26 November 1973; Fred David Gray,
               member, Alabama House of Representatives [1970-1974],

               director, Voter Education Project, 1 February 1974,
               ending his association with the SEF; and, Senator George
               M. McGovern (b.1922), on various subjects, 6 December
               1974.

               <lb/><lb/></p>
          <p>Subseries B (Boxes 5-8) constitutes office files

               author and civil rights historian, to Jack Chatfield, 29

               party. Materials of similar activities are available for
               the motion picture Don't Play Us Cheap, directed by
               noted black filmmaker and actor Melvin Van Peebles
               (b.1932); its world premiere was sponsored by the SEF
               and photographs of Peebles with SEF Executive Director
               Yancey Martin and SEF Vice-Chair and Congressman Andrew
               Young are present.

          <p>Letters of Leonard Woodcock (president of the United
               Auto Workers) are in two folders, "Contributions from
               Unions" and "Fund Raising Responses" (3 January 1974). A
               Margaret Mead (1901-1978) form letter (signed in
               autopen), May 1970, endorsing Planned Parenthood is in
               the "Fund Appeals to SEF" folder. Of interest are
               electrostatic copies of faculty and staff directories
               for Morris Brown College, Clark College, and Atlanta
               University, Atlanta, Georgia, in the folder "Mailing
               Lists." 
               <lb/><lb/></p>
          <p>Subseries E (Boxes 13-15) includes various
               alphabetical folders of materials for SEF campaign and
               election activities. The "Candidates Not Funded by SEF"
               folder contains letters of application for financial
               assistance from Avon Williams Rollins, candidate for the
               Knoxville, Tennessee, board of education, and Henrietta
               M. Canty, candidate for Atlanta's board of aldermen. The
               same is true for the folders "Louisiana" (with
               applications for financial assistance and a letter from
               sheriff's candidate Zelma C. Wyche, Tallaulah,
               Louisiana, enclosing list and handbills of various black
               candidates, 15 October 1975) and "Mississippi" (Ariel
               Williams letters and photocopies of The Institute of
               Politics in Mississippi.) 
               <lb/><lb/></p>
          <p>The "Southern Office Holders Questionnaires" folder
               contains biographical information on black elected and
               appointive officials in the South. Joseph W. Mallisham's
               folder includes guidelines for poll watchers. Political
               campaigns by black Virginians are reflected in folders
               for William Ferguson Reid, Virginia House of Delegates
               (1968-1973), Arthur W. Walls of Arlington County, and
               Roland J. Walton of Norfolk. Also of special interest is
               the folder of racial violence news articles containing
               the chronologies "Some Race Related Deaths in the United
               States (1955-1965)" and "Additional Race Related Deaths
               in the United States Sept., 1965-June, 1966."

          <p>These papers are in Boxes 2 to 15. Subseries A,
               arranged chronologically and alphabetically, contains
               materials pertaining to SEF administrators other than
               Bond. Researchers should note that much of this
               correspondence consists of thank-you letters to donors
               and there are miscellaneous scattered materials and
               references to the SEF leadership throughout the
               collection.

          <p>. It contains ca. 92 slides, 1963-1968, of persons
               and events associated with the civil rights era such as
               Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Nobel Peace Prize, the
               March on Washington, Ku Klux Klan activities, school
               integration, and black Sheriff Tom Gilmore of Greene
               County, Alabama. A videotape of unidentified content is
               present but researchers should note that at present the
               University of Virginia Library does not possess a tape
               player that will enable viewing it. The remainder of
               this series' materials consist of donor index cards,
               computer print-outs, and oversized accounting records.
