      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 300 letters, 1959-1984, and
         their enclosures, from the former University of Virginia
         professor of philosophy, William Stone Weedon (1908-1984) to
         his friend and fellow philosopher, George Leckie (1905- ).
         Both men were graduates of the University of Virginia.</p>
      <p>Weedon began his career at the University as an instructor
         in philosophy, 1934-1938, receiving his doctorate degree from
         the University of Virginia in 1936. He continued teaching in
         Charlottesville throughout his career with a few leaves of
         absence for military duty and research until his retirement in
         1979.</p>
      <p>The letters range widely in content and include such topics
         as Oriental philosophy, poetry, cooking, and art, other
         culinary delights, his non-classified work for the Office of
         Naval Research as a naval officer, family life, and many
         tidbits of University of Virginia social and academic life
         from the faculty perspective.</p>
