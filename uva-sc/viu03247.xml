      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection of 81 items, 1801-1817, consists chiefly of
         correspondence written while James Minor (1785-1828), of
         Sunning Hill, Louisa County, was pursuing his medical
         education, as an assistant to Dr. [James] Carmichael in
         Fredericksburg, 1803-1805, and as a student at the Medical
         School of the University of Pennsylvania, 1805-1807. Besides
         Minor, correspondence include James Alexander, Robert Briggs,
         John Lewis (ca. 1750- ), Robert Miller, his brothers Garritt
         and Peter (1783-1827), John Quarles, George Watson
         (1784-1853), J. Shelton Watson, and W. Wilson, Jr.</p>
      <p>The letters are often concerned with the pursuit of a
         medical education. Correspondents from the University of
         Pennsylvania includes Minor, his nephew Pryor Quarles, and
         George Watson. In a December 14, 1810 letter, Pryor Quarles
         writes to Minor about life as a medical student at the
         latter's alma mater. During 1803-1804, George Watson gives
         advice on learning anatomy, and writes about Dr. Benjamin
         Rush's lectures and beliefs on being a physician (December 11,
         1803); writes about his plans for the winter session,
         mentioning professors Benjamin Rush (1746-1813), William
         Shippen (1736-1808), and Caspar Wistar (1761-1818), and
         discusses Rush's lecture on the means used by physicians to
         get themselves into business (November 9, 1804); and, writes
         concerning "Dr. Rush's opinion, about the prepatory studies of
         young men, who mean to become physicians" (December 13, 1804).
         While a student there, James Minor's letters to his brother,
         Peter, concern George Watson's unfavorable account of the
         University of Edinburgh and discusses the pursuit of truth in
         the study of medicine (January 9, 1806); and includes a
         discussion of Dr. Rush's "Unity of Disease" vs. Dr. [William]
         (1712-1790) Cullen's "Nosology" (January 14, 1807). There are
         also letters from medical students at the University of
         Edinburgh in Scotland. In his letters of October 18, 1806 and
         January 30, 1807, James Alexander expresses his disappointment
         in the school and relates the deficiences in the anatomy
         curriculum. In a letter of April 28, 1806, George Watson also
         expresses his disappointment in the lectures, and writes about
         his studies in chemical and anatomical courses. Another
         interesting letter, April 27, 1805, from James Minor in
         Fredericksburg, concerns his having to devote time to the
         apothecary business and describes a surgical operation and the
         laboratory results performed by Drs. Daniel, Carmichael, and
         Carter. Many of the other correspondents write concerning the
         medical universities, systems of anatomy, and Dr. Rush and
         other professors, apparently in answer to James Minor's
         letters from Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Other letters of interest include: a letter on August 9,
         1806, from Robert Miller in Williamsburg, concerning George
         Watson's correspondence comparing qualifications of
         Philadelphia and Edinburgh professors and the encouragement of
         freedom of thought at the University of Pennsylvania,and
         mentioning the manuscript notes on "Rush's Theory of the
         functions of the Spleen, Liver, &amp; Pancreas," which are
         also included; and, a letter on October 21, 1810, from John
         Lewis in Nashville, Tennessee during his move to Kentucky,
         describing the land west of the Allegheny in great detail.</p>
