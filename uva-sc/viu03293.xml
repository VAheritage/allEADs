      <p><emph render="bold">Theodorick Bland</emph><lb/>Born in Prince George County, Virginia, on March 21,
         1742, Theodorick Bland was the son of Theodorick Bland of
         Cawsons on the Appamatox River and Frances (Bolling) Bland.
         Bland was educated in England, studying first at a school in
         Wakefield, Yorkshire, from 1753 until 1759. He attended an
         infirmary in Liverpool as a student of medicine from 1759 to
         1761, and then entered the University of Edinborough, from
         which he recieved an M.D. degree in 1763. Returning to
         Virginia in 1764, he began practicing medicine in Prince
         George County. Bland's health suffered as a result of his
         practice, and in 1771 he retired and became a planter; he
         married Martha Dangerfield.</p>
      <p>Bland strongly supported the American cause during the
         Revolutionary War. On June 24, 1775, he participated in a raid
         on the governor's palace in Williamsburg, in which a group of
         twenty-four patriots removed from arms from the palace to the
         powder magazine. At the end of that year, he wrote harsh
         letters in the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Gazette</title>against the
         royal governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, under the signature
         of "Cassius". Bland was appointed captain of the 1st Troop of
         Virginia Cavalry on June 13, 1776, and colonel of the 1st
         Continental Dragoons on March 31, 1777. He commanded mounted
         troops in the New Jersey and Philadelphia Campaigns and fought
         in the battle of Brandywine.</p>
      <p>On November 5, 1778, Washington ordered Bland to take
         command of an escort to conduct the Convention Army troops
         from Massachusetts and Connecticut to Albermarle County,
         Virginia. He was then placed in command of the post in
         Charlottesville, the Albermarle Barracks, where the prisoners
         were housed, and remained there until November 1779. In 1780,
         the Virginia General Assembly elected him a delegate to the
         Continental Congress. At the end of his term, he returned to
         his plantation, Farmingdale, which had been plundered by the
         enemy.</p>
      <p>Bland served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1786
         to 1788, and was an unsuccessful candidate for governor
         against Edmund Randolph in 1786. He was a member of the
         Virginia convention of 1788 for the consideration of the
         proposed Federal Constitution, and voted against its adoption.
         Elected a member of the first House of Representatives, he
         died while attending the session in New York on June 1,
         1790.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Edmund Ruffin</emph><lb/>Edmund Ruffin was born on January 5, 1794, in Prince
         George County, Virginia. His parents were George and Jane
         (Lucas) Ruffin. He was educated at home until the age sixteen
         when he entered the College of William and Mary. Ruffin soon
         was suspended, however, for neglecting his studies. He served
         as a private in the War of 1812, but saw no active duty. On
         returning home, he married Susan Travis of Williamsburg and
         took charge of his father's Coggin's Point Farm.</p>
      <p>Ruffin grew increasingly concerned about the unproductive
         land of the Tidewater region, and the seemming indefferencte
         of most other planters. The soil had worn out from continual
         planting of the same crop and many persons were moving
         westward. Ruffin attempted to solve the problem on his own
         farm by sturdy and experimentation. After reading Sir Humphrey
         Dave's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Elements of Agricultural
         Chemistry,</title>he speculated that vegetable acids made the
         soil sterile and unable to return manure. He decided that the
         use of marl (a mixture of clay and carbonate of lime),
         fertilizers, crop rotation, drainage, and proper plowing would
         revitalize the soil. Ruffin's experiments proved extremely
         successful, and in 1818 he presented his findings to the
         Prince George Agricultural Society and then printed them in
         expanded form in the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">American Farmer.</title>In 1832, he
         published a book about his theories, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">An Essay on Calcareous
         Manures,</title>and in the following year launched an
         agricultural journal, the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Farmer's Register.</title>The journal
         was extremely influential in spreading Ruffin's methods of
         scientific farming throughout the South. Ruffin served on the
         first Virginia State Board of Agriculture, and in 1842 became
         agricultural surveyor of South Carolina. He was elected the
         first president of the Virginia State Agricultural Society in
         1845, but declined because he felt that his work was not
         sufficiently appreciated in his home state. He reconsidered,
         however, and took the post in 1852. He actively encouraged
         experimental farming and agricultural education, and continued
         to write and speak extensively about agriculture.</p>
      <p>Ruffin was always interested in politics, but his tenure in
         the Virginia Senate (1823-1826) left him disgusted with
         politicians. He was first a Whig, but became a Democrat when
         the slavery and states' rights clash developed. An ardent
         defender of slavery and one of the first secessionists in
         Virginia, Ruffin discussed his ideas in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">De Bow's Review</title>and the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Southern Literary Messenger.</title>He
         also published serveral pro-slavery pamphlets. He was an
         advocate of direct trade with Europe, attended three Southern
         commercial conventions, and started the League of United
         Southerners. Hoping that John Brown's raid would galvanize the
         South, he secured Brown's pikes and gave one to the governor
         of each Southern state. Ruffin was invited to sit in three
         seceding conventions, and while serving as a volunteer with
         the Palmetto Guard of Charleston, was allowed to fire the
         first shot from Morris Island against Fort Sumter. He joined
         with the Palmetto Guards again as a "temporary" private at the
         First Battle of Manassas.</p>
      <p>During the Civil War, Ruffin travelled throughout the
         South, visiting many military camps, despite his failing
         health. He became increasingly pessimistic about the outcome
         of the war after the Battle of Gettysburg. Northern soldiers
         occupied his plantation, Malbourne in Hanover County, and
         ransacked his library. Totally devastated by the collapse of
         the Confederacy, Ruffin committed suicide on June 18, 1865,
         and was buried in the family cemetery at Marlbourne. He was
         survived by three of his eleven children.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Bland-Ruffin Collection, 1741-1788;1859-1865 (100
         items) consists of letters and papers of Revolutionary soldier
         Theodorick Bland and secessionist Edmund Ruffin, and relates
         primarily to their wartime experiences. Students of both the
         American Revolution and the Civil War would find this
         collection very valuable, since it contains letters written by
         leaders of both periods and some first-person narratives of
         military events. The majority of the letters were written to,
         rather than by, Bland and Ruffin, and over two-thirds pertain
         to the Civil War.</p>
      <p>Bland himself wrote to the loyalist Reverend Jacob
         Duché, attacking his views and character, to St.
         George Tucker (in cipher), to Lieutenant Colonel Muir, and to
         his wife Martha "Patsy" (Dangerfield) Bland. In a circular
         letter, Governor Thomas Jefferson requested that Bland provide
         information about the arms furnished by his regiment to the
         Continental army, and Colonel Armand (Marquis de la Roulerie
         Tuffin) expressed his displeasure at the failure of the
         Continental Congress to promote him. Hessian officers Major
         General von Riesedel and General Specht wrote to Bland
         concerning affairs of the Convention Army at the Albermarle
         Barracks. Other correspondents of note are Richard Bland,
         Edmund Randolph, and John Page, the last offering an
         interesting account of Benedict Arnold's invasion of Virginia
         in 1781. In addition to the letters, the Bland material
         includes a number of papers relating to Prince George County.
         There is a fragment of a loyalist petition circulated in the
         summer of 1781 by Archibald Robertson, some political
         lampoons, a few military documents, and one unidentified
         drawing.</p>
      <p>The letters to Edmund Randolph form a more cohesive unit
         than the Bland papers, and document Ruffin's unflagging
         support of the Confederacy. P.G.T. Beauregard, S.W. Ferguson,
         and other military leaders provided Ruffin with passes to
         various military encampments, and individuals sought his help
         in obtaining appointments or transfers. In a letter to C.G.
         Memminger, the Confederate secretary of the treasury, on
         January 22, 1864, enclosing a check for four hundred dollars,
         Ruffin stated that he would contribute as much of his income
         as possible to the cause. Letters of thanks from Charles
         Marbeth, mayor of Charleston, and R.R. Harrison of
         Fredericksburg indicate that Ruffin was true to his word. Most
         of the largely personal letter from such individuals as
         Rebecca Hewitt to Ruffin comment on the course of the war and
         its impact on daily life. Of special interest is a letter from
         Captain John Scott to Ruffin, enclosing a copy of the detailed
         report he submitted to General Holmes on the First Battle of
         Manassas. Completing the collection is a fragment of a note
         apparently written by Ruffin shortly before his death, in
         which he states that he wishes to be buried in South Carolina,
         and hopes that the next generation will uphold his
         reputation.</p>

      <p>Charles Campbell found the Bland papers at Cawson's, but
         unable to carefully examine, wrote to Edmund Ruffin about
         them. Campbell subsequently published an edition of

         the letters in our collection appear in this volume (available
         in the McGregor Library A 1840 .B53). In a note, Ruffin states
         that he appended to the original Bland papers some additional
         items of related interest, "derived from different
         sources."</p>
