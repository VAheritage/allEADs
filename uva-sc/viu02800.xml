               <p>A letter from Samson Ceasar, Monrovia, Liberia to
               David S. Haseldon of Buchannon, Lewis County, [West]
               Virginia. Ceasar notes that all landed safely in
               Monrovia. Most have had fever, and four have died,
               including the wife of the missionary Reverend Mr. Wrigt.
               Ceasar says that people have done better than he
               expected, and that many have become rich. He says that
               the "natives," most of whom are "Croomen" [Kru], "do
               most of the work for the people in this place." Samson
               mentions an offer from a Presbyterian family to support
               and educate him. The Methodist bishop has also offered
               to find him a station. Samson is not certain in what
               part of Africa he will be placed.</p>

               <p>Samson Ceasar writes to Henry Westfall asking him to
               forward a newspaper to Adam Carper. The newspaper
               contains news of Africa, and Samson asks that Westfall
               tell Adam to read the news and to have his neighbors
               read it as well. Ceasar apologizes that he cannot write
               more, but that he is traveling to Caldwell. The
               newspaper has apparently been endorsed by one of the
               storekeepers in the area.</p>

               <p>Samson Ceasar writes about conditions in Monrovia,
               Liberia among the recent immigrants. He notes that many
               people have died there, and he therefore has not
               traveled extensively. He comments on the weekly arrival
               of ships from Europe. He talks about the "natural
               talents" of the natives, and discusses recent death and
               sickness among the white missionaries. He realizes that
               "it is as nigh to heaven in Africa as it is in America,"
               and looks forward to seeing Westfall and his family "on
               the right hand of God...where we can enjoy the company
               of each other for ever." He asks Westfall to write "as
               often as [he] can" about the health of his family and
               friends, and sends his greetings to all of them. He
               expects to return "in two or three years," and concludes
               by apologizing for his bad writing.</p>

               <p>Samson Ceasar writes that since his arrival in Africa
               six months ago he has "not kept [his] bed one day," even
               though he has had a slight fever and some chills. He
               says that the more he sees of Africa, the more he likes
               it, though he is critical of the American practice of
               sending the "dumb" slaves to Africa instead of the ones
               who will help to improve the country. He describes the
               favorable growing conditions in Africa and notes that
               the white and black races would be equal if only given
               the same opportunities. He says that he has been
               studying grammar and arithmetic and describes his
               continuing dedication to his religious life.</p>

               <p>Samson Ceasar complains of having received only two
               letters from his friend though he has written "as many
               as a dozen" to him. He recounts that a number of people
               have died from sickness in the last three months. He
               remarks that a number of preachers have decided to
               remain with their families in Liberia "for life"
               including the superintendent of the Methodist Episcopal
               Church. He mentions the possibility of coming to
               America.</p>

               <p>Samson Ceasar writes that a settlement at Bassa Cove
               (about one hundred miles from Monrovia) has been
               attacked by natives. According to Ceasar, 15 to 20
               Americans were killed. He says that he will send one
               newspaper with this letter and promises to send another
               paper in the next couple of days. Ceasar says that he
               does not fear the natives.</p>
