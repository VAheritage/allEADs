        <p>The papers of the 
             Baylor family of "Newmarket," 
             Bowling Green,              Caroline County, Virginia, contain ca.
            2000 items (11 Hollinger boxes, 4.5 linear feet),
            1653-1915, and consist of correspondence, legal and
            financial papers, ledgers, genealogical material, students
            notebooks and bound volumes, scrapbooks, photographs, a
            diary, literary compositions, military papers pertaining to
            the Revolutionary War, newsclippings, the records of 
             James Bowen Baylor and the 
             United States Coast and Geodetic
            Survey, and miscellaneous papers.</p>
        <p>These papers pertain to 
             John Baylor (1650-1720) of 
             Gloucester County, and 
             King and Queen County, Virginia, and
            his wife, 
             Lucy Todd O'Brien of 
             New Kent County, Virginia, and four
            generations of their descendants. The 
             John Baylor ledgers, 1719-1755, reveal
            that 
             John Baylor was a wealthy merchant,
            planter, and shipowner. He also served as a burgess,
            representing 
             Gloucester County in the 1693 
             General Assembly and 
             King and Queen County in 1718.</p>
        <p>
                John Baylor's son, 
             John Baylor (1705-1772), greatly
            increased the family landholdings when he received a royal
            land grant in 1726 in what was to become 
             Caroline County, Virginia. 
             John Baylor was educated in 
             England, at the 
             Putney Grammer School and 
             Caius College, 
             Cambridge. While in 
             England, he developed a keen interest
            in thoroughbred horses and horse racing, going so far as to
            name his new home, " 
             Newmarket, " for the famous English
            racing center. He became an important colonial horse
            importer and breeder whose stables greatly contributed to
            the development of American thoroughbreds. 
             John Baylor also rendered public
            service to the newly formed county of 
             Caroline, as a colonel in the county
            militia and a burgess in 1742-1749, and 1756-1765.</p>
        <p>All four of the sons of 
             John Baylor (1705-1772) contributed in
            some way to the American effort during the Revolutionary
            War. 
             John Baylor (1750-1808), the heir of " 
             Newmarket, " while unable to fight due
            to a childhood injury, gave financial support to the war
            effort. He later had difficulties in shedding his
            reputation as a "Tory" because he had gone back to 
             England in 1778 to marry his cousin, 
             Frances Norton (1760-1815) and had to
            live in 
             Europe until they could obtain a return
            passage to 
             America.</p>
        <p>
                George Baylor (1752-1784) was a member
            of the 
             Caroline County Committee of Safety,
            1775-1776, and from 1775-1777, he was aide-de-camp of
            General 
             George Washington. He was commanding
            officer of the 
             3rd Regiment Light Dragoons when he was
            wounded and captured on September 28, 1778. He was
            eventually exchanged and his regiment was consolidated with
            the 
             First Continental Dragoons on November
            9, 1782, which he commanded until the end of the war. On
            September 30, 1783, he received his commission as a Brevet
            Brigadier General.</p>
        <p>
                Walker Baylor served as a lieutenant
            and captain of the 
             3rd Regiment Light Dragoons during the
            Revolution. He along with his other brother 
             Robert Baylor, who also served in the
            Revolution, immigrated to 
             Kentucky. Later 
             Robert Baylor apparently settled in the
             Pearl River area of the 
             Mississippi Territory.</p>
        <p>The estate of 
             John Baylor (1750-1808) was hopelessly
            entangled when he inherited it from his father in 1772 and
            much of it was lost through his own ineptitude as a
            businessman and the dishonesty of others. However, the
            house and two thousand acres were entailed and could not be
            alienated; these were passed on to his son, 
             John Baylor ( ? ), who married 
             Maria Ann Roy and produced Dr. 
             John Roy Baylor (1821-1897). It was Dr.
             John Roy Baylor's son, Captain 
             James Bowen Baylor (1848-1924), who was
            a member of the 
             United States Coast and Geodetic
            Survey team.</p>
        <p>The correspondence series contains the correspondence
            from family members, friends, and business associates of
            all the above generations of the 
             Baylor family, beginning with Colonel 
             John Baylor (1705-1772). Letters
            pertaining to the sojourn of 
             John Baylor (1750-1808) in 
             England prior to and during the
            Revolutionary War include the following: a reference to
            Colonel 
             John Baylor's son at school in 
             Caius College, 
             Cambridge (August 12,1769); his
            intentions of returning to the 
             United States (December 28, 1770); the
            advice of 
             William Bond, a former teacher of 
             John Baylor, for him to seek further
            educational opportunities upon the continent rather than to
            return to college studies (July 15, 1773); 
             William Bond's request for 
             John Baylor to ignore "national evils"
            and to visit 
             England (May 4, 1778); 
             John Baylor's trip to 
             England to wed his cousin, 
             Frances Norton (1778); a reference to
            the Baylor's leaving 
             England, and comments concerning the
            fashions and decadence of 
             England (May 4, 1779).</p>
        <p>Correspondence concerning events leading up to and
            including the Revolutionary War includes:

             Madigaschar woman," "man of 
             Callabar, " and " 
             Barbadoes negro." The accounts of the
