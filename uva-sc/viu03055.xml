        <head>Access Restrictions</head>
        <p>There are no restrictions on access to the Library's
            microfilms of the William Faulkner manuscripts in its
            custody; the microfilm may be consulted by any interested
            party, and it will be lent through the interlibrary loan
            system. Materials are constantly added. Long-term loans may
            be arranged. Use of the microfilm will be restricted to the
            premises of the borrowing library. No loans will be made to
            individuals. Researchers should enquire of the Manuscripts
            Division concerning availability of microfilm of
            manuscripts that are pertinent to their work. Most of the
            literary manuscripts in our collections written by
            Faulkner, both holograph and typescript, have also been
            published in facsimile in William Faulkner Manuscripts, 25
            vols (New York: Garland, 1986-87).</p>
        <p>By the terms of the agreement by which the William
            Faulkner Foundation transferred the original manuscripts to
            the University, access to the original manuscripts is
            restricted (to ensure the survival of the
            physically-delicate originals) to doctoral candidates at
            the dissertation stage of their programs, and to certain
            mature scholars and critics. But even these researchers
            must demonstrate need to see the originals that goes beyond
            the requirements of most routine research. A doctoral
            candidate at the dissertation stage, or other qualified
            researcher who believes that his or her work requires
            access to the originals must correspond with the Curator of
            Manuscripts prior to arrival at the Library may be copied
            subject to the normal rules of the Library established
            under the conditions of the Copyright Act. All copying is
            performed by the Printing Services Department of the
            University.to obtain permission for access.</p>
        <p>No microfilm, electrostatic, or other types of copies
            may be made of materials written by William Faulkner that
            are in our William Faulkner Collections. Other materials in
            the collections may be copied subject to the normal rules
            of the Library established under the conditions of the
            Copyright Act. All copying is performed by the Printing
            Services Department of the University.</p>
