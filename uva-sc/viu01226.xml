      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>In 1987 the U. S. General Services Administration (GSA)
         began planning to provide greater office space for Federal
         agencies and to provide additional courtrooms and support
         space for the adjacent U.S. courthouse in the Civic
         Center-Foley Square area of lower Manhattan. The burial ground
         ("Negros Burial Ground") and human remains were accidently
         unearthed in June 1991 on the proposed site for a new federal
         office building at 290 Broadway (between Broadway, Duane, Elk,
         and Reade Streets) leading to public and scholarly calls for a
         construction halt and full-scale archaeological excavation and
         testing. New York City Mayor David Dinkins established the
         Mayor's Task Force on the African Burial Ground in 1992, and
         members of this task force later formed the basis of the
         federal steering committee. Scholars believed the bodies found
         were of African and African-American slaves with earliest
         burials dating to the early eighteenth century.</p>
      <p>By July 1992, workers had removed ca. 390 human remains to
         the Foley Square Archaeological Laboratory but the GSA
         announced its intention to excavate an additional 200 burials
         on a section of the site that was to become a four-story
         pavilion beside the office building. In response to opposition
         by Mayor Dinkins, the African-American community, and
         Congressman Augustus Savage (chairperson of the House of
         Representatives' Subcommittee on Buildings and Grounds)
         meetings were held that culminated in an agreement among the
         parties involved that a federal advisory committee of
         African-American community leaders and professionals be
         established to make recommendations to the GSA concerning the
         site.</p>
      <p>The Federal Steering Committee for the African Burial
         Ground, New York City, New York, was chartered by the federal
         government in October 1992, and Congress passed Public Law
         102-393 (signed by President George Bush) ordering the GSA to
         abandon construction on the pavilion site and approving a $3
         million appropriation for the memorialization of the African
         Burial Ground site. The Committee included anthropologists,
         architects, attorneys, city, state and federal officials,
         clergy, concerned community members, historians, and museum
         professionals. It met at least ten times between July 1993 and
         August 1994 at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black
         Culture, New York Public Library, and was chaired by Dr.
         Howard Dodson, director of the Schomburg. Its mandate was to
         represent community interests and make recommendations
         regarding the Burial Ground, review proposals regarding the
         human remains on the Pavilion site, oversee preliminary
         analysis, curation and reinternment of remains removed from
         the African Burial Ground, and make formal proposals to the
         GSA and Congress regarding care of the remains and
         construction of a memorial on or near the site.</p>
      <p>The Office of Public Education and Interpretation (OPEI),
         under the direction of Dr. Sherrill D. Wilson, an urban
         anthropologist, was established in May 1993 as the official
         information source to educate the public about the history of
         African Burial Ground and disseminate knowledge gained through
         research of the site, its human remains, and contemporary and
         historical activities associated with the site. OPEI also
         published Update: Newsletter of the African Burial Ground
         &amp; Five Points Archaeological Project to provide current
         information about the site and its historical context and
         insights on African life in seventeenth and eighteenth century
         New York and information on other recently discovered black or
         slave cemeteries.</p>
      <p>Approximately 427 remains were transferred
         (September-November 1993) to Howard University's Biological
         Anthropology Laboratory for cleaning, anthropometric and
         statistical analysis and designated the New York African
         Burial Ground Project with Dr. Michael L. Blakey as the
         scientific project director. The more than a million
         non-burial artifacts recovered at the site were retained at
         the Foley Square Archaeological Laboratory in New York City.
         [For preliminary reports and updates concerning these sites,
         see two Update articles by Dr. Warren R. Perry: "Analysis of
         the African Burial Ground Archaeological Materials,"
         (February/March 1997): 3-5, 14 and "Archaeological Update From
         The Foley Square Laboratory," (Spring 1998): 3-5.]</p>
      <p>The Committee submitted its recommendations report to
         Congress on August 6, 1993 and officially ended its existence
         on September 30, 1994 but ongoing research of the African
         Burial Ground Project, its site and the human remains, and
         designs for a memorial and interpretive center, continued with
         U. S. General Services Administration funding. Presently,
         there are plans to return the remains to a new memorial and
         interpretative center. The site, consisting of five acres in
         lower Manhattan, was designated a New York City Historic
         District (February 1993) and a National Historic Landmark
         (April 1993). A PBS science documentary, "Slavery's Buried
         Past: The New York African Burial Ground," was broadcast in
         December 1996.</p>

      <p>The Office of Public Education and Interpretation of the
         African Burial Ground (OPEI) folder (Box 3) contains newspaper
         clippings and miscellaneous official printed items including
         The African Burial Ground Project (a brochure) and an African
         Burial Ground Chronology (March 15, 1989 to November 17,
         1997). Another OPEI publication, African Burial Ground
         Project: Classroom Study Guide and Glossary (Box 1), is a
         study guide for a broad overview of the African presence and
         the African Burial Ground in colonial New York.</p>
      <p>Another item of special interest is a blue three-ring
         notebook, Slides and Photographs, containing slides,
         photographs and photocopies prepared and used by Handler for
         his public lectures; the following numbered (usually circled

         Vernon, New York, several pages of photocopies color-coded or
         marked by their representative slides or negative numbers, and
         two sheets of twelve negatives (chiefly extra negatives of
         slides retained by Dr. Handler) are also present in the
         notebook.</p>
      <p>Correspondence in the folder Southern Illinois University
         at Carbondale includes an October 2, 1992 letter to Handler
         concerning the university's press release announcing his
         appointment to the African Burial Ground advisory committee;
         William J. Diamond, Regional Administrator, New York, to Dr.
         Benjamin Shepherd, Vice-President for Academic Affairs,
         Southern Illinois University, November 16, 1992, concerning
         Handler's appointment to the "General Services Administration
         Federal Advisory Committee: The Steering Committee for the
         African Burial Ground, New York," Handler's curriculum vitae,
         and miscellaneous notes.</p>
      <p>Three folders, Steering Committee Agendas, 1992-1994,
         includes the October 5, 1992 minutes of the Mayor's Committee
         On The African Burial Ground, agendas and minutes of the
         federal Steering Committee meetings, letters, memoranda,

         22, 1993 meeting sign-in sheet (photocopy), and minutes of the
         final meeting of August 22, 1994. The official charter
         (September 23, 1992) identifying it as a General Services
         Administration committee designated "The Steering Committee
         for The African Burial Ground, New York, New York" and
         establishing its termination date "on or before September 1,
         1994" is in the folder Steering Committee Charter and General
         Services Administration Guidelines. Ten folders, Steering
         Committee on The African Burial Ground of The City of New York
         (Minutes), 1993- 1994, contain bound typescript minutes; only
         half of the March 28, 1994 minutes were transcribed because
