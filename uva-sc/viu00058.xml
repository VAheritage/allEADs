                  <p>[In this letter, he sends Harriet some wild
                  pansies growing by the wayside because they made him
                  think of her, "I feel sure that the thought of you
                  was put into my head by some divine intervention in
                  the affairs of mortals, and for some purpose. My
                  interpretation -with my feeble light and dull
                  intuition-is that I am to send you some of those poor
                  little frail pansies." He then goes on to explain
                  that pansies are for thoughts and their old English
                  name "hearts-ease" is better suited than "pansies =
                  pensees"]</p>

                  <p>[Responding to her impression of his goodness
                  Bierce writes, "It is pretty easy to be good to you,
                  and I don't expect any credit for it in the books of
                  the Recording Angel. He will say: `Bah ! who wouldn't
                  be good to 
                  <persname>Hattie Hershberg</persname>?' and then he
                  will debit me with one selfish motive." He also
                  mentions 
                  <corpname>Kodak</corpname>photographs of a group
                  consisting of Hattie, Mamie, Dave, Selma, Louise, and
                  himself, while assuring her of his devotion, "you are
                  still the only girl in the world; and if there is a
                  man who does not love you he is a scoundrel."
                  Referring to his experience in military life Bierce
                  writes, "No, my pet scheme for making soldiers of the
                  Major's little rascals is not practicable. The
                  confounded Government is so particular about the
                  moral character of its recruits that I couldn't
                  enlist myself. This is a great disappointment to me.
                  I had quite set my heart on getting Co. A into 
                  <geogname>Cuba</geogname>, to prove that bad boys
                  make the best soldiers. But I'm assured that it
                  cannot be done."]</p>
