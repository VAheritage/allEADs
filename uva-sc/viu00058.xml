          <p>In this letter, he sends Harriet some wild
 pansies growing by the wayside because they made him
 think of her, "I feel sure that the thought of you
 was put into my head by some divine intervention in
 the affairs of mortals, and for some purpose. My
 interpretation -with my feeble light and dull
 intuition-is that I am to send you some of those poor
 little frail pansies." He then goes on to explain
 that pansies are for thoughts and their old English
 name "hearts-ease" is better suited than "pansies =
 pensees"</p>

          <p>Responding to her impression of his goodness
 Bierce writes, "It is pretty easy to be good to you,
 and I don't expect any credit for it in the books of
 the Recording Angel. He will say: 'Bah ! who wouldn't
 be good to Hattie Hershberg?' and then he
 will debit me with one selfish motive." He also
 mentions Kodak photographs of a group consisting of Hattie, Mamie, Dave, Selma, Louise, and
 himself, while assuring her of his devotion, "you are still the only girl in the world; and if there is a
 man who does not love you he is a scoundrel." Referring the Preston School of Industry in Ione, California, a juvenile correction institute supervised by a relative of Hirshberg's Bierce writes, "No, my pet scheme for making soldiers of the Major's little rascals is not practicable. The confounded Government is so particular about the moral character of its recruits that I couldn't enlist myself. This is a great disappointment to me. I had quite set my heart on getting Co. A into Cuba, to prove that bad boys make the best soldiers. But I'm assured that it cannot be done."</p>
