      <p>Elizabeth Dabney Langhorne Lewis was a member of a
         prominent Virginia family, as well as an aunt of Lady Nancy
         Astor, and was an activist for women's rights.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>There are two letters, February 1931, written to Elizabeth
         Dabney Langhorne (Mrs. John H.) Lewis (1851-1946) of
         Lynchburg, Virginia, concerning women's issues, along with a
         copy of Mrs. Lewis' obituary, January 1946. A letter, February
         19, 1931, from Rosewell Page, Chairman, Finance Committee, of
         the Cooperative Education Association of Virginia, requests a
         list of persons who might be interested in becoming
         contributing members of the Association. The letter comments
         on the purpose of the Association as "helping people to help
         themselves in providing the best school, health, home, civic
         and social conditions for their respective communities." On
         February 24, 1931, Mrs. Randolph Maynard, Chairman of the
         State Central Committee, Liberal Arts College for Women at
         Charlottesville, an affiliate of the University of Virginia,
         writes requesting her support in regards to a statement for
         Edwin Anderson Alderman, President of the University of
         Virginia. A rough copy of the statement, February 26, to
         Alderman is included; it regards the need for "a dignified and
         suitable building" to be designated "to house the activities
         and furnish suitable social quarters for the graduate and
         professional women students." The statement also advises
         Alderman of its support by the women alumnae of the
         University, the presidents of various state-wide women's
         organizations, and individual women prominent in the social,
         professional, educational and civic life of Virginia. At this
         time, the University of Virginia was the only institution in
         Virginia offering post graduate work to women for degrees, and
         there was a need to promote scholarship and create an
         atmosphere conducive to persuing an education. The obituary
         contains information on the family, social, and professional
         aspects of Mrs. Lewis' life.</p>
