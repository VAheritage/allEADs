         <p>This collection consists of letters, Bible records (with
         two probable slave births), genealogical notes, photographs,
         and miscellaneous documents, 1849-1935, 112 items (1 Hollinger
         box) pertaining chiefly to the Warren family. It includes
         discussion of the daily lives of several women in the Warren
         family, particularly Mary Eliza Warren Brown, who served as a
         governess to several families in Nelson County, and
         Petersburg, Virginia. Typed notes accompanying the letters
         also convey family information.</p>
         <p>Letters mention domestic duties, church duties, illnesses,
         social events, and the 1886 earthquake (see 1886 Aug 25). Also

         missionaries and their work, especially an account of life in
         Japan at the turn of the nineteenth century, possibly by the
         Rev. James Chapman, and letters from Iso Sano (1898 Jan 17,
         Mar 28; 1904 Oct 14). Photographs include those of Mary Eliza
         Warren Brown, Edward Warren, Edward J. Warren, Laura Warren,
