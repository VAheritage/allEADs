         <p>This collection contains letters from Liberian settlers who were
            former slaves of Dr. James Hunter Terrell, <date>1783-1856</date> of
            "Music Hall," Albemarle County, Virginia, chiefly to his nephew, Dr.
            James Hunter Minor, <date>1818-1862?</date>.</p>
         <p>In his will Terrell directed that all of his slaves were to be freed
            after his death provided they would emigrate to Liberia. He also
            directed that one of his plantations, "Ducking Hole Place" in Louisa
            County, be sold to benefit the emancipated slaves. Terrell's
            nephew-who was his adopted son and also his executor-James H. Minor,
            carried out his uncle's instructions. The former slaves were
            transported to Liberia on the <title render="italic">Mary Caroline
               Stevens</title>, a ship specifically built to transport freed
            slaves and supplies to Africa.</p>
         <p>Upon arriving in Liberia the emigrants settled chiefly in Careysburg
            but also in Clay Ashland, and in Monrovia. They soon began to
            correspond with Dr. Minor. A few of the letters are addressed to
            other individuals including Howell Lewis 1832-?, an Albemarle County
            teacher and farmer, and the Rev. W. Slaughter.</p>
         <p>In their letters, the settlers request supplies, inquire after the
            health of family and friends, and describe life in Liberia. There is
            a very brief mention of conflicts with local African tribes. Several
            of the letters contain references to Saunders A. Campion, governor
            of Careysburg and an agent of the American Colonization Society; Dr.
            James H. Hall (?-1889), founder, and first agent of the State of
            Maryland in Liberia; and of Rev. John Seys <date>1799-1872</date>,
            special agent and resident minister to Liberia.</p>

                  <p>Mary Michie tells of her family's safe arrival in Monrovia.
                     She states that Monrovia is nearly as large as
                     Charlottesville, the people are genteel and enlightened,
                     and summer in Liberia is not as warm as summer in America.
                     She plans to stay in Monrovia and would appreciate any
                     means of assistance. She says that she has met a man named
                     John Henry Paxton who came to Liberia from the Carr family
                     and asks Minor to direct his letters to him as Postmaster
                     General. She sends love from her and her family with
                     special thanks to Minor's uncle [Dr. James Hunter
                     Terrell].</p>

                  <p>Letter from William Douglass Dr. Minor in which he records
                     his first impressions of his new home in Liberia. He covers
                     the health of his company during their crossing, the names
                     of other former slaves who, like him, have immigrated to
                     Careysburg, the general schedule of religious activities
                     they follow through the week, and an assessment of the
                     general beauty and productiveness of the land, especially
                     the potential for cotton production. The letter is full of
                     praise for the Colonization agents and optimistic about the
                     future.</p>

                  <p>This letter, apparently of collective authorship by William
                     Douglass, Hugh Walker, and Samuel Carr, speaks wholly for
                     items needed to live: clothes, tools, and food. The three
                     "authors" of the letter seem to be the voice of a larger
                     part of the community since requests for such goods are
                     made for a variety of individuals. The tone of the letter
                     conveys some impatience with Dr. Minor for his lack of
                     organization and promptness in sending such items.</p>

                  <p>Young Barrett, Maria Barrett, and Isabella Johnson write to
                     Minor sending news of the health of a variety of colonists
                     including Charles and Richard Barrett, William Douglass and
                     his family, Charles and Philip Twine, George, Winslow and
                     Hugh Walker, Washington, Allen, Wilson, and Martin Coleman,
                     John and Washington Michie, and Thomas and David Scott.
                     They are all at the Interior Settlement. They also list the
                     deaths at the other locations. They request a variety of
                     supplies, some for barter, including flour, calico, fish, 2
                     pairs of black garters, leather shoes, bleached and
                     unbleached cotton, bedspreads, dress patterns, satin
                     ribbon. They also request about 20 dollars in gold or
                     silver. Some supplies included in a previous shipment were
                     not received, evidently stolen. They request that these be
                     sent by the Mary Caroline Stevens, a ship evidently set to
                     arrive in the Spring. Postscripts request powder, shot,
                     sugar, more flour and more calico. References to some
                     individuals are unclear.</p>

                  <p>Hugh Walker informs Dr. Minor that despite twelve deaths
                     including those of Robinson Scott and his son, James;
                     Patrick Michie, Buck Thompson, Richard Franklin, Jacob
                     Twine and his grand child, and despite the illness of his
                     own wife, he is doing quite well and is "much pleased with
                     this place." However, Walker's optimism is mixed with a
                     strange apocalyptic vision concerning the imminent death of
                     those around him and his community. Such a vision is
                     exemplified by statements such as the following: "While
                     some are rejoicing at their friends going to a better house
                     others are filled with grief at the thoughts of their
                     future estate." The close of the letter, while conventional
                     in its wish of wellness upon Dr. Minor, ends in a touch of
                     sadness and loss at the separation of Walker from his
                     parents and friends who are still in America.</p>

                  <p>Penned by the Superintendent of the Careysburg American
                     Colonization Society, Saunders A. Campion, this letter
                     describes the newcomers' joy at having travelled from
                     America and into the Interior Settlement with only minor
                     discomforts of sea-sickness. The "Liberia Project" is
                     explicitly refered to as an "experiment" and the letter's
                     signers blatantly state that they have, "as yet to regret"
                     being induced by Doctor Hall to partake in this experiment.
                     The rest of the letter is a grocery list of items each
                     family needs. A request is made that the items be boxed
                     safely and shipped on the spring return of the Mary
                     Caroline Stevens with a Bill of Lading directed to William
                     Douglass care of Mr. Saunders A. Campion.</p>

                  <p>Having recently arrived to Liberia from Virginia, Douglass
                     informs Dr. Minor and Frank Nelson of those who have died
                     from the perilous acclimating fever. In order to protect
                     his own health Douglass explains that he had to leave the
                     coast for higher elevations because he thinks it "imprudent
                     for persons raised on high lands to settle on the Coast."
                     Douglass requests a series of items including money. He
                     asks that all the goods be sent with "separate and
                     different receipts" so that, unlike the previous shipment,
                     each person will know exactly what is coming to them.
                     Douglass thinks the country is delightful, and explains
                     that with industry they have a good chance to survive and
                     if they do not improve "it will be our own fault." He
                     voices his community's determination to cultivate their new
                     country with the foundations of God and education despite
                     their hardships of sickness and insufficient tools.</p>

                     elevation of the mountain has been very good for his
                     family's and community's health. The rest of the letter
                     discusses the process of building the community: building
                     houses, the Union Church. Douglass asks the Reverend to

                     the previous letter in barrels and to direct them to

                     Stevens has completed her route to Liberia and now waits in
                     the port of Monrovia for her return trip home. Douglass
                     says that all are doing tolerably well, although Robinson
                     Scott's family, who have remained in Clay Ashland, are
                     "much reduced." Log cabins have been built and provide
                     comfortable living. The land has been well-planted with
                     "potatoes, cassavas, eddoes, tomatoes, lima beans," and
                     some "coffee trees." Douglass tells Minor of their past due
                     accounts on lumber and gives him a list of moneys due to
                     each member. Douglass sends thanks for the recently
                     received articles which he had asked for in a previous
                     letter. He also regrets to mention recent deaths at Clay
                     Ashland: Mollie Michie, Patty Walker and Syphon Terrell.
                     The letter ends with Douglass sending his love to "all the
                     Colored folks and to his dear old aunt Rachel who, he says,
                     is "too old to scuffle to make a living here."</p>

                  <p>This letter describes the writer's general health. She also
                     describes the types of vegetables and fruits grown in Clay
                     Ashland. Since she has not received groceries except for a
                     barrel of flour, and meat is scarce, she requests that she
                     be sent the following staples: pork, fish, sugar, soap,
                     butter, and additional flour. She also requests to be sent
                     calico and gingham fabric with which to make her sons some
                     clothing.</p>

                     Careysburg, Liberia after her husband's death. She requests
                     news from both Mr. and Mrs. Lewis as well as news of other
                     slaves remaining in Virginia and sends word to "federick"

                     their children have not forgotten them; and to other slaves
                     to not forget her and write soon. At the end she states

                  <p>Washington Michie explains that, although many people have
                     written to James Minor, he is writing to keep Dr. Minor
                     from thinking badly of him. He then requests supplies: a
                     barrel of corn meal, a barrel of pork, a box of men's
                     shoes, a box of leaf tobacco, some fabric for pants, four
                     umbrellas, and a barrel of fish. A calligraphic ornament
                     separates this from the next section, in which he tells of
                     receiving his land, which he hopes to improve, and reports
                     that the others have also received theirs, 30 acres each
                     and a town lot. They intend to raise cotton, he continues,
                     and requests that his best respects be relayed to Aunt
                     Rachel (he asks her to pray for him and assures her that he
                     will try to do the same), to A. Johnson, to Ri Reply, and

                  <p>Lucy Twine's letter is likely addressed to Dr. Minor since
                     the majority of the letter is a list of needed articles
                     such as bacon, tobacco, cloth, etc. Lucy also mentions an
                     "unexpended portion of money" that is due to her and the
                     rest of the colonists. At the end of this very short letter
                     she sends love to Aunt Rachel and Martha.</p>

                  <p>Mildred Carr informs Dr. Minor that the ship, presumably
                     the Mary Caroline Stevens, is about to return to Virginia.
                     The writer is upset that other women received more cloth
                     and clothing than she did in the last shipment. She asks
                     for more cloth and clothing for herself and children. She
                     asks the Dr. to send her love to Aunt Rachel, Brother
                     Billy, and Joe since she does not have the time to write
                     them due to her washing and ironing for the society. In a
                     postscript she mentions the newly dead: Sister Rachel and
                     Thomas Scott.</p>

                     been selling potatoes and other crops, including coffee and
                     tobacco. He asks that "White Stem Seed tobacco" be sent in
                     the next shipment. He mentions that the population is now
                     150. In his closing, Douglass tells of his journey to
                     Monrovia and writes that "they do things up like you White
                     People." He ends by telling Dr. Minor he is now Justice of
                     the Peace and is learning to write but as of yet is unable
                     to send a letter by his own hand.</p>

                  <p>Enclosed in this letter are two notes from Maria Barrett.
                     She wishes Dr. Minor well and asks him to send her nails,
                     linen, drill for pantaloons, and tobacco, among other minor
                     requested items. She suggests that there is some urgent
                     need for the listed goods. Maria informs Dr. Minor that she
                     and her family are in good health and even though Charles
                     and Richard Barrett have had ulcers on their feet for
                     nearly two years, they are doing much better. Maria laments
                     that she has not found anyone to suit her since the passing
                     of her husband. She closes the letter by informing Dr.
                     Minor that Mary has had twins, one of whom has died.</p>

                  <p>J. H. Paxton gives an extensive list of the types of cloth

                     grandchild, the Coleman family, Adeline Southall, and Lucy
                     Twine. Mr. Paxton is indebted to Dr. Minor for the shipped
                     merchandise but reminds Dr. Minor that if an invoice is not
                     included with a shipment of merchandise it is subject to
                     opening by the Customs house. Mr. Paxton's letter concludes

                  <p>Douglass informs Dr. Minor of his family's state of affairs
                     and then wonders why it has been almost four years since
                     Dr. Minor has written. Douglass admits he is over anxious
                     about Minor's silence especially since the Civil War is now
                     over. He explains that his farming of sugar cane is going
                     very well but wishes he could enjoy this new country with
                     his children who are still in Virginia. This separation, he
                     explains, is one of the hardest afflictions to bear
                     especially since he sent Dr. James Hall gold for the
                     purchase of them and has never had a response. He states he
                     is ready to receive his children since his house is now
                     finished but he is impatient to know what has become of
