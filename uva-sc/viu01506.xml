      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The majority of the material in this collection is loose in
         a scrapbook entitled "Augusta Military Academy/1874/Ad Astra
         Per Aspera," kept by William P. Tannehill while a student
         there during the 1920s. The scrapbook contains signatures and
         comments of friends, memorabilia, advertisements, athletic
         schedules, programs for various activities, two AMA insignia,
         an ROTC shoulder patch, art work on envelopes sent to
         Tannehill, photographs of AMA and the cadets and friends, and
         logos of various educational institutions.</p>
      <p>Correspondence of the Bowling family includes letters to
         Miss Gertrude E. Bowling from G[ivens] B[rown] Strickler
         (1840- ), March 28, 1877; Alexander Sprunt (1852-1937),
         October 18, 1880; and, Lytie Crawford in Henderson, North
         Carolina, n.d. [ca. 1885], concerning Alexander Sprunt and
         family and personal news.</p>
      <p>Correspondence of William P. Tannehill include a letter,
         September 28, 1931, from Hunter B. Blakely, Pastor of the
         First Presbyterian Church in Staunton, Virginia, welcoming him
         into the membership of the church; correspondence, July 1937,
         from Holly Stover, Washington, D.C., enclosing letters of
         introduction for Tannehill who has been engaged to make some
         coal contacts for Holly Stover, Inc.; and, letters, July 1937,
         concerning the Grand Caverns sign.</p>
      <p>There is also a letter, December 1, 1876, from M. M.
         Walker, surgeon at the Virginia State Penitentiary, to James
         Lawson Kemper, Governor of Virginia, providing a detailed
         report on the amount of space available per inmate, indicating
         that the measurements of the main building are less than
         appropriate.</p>
      <p>Other material removed from the scrapbook pertain to
         Augusta Military Academy, Fort Defiance, Virginia, and include
         programs for dances, dinners, and commencement and final
         exercises, baseball and football schedules, postcards of AMA,
         copies of The Bayonet (school publication), and a list of
         [cadets]. In addition, there is a three-page debate speech on
         "the raising of a bonus for the ex-soldiers" by Cadet Corporal
         Drum Major Tannehill. There are also miscellaneous items
         including advertisements (cards, pamphlets); a report,
         November 1, 1888, of Cadet Tannehill at Virginia Military
         Institute; a pamphlet, "Female Influence and Obligations..."
         by Rev. Nathan S. S. Beman; a two-page AMs of verse from
         Cowper's translation of The Iliad and Odyssey of Homer; and,
         unidentified photographs. Social memorabilia contains programs
         for a meeting of the Virginia State Union American Society of
         Equity for July 26 &amp; 27, 1906, for Mary Baldwin College
         graduates' recitals for May 20-25, 1925, and for "Monsieur
         Beaucaire," a comedy in three acts by Booth Tarkington,
         performed on May 22, 1925.</p>
