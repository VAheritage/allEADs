      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection consists of ca. 100 items. Approximately
         one-third of the collection is correspondence (1824-1902) to
         and from Rutherfoord, Coles, and Johnson family members. The
         remaining items include a thirty-page manuscript memoir,
         miscellaneous printed materials, and Christmas cards dating
         from the late nineteenth century.</p>
      <p>The earliest correspondence relates to the Rutherfoords, a
         prominent Virginia family whose members included John
         Rutherfoord, governor of Virginia, 1841-1842. Although
         mentioned in several of the letters, and the author of one,
         John Rutherfoord is not the major focus of the correspondence.
         His son, John C. Rutherfoord, is. Letters to John C.
         Rutherfoord, primarily from his sisters and mother, contain
         informal family musings, as well as evocations of the social
         scene in antebellum Charleston and Richmond. In general,
         family health, courtships, and weddings of friends, and local
         news are the most common topics of discussion in the
         Rutherfoord correspondence. Occasionally, political and
         economic matters receive attention (e.g. Helen C. Rutherfoord
         to John C. Rutherfoord, 10 March 1845; Emily A. Rutherfoord to
         John C. Rutherfoord, 13 May 1847.)</p>
      <p>The recipient of much of the correspondence, John C.
         Rutherfoord, was a graduate student at the University of
         Virginia in the early 1840s. (Like his father, Rutherfoord was
         a Princeton alumnus). Apparently the younger John
         Rutherfoord's career ambitions were uncertain during and
         beyond his days as a graduate student. His mother wrote to his
         sister Sally Bennett in 1847 that she hoped her son would take
         up law "or he will have to try the excitement of ploughing."
         Rutherfoord did take up law, and became a prominent attorney
         and politician in his native Virginia. He was a representative
         in the House of Delegates from Goochland County.</p>
      <p>Some of Rutherfoord's correspondence--e.g. George F.
         Harrison to Rutherfoord, 22 January 1861 (misdated
         1860)--relates to matters of public import. One of these
         letters, from G.A. Seddon to Rutherfoord, 9 November 1860,
         offers a sense of the Southern mind at this time. Viz:
         "Lincoln is absolutely elected and if we have the lameness to
         submit we have a Yankee and Abolition master and every
         probability at no distinct day of feeling the oppresive hand
         on our property and person....My view of the present is
         disconsoling and my anticipations of the future even more
         gloomy...."</p>
      <p>Also in the collection is a letter from John Rutherfoord,
         Sr. to John C. from Charleston, S.C., on the eve of the
         shelling of Fort Sumter. The letter, dated 1 April 1861,
         recounts a visit Rutherfoord, Sr. had recently made to the
         site. "We were," he wrote, "very close to Fort Sumpter [sic].
         I could have fired a pistol into it and counted every gun. We
         sailed nearly around it, and stood still while some of the
         time viewing it, our Band playing all the while 'Dixie Land'--
         I could not help thinking at the time, how completely one well
         directed cannon from the fort might have spoiled our fun."</p>
      <p>Some letter make references to the war: Mary H. Bennett to
         "My Dear Aunt and Uncle" (Mr. and Mrs. Rutherfoord, Sr.), 27
         October 1863; Mary H. Bennett to "My Dear Em" 2 February 1865;
         and Mrs. Sarah Bruce to Mrs. John C. Rutherfoord, 22 December
         1865. Other letters to Mrs. Rutherfoord discuss her husband's
         health (S. Bruce to Ann Rutherfoord, 17 July 1866) and offer
         sympathy upon his death (same to same, 6 October 1866).</p>
      <p>The collection also contains a scattering of Johnson family
         correspondence, focused around Bradley T. Johnson and his wife
         Jane Claudia Saunders Johnson. A native of Frederick,
         Maryland, Bradley Johnson was active in Democratic politics
         and the secession movement in Maryland. He served as a
         Confederate officer (and was made brigadier general in
         1864)during the war. His wife, a member of a prominent North
         Carolina family, was also active on behalf of the Confederate
         cause, and for her services in securing clothing and munitions
         for Southern forces was affectionately nicknamed "Mrs.
         Captain" (later "Mrs. General").</p>
      <p>A thirty-three page memoir which Jane Johnson apparently
         wrote in the 1890s provides background on her family and that
         of her husband, as well as details on their activities during
         the war and their participation in the "Association of the
         Maryland Line," a commemmorative organization, after the
         war.</p>
      <p>In addition to the memoir, the collection contains
         scattered Johnson correspondence, nine Christmas cards
         addressed ot the Johnsons in the late nineteenth century,
         miscellaneous printed materials, newspaper clippings, and a
         religious oriented commonplace book (ca. 1860-1890).</p>
