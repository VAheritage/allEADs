         <head>Scope and Content
</head>
         <p>This daybook, 1825-1827, of a retail store and tavern kept by Henry Dickenson, Sr., of Dickensonville, Russell County, Virginia, also contains pages entitled "Vatt Book," 835-1836, concerning a tannery. The
volume was also apparently used later as a practice penmanship workbook by a Dickenson family member.
</p>
         <p>Henry Dickenson, Sr. (ca. 1750-ca. 1827) was appointed Clerk of the Court in Russell County, and as such, had to be present at all times. The Court had been holding its meetings at the house of William
Roberson, and during the June term [1786], William Roberson and Henry Dickenson offered land for a county seat, and also offered to build a courthouse on the land and present it to the county. The commissioners
accepted the plan, and the court buildings were completed and used from September 20, 1787 until September 28, 1798 when the county seat was moved to Lebanon. While the courthouse was in Dickensonville, adjacent
to Dickenson's cabin, he was allowed to supplement his income by keeping a retail store and tavern in the building.
