      <p>This collection consists of letters from 2nd Lt. Overton C.
         Elkins, of Nashville, Tennessee, to his wife, Mary Elizabeth
         (Sharp) Overton, with an occasional letter to his
         mother-in-law, Mrs. Vernon H. Sharp, Sr., 205 items, (1.5
         Hollinger boxes) 1944-1945. Overton C. Elkins, son of George
         W. Elkins of Nashville, graduated from Montgomery Bell
         Academy, and worked for the Gray, Shillinglaw &amp; Company
         prior to his service in the Army. These letters mainly discuss
         Elkins' experiences at the Officer Candidate School in Miami
         Beach, and as an officer at the Langley Air Field, Virginia.
         Elkins apparently entered the Army in 1942 October, but only
         his correspondence as an officer candidate and 2nd Lt. officer
         is present in this collection.</p>
      <p>His correspondence begins with a postcard written on a
         train to Miami, dated January 7, 1944, and continues with a
         letter written from Smyrna, Tennessee, on January 8th, while
         he is en route to the Air Forces Officer Candidate School
         located at Miami Beach, Florida. During his participation in
         this school, he stayed at the Greystone Hotel, Miami Beach. In
         these early letters, he describes his difficult schedule and
         the terrible treatment by the upperclassmen who run the entire
         school, including "bracing," the exaggerated standing at
         attention and "wracking back," being bawled out by the
         upperclassmen (1944 Jan 16, 27).</p>
      <p>He was assigned to Squadron 5, Class 44-E, and continues
         his description of his rigorous military and academic schedule
         (Jan 19); his first guard duty and more of his hectic routine
         (Jan 21); description of his class work (Feb 3, 16, 18, 24);

         29th (Mar 27; Apr 2); and expresses his love and appreciation
         for his wife of almost nine years and encloses a copy of the
         Bivouac Beacon (Mar 25).</p>
      <p>Elkins makes plans for the visit of his wife before
         graduation and studying for the final examination (Apr 2, 3,
         9); Lt. Elkins becomes a member of the 111th AAF Base Unit,

         surgeon at the base (Jun 12); description of his duty as
         "officer of the day" and the new assignment as insurance

         some of the buildings of the National Advisory Committee on
         Aeronautics where stress tests are conducted on aircraft (Sep
         30).</p>
      <p>Elkins' letters to the end of the year discuss his position
         as acting commanding officer of his section, with examples of
