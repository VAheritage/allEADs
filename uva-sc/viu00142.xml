      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p><persname>Beverley Dandridge Tucker III</persname>was born on
         August 25, 1925, in 
         <geogname>Shanghai, China</geogname>, where his father 
         <persname>Augustine Washington Tucker</persname>was a surgeon
         at the Christian hospital of 
         <corpname>St. Luke's</corpname>. Tucker received his A.B. from
         <corpname>Harvard</corpname>in 1949 and an A.M. in 1958; he
         received a divinity degree from 
         <corpname>Virginia Theological Seminary</corpname>in 1952.
         After language school at 
         <corpname>Yale</corpname>, Tucker left for 
         <geogname>Japan</geogname>in January, 1953, as an Episcopal
         missionary priest. He spent another year at 
         <geogname>Kobe</geogname>in further language training and
         received his ordination in the spring of 1954; at the same
         time he began his assignment as rector of 
         <corpname>St. Michael's Church</corpname>in 
         <geogname>Sapporo, Hokkaido</geogname>.</p>
      <p>At that time 
         <geogname>Hokkaido</geogname>was the weakest diocese in the
         indigenous Episcopal church or Nippon Sei Kokai. There were
         nineteen churches in the diocese but only nine priests, four
         of whom were near or past retirement age. Because of this
         shortage of Episcopal priests in post-war 
         <geogname>Japan</geogname>, the indigenous church called on
         young American seminarians for relief. Tucker always pointed
         out, however, that he and the other American priests were
         serving at the invitation of the Japanese church under
         Japanese bishops and not as traditional missionaries.</p>
      <p><corpname>St. Michael's</corpname>had been started by a group
         of young men from 
         <corpname>Hokkaido University</corpname>who had recently
         converted to Christianity. They bought land and built a small
         church building and notified the bishop that they needed a
         rector. Thus Tucker came to 
         <corpname>St. Michael's</corpname>. Beside his work in the
         parish church, Tucker served as the chaplain for the 
         <corpname>Fukujuen Children's Home</corpname>and the 
         <corpname>Misawa Tuberculosis Sanatorium</corpname>, and began
         missions in 
         <geogname>Bibai</geogname>, a small coal-mining area, and in 
         <geogname>Wakkanai</geogname>, a fishing village at the
         northern end of 
         <geogname>Hokkaido</geogname>.</p>
      <p>While at 
         <corpname>St. Michael's</corpname>Tucker wrote two books: 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">God Gave the Increase</title></bibref>, which told the story of 
         <corpname>St. Michael's Church</corpname>, and 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Questions on the Way</title></bibref>, a modern catechism especially for use in countries
         with a non-Judeo-Christian cultural background. In 1959 he
         married 
         <persname>Jean Evelyn Morris</persname>with whom he had three
         children. In 1959 Tucker left the parish of 
         <corpname>St. Michael's</corpname>in capable Japanese hands
         and began teaching at 
         <geogname>Kyoto</geogname>'s 
         <corpname>Bishop William Seminary</corpname>in 1969. In 1984
         he also began teaching at 
         <corpname>Doshisha University</corpname>, likewise in 
         <geogname>Kyoto</geogname>, in which two positions he remains
         at present. Tucker has also assisted in 
         <geogname>Kyoto</geogname>'s Episcopal churches, and has
         authored several books in the past two decades.</p>
      <p>From the time of his arrival in 
         <geogname>Japan</geogname>, Tucker sent mimeographed circular
         letters back home to "Family and Friends." Some of these
         letters were collected by 
         <persname>Betty Cocke</persname>of 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>. This collection consists
         of 26 letters, 4 printed Christmas cards, 2 photographs, a
         wedding announcement, and a copy of 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">God Gave the Increase</title></bibref>. Besides detailing the life and activities of his
         family and parish, Tucker used the monthly letters to instruct
         his readers on Japanese life, commenting on some larger aspect
         of his work and making astute reflections on Japanese
         culture.</p>
      <p>The collection contains one monthly letter from December,
         1961, ten letters and two Christmas cards from 1962, nine
         letters and two Christmas cards from 1963, and six letters
