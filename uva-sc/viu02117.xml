         <p>Kate (Flanagan) Coles was born on January 7 (or 17?), 1856
         or 1857 at "Gale Hill," the home of William Wardlaw Minor in
         Albemarle County, Virginia. She was the daughter of James and
         Ann (Johnson) Flanagan, the coachman and seamstress at "Gale
         Hill." James Flanagan's mother was "Mammy Kate," the
         housekeeper for Richmond Terrell at "Glen Echo" after the
         marriage of his daughter, Mary Waters Terrell, to William
         Wardlaw Minor. James Flanagan came to "Gale Hill" with Mary
         Waters Terrell after her marriage and married Ann, the
         daughter of Judy Johnson, a Minor servant who had always lived
         at "Gale Hill." Judy Johnson was first taken into the house as
         a young nurse and eventually became head seamstress, as did
         her daughter Ann. James and Ann Flanagan lived in the "old
         double quarters" at "Gale Hill" until they moved into their
         own home near Proffit, Virginia, after the Civil War.</p>
         <p>Kate Flanagan was one of the last blacks born at "Gale
         Hill" before emancipation and was taught to read and write by
         Malvina "Mal" Terrell, aunt of Mary Waters (Terrell) Minor,
         who taught school for both blacks and whites at "Gale Hill."
         She moved to Proffit with her parents where she married Jeff
         Coles. She and Jeff had six children: James, Jeff "Jeppey,"
         Hastings, Carry, William, and Olive. Kate Coles died on April
         12, 1943.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection consists of ca. 80 items, 1913 to 1940,
         relating to Kate (Flanagan) Coles, one of the last slaves born
         before emancipation at "Gale Hill," Albemarle County,
         Virginia, home of William Wardlaw Minor. Approximately 70
         letters are from Kate Coles to numerous members of the Bryan
         family, primarily Margaret Randolph (Minor) Bryan and her
         daughters. In several instances, Mrs. Coles wrote her letters
         on the verso of letters written to her, so that both sides of
         the correspondence appear. The letters contain family news but
         are also of interest in revealing the relationship between
         blacks and whites in Virginia during the early twentieth
         century. In addition to Margaret Bryan, correspondents include
         her daughters, Margaret R. (Bryan) Williston, Evelyn (Bryan)
         Bullitt, Elizabeth Coalter (Bryan) Williston, and Isobel
         Stewart (Bryan) Richmond, and two of Evelyn's children, James
         and Margaret Bullitt. Also included in the collection is a
         75-page typed transcript of many of Kate Cole's letters from
         this collection, along with several letters from accessions
         #10322-a and #10322-b.</p>
         <p>Eight letters, 1913 to 1916, are from William Wardlaw Minor
         II of "Windieknowe" in Albemarle County, Virginia, to his
         brother, Richmond T. Minor and to his sister. They deal mainly
         with family matters, crops, books, religion, and politics.
         "Windieknowe" was purchased around 1840 by Richmond Terrell of
         Louisa County, Virginia, but he soon traded it to his
         son-in-law, William Wardlaw Minor of "Gale Hill," for "Glen
         Echo," so that Terrell could live near his daughter at Gale
         Hill.</p>
