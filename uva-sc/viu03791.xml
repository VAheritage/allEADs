</head>
         <p>James Agee (1909-1955), author, playwright, and critic, was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, attended Phillips Exeter Academy and graduated from Harvard in 1932. His first and only book of verse, <title render="italic">Permit Me Voyage</title>, was published in 1934. He joined the editorial staff of Fortune magazine in 1932, wrote for <title render="italic">Time</title> Magazine, and reviewed films for the
Nation, <title render="italic">Partisan Review</title>, <title render="italic">Harper's</title>, and the <title render="italic">Forum</title>. A 1936 assignment with <title render="italic">Fortune</title>
concerning poor white sharecroppers in the South led to the publication of his book <title render="italic">Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</title> (with photographs by Walker Evans) in 1941. Agee showed great insight
and compassion in his works.

         <head>Scope and Content
</head>
         <p>Included are two autograph manuscripts, [1930s?], by James Agee. In the two-page analysis of his first book and only volume of poetry, <title render="italic">Permit Me Voyage</title>, Agee describes the
background of his poems, often giving the specific circumstances under which they were composed and assesses the quality of his work. The one-page draft of an article on the Tennessee Valley Authority is comprised
of four variant drafts of the opening paragraph showing Agee's mixed feelings toward the public works project.
