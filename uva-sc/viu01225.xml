      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of electrostatic copies of about
         300 items, 1763-1852, chiefly the business and financial
         letters, accounts, and legal documents of Joseph Watkins of
         "[Janetoe]," Goochland County, Virginia, apparently a surveyor
         and tobacco agent, and son of Benjamin and Jane Watkins. The
         collection also includes some papers of David Shields, of
         Cartersville, Cumberland County, Virginia, and Dr. Thomas P.
         Watkins, Goochland County, Virginia. Many of the earlier
         letters, ca. 1770-1802, are from Thomas Mann Randolph to his
         tobacco agent, Joseph Watkins, concerning tobacco sales, land
         deals, surveys, and land plats, and the estate of his father,
         Thomas Mann Randolph, Sr. Most of the correspondence deals
         with legal and business matters.</p>
      <p>Other topics which occur in the letters include: Indians
         killing eighteen out of nineteen men employed in cutting hay
         at Ft. Jefferson, [Kentucky?] (1792 Jul 8); slave hires listed
         by name (1796 [Feb?] 1); references to Thomas Jefferson by
         Thomas Mann Randolph (1796 Oct 17, 1797 Mar 31; 1799 May 26);
         complaints that treaties with the Indians have decreased the
         amount of land available for land grants to the military (1796
         Dec 6); the slaves Randal and Daniel (1798 Jan 18); fears
         about the possible effects of an embargo upon the sale of
         flour and other goods (1798 Mar 15; 1801 Jan 1); and a printed
         circular discussing differences between the United States and
         France (Philadelphia, 1798 April 6).</p>
      <p>Additional topics include: a request of money from the
         estate of Thomas Mann Randolph and a record of the account
         (1798 Jul 9; 1799 Dec 25); a survey of land sold to Thomas
         Mann Randolph by the late Richard Randolph of Curles and a
         discussion of named slaves (1799 Feb 11); the importance of
         exchanging, by the next election, "the anti-Federal and weak
         members" in Congress for "men more attached to our good
         government, and more able to de[fine] our true interests" such
         as General Marshall (1799 Apr 2); and a proposed method to
         settle military lands on the banks of the Ohio with New
         England farmers (1799 May 16).</p>
      <p>Other subjects mentioned in these papers include: offer of
         partnership in the Dover Mill and problems with its operation
         (1800 Sep 13; 1801 Jan 8); the slaves of George Underwood
         unwilling to be hired out as blacksmith's helpers (1800 Oct
         26); Watkins' saltpeter cave in Bath County, Virginia, and the
         last election results, including 112 for Thomas Jefferson and
         52 for John Adams (1800 Nov 9); three slaves named at the
         Cumberland County plantation (1800 Dec 2); discussion of the
         character of a slave, Janey (1801 Jan 10); purchase of Albion
         Mills and determination by Thomas Rutherford to sell the Dover
         plantation "because I feel day by day a greater repugnance to
         owning Negroes" ( 1801 Jan 13); and the Thomas Mann Randolph,
         Sr. estate, with Joseph Watkins as the agent for the executors
         (1801 Feb, May 10).</p>
      <p>Other topics are: the death of the wife of David Shields
         (1801 May 2); the estate of Thomas Mann Randolph and a suit
         between the executors and creditors (1802 Feb 26, Oct 16; 1803
         May 5); the sale of the Randolph farm on the banks of the
         James River below "Tuckahoe" (1802 Apr 15); the wish of Mr.
         Monroe to purchase a lot on Shockhoe Hill, Richmond (1802 May
         20); T.M. Randolph's comments about the Louisiana Purchase
         Treaty before Congress and Spain's fears about American
         settlement near her Mexican subjects (1803 Oct 22); a slave
         list from the estate of Joel Redding (1804 Jan 20); the Varina
         tract of land for sale (1804 Feb 6); and the death and estate
         of Joseph Watkins (1804 Nov 26; 1805 Dec 10).</p>
      <p>Other subjects of interest include: William and Mary
         lottery tickets (1805 May 23); the hiring of slaves Charles,
         Wilson, and Hatty (1829 Nov 6, Dec 10; 1830 Nov 9); the
         drowning of David Shields, the brother of A.W. Shields, in the
         Tuckahoe Creek (1833 Dec 21); the plans of Robert S. Madison
         to attend the University of Virginia and the possibility of
         war with Mexico (1845 Sep 16).</p>
      <p>Other letters from Robert S. Madison to Thomas P. Shields
         cover the years 1845-1848. Undated items include a letter
         about danger from the "British Horse " and the capture of
         sixty-five men from Colonel Goode's party; an almost illegible
         slave list; essays; and a "Slave Song."</p>
