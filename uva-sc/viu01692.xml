         <p>David Probert (1836?--?) resided in Jersey City and
         Patterson, New Jersey. He was employed in Tennessee by the
         Quartermaster Department of the District of Nashville as a
         carpenter from January 31 to April 1, 1864. Probert received
         an honorable discharge and eventually was hired by the Bridge
         Department of the United States Military Railroads in
         Alexandria, Virginia, on May 4, 1864 at the rate of $2.40 per
         day. During the period of his diary Probert was employed
         primarily at Alexandria and City Point. Accidentally injured
         in the leg on May 18, he resigned in October, 1864 to return
         to his home for recuperation. On November 21, 1864 he was
         hired by the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad Company.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection consists of ten items, 1864-1869, a
         manuscript diary and miscellaneous papers pertaining to David
         Probert of Patterson, New Jersey, a carpenter employed by the
         United States Military Railroads in Virginia during the Civil
         War. The diary itself is a small bound volume ("Diary 1864")
         of approximately forty pages. Researchers should note that
         several entries were not recorded on the appropriate daily
         page; a sequence guideline has been appended to this
         guide.</p>
         <p>The diary's entries are for the period of May 2 to
         September 1, 1864. The entries (which are brief due to space
         limitations inherent with the volume) discuss Probert's work
         and off-duty activities near or in Alexandria, Falmouth, Bell
         Plains, City Point, Mill Point, Fort Monroe, Aquia Creek,
         Petersburg, and the Appomattox River. He also mentions
         structures for he was assigned to repair (Long Bridge, Potomac
         Creek Bridge, Weldon Railroad) and the battles of Globe Tavern
         [also known as Weldon Railroad or Six Mile House] and the
         Petersburg Mine Explosion [the battle of the Crater].</p>
         <p>Probert describes his accident (May 18), burials of Union
         soldiers (June 5 &amp; 18), the arrival of the famous mortar
         "Dictator" (July 7), the murder of a soldier by another (July
         10), reactions to Jubal Early's Washington Raid (July 13 &amp;
         14), an explosion at City Point caused by Confederate sabotage
         (August 9), life in Alexandria and City Point, and
         construction work such as boat building (June 8). There are
         also references to blacks (May 16; July 3 &amp; 9),
         Confederate attacks (August 4, 9 &amp; 25), Union Generals
         Ulysses S. Grant (July 3 &amp; 4), Philip Sheridan (June 28),
         and George Meade (July 13 &amp; 28), a Lee Tuttle of the 2nd
         Ohio Cavalry (August 6), and his friends and members of his
         family. He comments on the prices he paid for boots, breakfast
         at Fort Monroe, watermelon, and a rubber blanket (June 16;
         July 20 &amp; 28; August 27). A slightly more detailed
         recounting of the August 9, 1864 explosion at City Point may
         be found on the final two pages of the diary.]</p>
         <p>Unrelated entries, 1864-1869, usually not in diary form,
         pertain to various accounts, expenditures, names and
         addresses; there are notations for stud activities of bulls,
         the cost of hay obtained for a church, hog killing, butter and
         milk production, prices for carpentry supplies, lists of
         letters sent and received, and similar miscellaneous
         notes.</p>
         <p>The remaining nine pieces are comprised of two receipts and
         a letter (November 3, 1863) concerning transactions between
         Probert and the Adams Express Company; a certificate of
         enrollment from the provost marshal's office in Nashville
         bearing a physical description of Probert; his honorable
         discharge which qualified him for transportation at half-fare
         (April 1, 1864); his oath of allegiance (May 4, 1864); a pass
         for him and five others to visit Petersburg (August 7); a
         permit which allowed him to travel on U. S. military railroads
         (October 14 1864); and, a 1871 obituary published in the 
         <title render="italic">Toledo Blade</title>concerning the
         death of his father, Thomas, in Sylvania, Ohio.</p>
