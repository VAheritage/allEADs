      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of the personal and academic
         correspondence of John Cook Wyllie and Fillmore Norfleet, 6
         items, 1933-1934, written during Norfleet's third year of
         study in France in pursuit of two graduate degrees in the
         Department of Romance Languages at the University of Virginia.
         Norfleet was researching the life of Balthazar Fevret de Saint
         Memin in his home city of Dijon after completing his study of
         his American career. Because of continual frustration in his
         research of Saint Memin, John Cook Wyllie, who was studying at
         the Biblioteque Nationale the summer and fall of 1933,
         suggested that Norfleet try another topic for his
         dissertation, the poet, prose satirist, and author of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Argenis</title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Satyricon</title>, John Barclay
         (1582- 1621).</p>
      <p>One interesting letter of Wyllie's, November 4, 1933,
         describes the results of some of his own research in France
         and has attached an eight page handwritten document by Wyllie
         entitled, "What I Know About Barclay." In another letter,
         November 28, 1933, written shortly before Wyllie left France,
         he mentions President Franklin D. Roosevelt, his former
         residence and acquaintances in the West Indies, and repeats
         his offers of assistance.</p>
      <p>In a third letter, January 6, 1934, Rehoboth, Delaware,
         Wyllie comments about Julien Green's books, "On the way back I
         read 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Mont-Cinere (Avarice House)</title>,
         and since arriving here I have read 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Closed Garden</title>. The 1st I
         read in France, the 2nd in England. I didn't like them. They
         are abnormal and unpleasant. Are the others better? These are
         the 1st things of Green's I have read. I should be ashamed of
         this probably." Also present is a letter in French to Fillmore
         Norfleet from an unidentified correspondent who is learning to
         speak and write English, postmarked [October 17, 1933].</p>
