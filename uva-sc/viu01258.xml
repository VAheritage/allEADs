      <p>Lucien W. Richardson enlisted at Williamsburg in May 1861
         as a member of the 1st Virginia Artillery, Co. B, James City
         Artillery, eventually reaching the rank of captain. (In some
         records Richardson's first name is spelled "Lucian.") He
         remained with this unit when it became the 1st Battalion
         Virginia Light Artillery, Co. B, James City Artillery and
         later an independent unit, Captain Lucien W. Richardson's
         Battery of Virginia Artillery. Detailed to enrolling duty in
         January 1863, Richardson's poor health led to his reassignment
         to duty in Richmond by order of the Confederate Secretary of
         War. By December 1863 Richardson was a staff officer for
         General John H. Winder (1800-1865), provost marshal of
         Richmond.</p>
      <p>Two June 1864 inspection reports describe Richardson as
         commandant of Castle Thunder (a Richmond prison part of the
         Easter District Military Prison system and used to house Union
         and political prisoners) in charge of three lieutenants and
         commended for his "most excellent system of records and
         registry . . . office books are neatly and accurately kept,
         and exhibit a complete and comprehensive record of each
         prisoner received." One inspection reported noted "Captain R.
         is applying to be retired." [Jeffrey C. Weaver,

      <p>This November 1864 manuscript document, "List of Slaves
         remaining at Eastern District. Military Prison Richmond Va.
         Nov. 30/ 64," is a list of twenty-nine recaptured slaves from
         Virginia, Maryland, Tennessee, North Carolina, Kentucky,
         Missouri, and Mississippi. Column headings include: "Names /
         Color / When committed / Age / Where arrested / Owners /
         Residence." L. W. Richardson has signed it as APM [Assistant
         Provost Marshal]; the verso file docket bears the notation:
         "List of Slaves remaining in E. D. M. Nov: 30th/64 given by
         Capt. Richardson Commdt [Commandant] of prison.//Two copies
         made out with proper heading &amp; conclusion for Prov:
         [Provost] Ml [Marshal] Dec. 20/64 for publication." Being held
         in various Confederate prisons in Richmond and advertised in
         city and state newspapers was customary for large numbers of
         recaptured runaway slaves so that their owners might reclaim
         them [Ervin L. Jordan Jr., 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Black Confederates and Afro-Yankees in
         Civil War Virginia</title>(Charlottesville and London:
         University Press of Virginia, 1995), 79-81].</p>
      <p>Most of the slaves have full names (some bear the same
         surname as their owner), range in age from twelve to seventy,
         and are described as black or mulatto; the majority were from
         Virginia and were transferred to the prison in November 1864.
         For unknown reasons check marks were placed before the names
         of Elijah (captured September 29, 1864), Ann Jones, and
         William Choate; the name of the last slave, Jasper (captured
         November 30, 1864), and that of his owner Peyton Johnston are
         crossed out.</p>
