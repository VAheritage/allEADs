      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Quinby Family Papers consists of ca. 1300 items (7
         Hollinger boxes and one oversize folder, 2.8 linear shelf
         feet, 1759(1800-1898)1968, papers of the Upshur, Teackle,
         Quinby, and other related families of the Eastern Shores of
         Maryland and Virginia, specifically Somerset County, Maryland,
         and Accomack and Northampton counties, Virginia. The
         collection includes correspondence, legal and finanical
         papers, a letterbook, ledgers and journals, class notebooks,
         commonplace books, genealogical information, prayerbooks, and
         memorandum books. The bulk of the collection consists of
         correspondence of Elizabeth (Upshur) Teackle, Littleton Dennis
         Teackle, Elizabeth Anne Upshur (Teackle) Quinby, Aaron
         Balderston Quinby, and Upshur Balderston Quinby with friends,
         family, and business associates.</p>
      <p>Much of the early correspondence, 1778 to 1799, is with
         Andrew D. Campbell. Campbell and his wife were British friends
         of the Teackles and Upshurs and he continued to write lengthy
         letters to members of these families until his death in
         1853.</p>
      <p>In 1800, Elizabeth Upshur (1783-1837) married Littleton
         Dennis Teackle (1777-1850) of Princess Anne, Somerset County,
         Maryland. Many of her letters from the period 1800-1837 were
         written to: her, husband; her daughter, Elizabeth Anne Upshur
         Teackle (1801-1875); and her sister, Anne Eyre of Northampton
         County, Virginia. These letters are of a personal nature but
         contain a few references to historical events, such as one of
         the British landings in the Chesapeake Bay area (Havre de
         Grace) in May 1813. One letter, dated December 2, 1778, from
         Nancy Cunningham (signed "Ruralinda") to Sally Teackle, has a
         note attached, written by Elizabeth Upshur Teackle on October
         1, 1829, which provides background on the 1778 letter. The
         letter refers to Nancy Cunningham's flight from Philadelphia
         in the Fall of 1777 or 1778 and to her later return and
         describes the whereabouts of Severn Teackle, who was being
         held as a prisoner of war by the British on Long Island in New
         York.</p>
      <p>Littleton Dennis Teackle owned and managed a ship supply
         company in Princess Anne, Somerset County, Maryland, from 1805
         to 1807. A letterbook from that business contains a great deal
         of historical information relating to the period prior to the
         War of 1812. It describes Teackle's business and lists
         materials he supplied, such as wooden structural components
         for ships, makes references to domestic and foreign affairs,
         and contains many other details relating to his daily business
         operations during this period.</p>
      <p>Apparently Mr. Teackle was away from home much of the time
         between 1807 and 1815 and between 1824 and 1836. During the
         earlier period he may have been involved in a shipping
         business with headquarters in Baltimore; he was a member of
         the Maryland House of Delgates during the later period.</p>
      <p>Included in Teackle's unbound correspondence is a letter
         from Henry Clay written in 1825 regarding paper money and
         another from James Madison on primary schools in Maryland
         written in 1826, in which he states some of his views on
         education. In 1836 Teackle wrote to Thomas R. Joynes of
         Accomack County, Virginia, as a member of the Maryland House
         of Delegates, regarding that body's consideration of a plan to
         build a railroad through the Eastern Shore of Maryland. He
         presented this information in order that Mr. Joynes could, if
         he were agreeable, support the continuance of the road south
         to Norfolk, Virginia. A railroad was not actually built
         through this area until more than forty-five years later.</p>
      <p>Most of the material dated 1838-1853 consists of personal,
         business and legal business papers of Elizabeth Anne Upshur
         (Teackle) Quinby and her husband, Aaron Balderston Quinby
         (1795-1853), a Baltimore lawyer whom she married in 1839.
         Major correspondents include Henry Clay, dated 1842 on the
         Whig Party; Quinby's brother, Jesse B. Quinby, including on
         English investment in the U. S.; and the Reverend J. W.
         Hoffman, a minister in Monroe, Connecticut, and a friend of
         the family. Material from this period includes several letters
         from United States representative Issac D. Jones and others to
         Secretary of State Daniel Webster, recommending Aaron B.
         Quinby for an appointment in the United States Patent Office,
         and correspondence of Quinby with representatives of the U.S.
         Navy, including James K. Paulding, George E. Badger and James
         Biddle, whom he was asking to test and adopt his invention to
         prevent steam boiler explosions. Also included is an 1841
         letter to Charles Stewart regarding ship propeller.</p>
      <p>Between 1854 and 1875, Elizabeth A. U. Quinby corresponded
         with relatives and friends, such as Henrietta Chauncey, C.E.
         Le Cato and a Mrs. C. Williams.</p>
      <p>Aaron B. Quinby's legal papers include a copy of his will,
         powers of attorney to collect property for clients, and his
         claim to property in the possessions of his wife's father. One
         power of attorney concerns lands in the Virginia Military
         District in the State of Ohio which were acquired as an award
         for service rendered by a soldier during the Revolution.</p>
      <p>Much of the personal correspondence between 1860 and 1897
         is that of Upshur Balderston Quinby (1841-1898), son of Mrs.
         Elizabeth A. U. and Aaron B. Quinby. Upshur Quinby attended
         the University of Virginia (1860-1861), and later became a
         highly respected lawyer in Onancock, Virginia. He and
         Georgeanna ("Georgie") Richardson (1845-1896) were married in
         1864 and had seven children.</p>
      <p>Upshur Quinby's early correspondence with his mother
         includes references to his life as a student at the University
         of Virginia, such as a description of a hike to "Monticello,"
         and records rumored and actual events at the beginning of the
         Civil War. In 1879 Mr. Quinby was involved with the Onancock
         Academy in Onancock, Accomack County, Virginia. Related
         correspondence includes letters from applicants for teaching
         positions and recommendations in support of several of them
         from Professor John B. Minor of the University of
         Virginia.</p>
      <p>Quinby was a candidate for judge of the Eastern Shore
         Circuit in 1880 and his correspondence for that year includes
         letters of support from friends and associates including:
         Charles U. Williams; G. W. Le Cato; L. R. Warren; Robert
         Thruston Hubard; Judge John M. Jeffries; John B. Minor;
         Richard Lee Tuberville Beale of the U. S. House of
         Representatives; and W. W. Walker. Several of these promised
         to recommend him to the governor of Virginia, Frederick W. M.
         Holliday.</p>
      <p>Quinby's personal correspondence from 1883 to 1897 consists
         chiefly of letters from relatives and friends, such as Adaline
         M. Swarts, Dr. W. F. Quinby, I. W. Quinby, and L. D. Teackle
         Quinby, and includes many letters concerned with genealogy. In
         1896 Quinby received many letters of condolence on Mrs.
         Quinby's death.</p>
      <p>Most of Upshur B. Quinby's legal and financial papers,
         which date fron 1828 to 1894, pertain to properties which he
         and Mrs. Quinby owned in Accomack County, Virginia. The papers
         include deeds, copies of deeds, land records, and receipts for
         purchases of building materials. Included in this section is
         some of the Quinby's professional correspondence relating to
         general legal claims and debt collection.</p>
      <p>The genealogical material in this collection includes
         information regarding the related Andrews, Balderston,
         Scarburgh, Stockley, Sturges, Teackle, Upshur, Walter, and
         West families, dating back to the 16th century. Much of the
         correspondence dating from 1886 to 1931 contains family
         information, probably in response to inquiries from Upshur
         Quinby. The genealogy section of the collection contains the
         baptismal certificate of Upshur B. Quinby, birth and death
         records from a family bible, notes, charts, and newspaper
         clippings. Other genealogical information appears in a psalter
         and a Book of Common Prayer which also contains slave records,
         the three commonplace books, and the oversize material.</p>
      <p>The bound volumes include two commonplace books of poems
         written by Elizabeth U. Teackle and her daughter and thirteen
         record books kept by Upshur B. Quinby. The latter include
         three University of Virginia class notebooks; four memoranda
         book which are almost indecipherable; two account books
         containing records of fees paid to the Onancock Academy; and
         three books containing financial accounts of Quinby's farm and
         legal practice.</p>
