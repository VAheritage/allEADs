        <p>These items were purchased by the University of Virginia
            Library on October 28, 1993, from Trevor Philip &amp; Sons
            Ltd, London, England, as an addition to the Hamond Naval
            Papers of the McGregor Library.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This addition to the Hamond family papers, 1790-1822, and
         1862, ca. fifteen items, includes maps, printed books, a
         midshipman's chest, a naval officer's code book, genealogical
         manuscripts and other documents, and artifacts belonging to
         Sir Andrew Snape Hamond (1738-1828), and to his son, Sir
         Graham Eden Hamond (1779-1862). The midshipman's chest, owned
         by Admiral Sir Graham Hamond, (which has been stored in the
         new stacks with the other trunks) bears a hand written
         clothing inventory dated September 1819 on the interior of the
         lid. A transcript of this inventory is included as an appendix
         to this guide and a color photograph of the interior of the
         lid of the chest and the list of clothing is also present in
         the collection.</p>
      <p>Manuscripts and documents include an oversize genealogical
         chart (1862) showing "the pedigree of the Hamond and Graeme
         families, with two smaller related genealogical charts; a
         "Memorandum of Sir Andrew Hamond's Family" also titled "Hamond
         of Hollygrove - Berkshire 1820," written by Sir Andrew Snape
         Hamond about his family; a certificate of appointment of Sir
         Andrew Snape Hamond to Commander in Chief of His Majesty's
         Ships and Vessels in the River Medway and at the Buoy of the
         Nore, June 22, 1785 (from 1785 until 1788); an invitation to
         dinner at the Mansion House, residence to the Lord Mayor, the
         Right Honorable Sir John Eamer, April 19, 1802; and a typed
         copy of a three page "Memorandum on the Papers of Sir Andrew
         Snape Hamond, Captain in the Royal Navy During the American
         Revolution."</p>
      <p>Also present in the collection is a leather bound naval
         officer's code book, dated 1790, specifying various signals,
         vanes of named vessels, and other information essential for
         naval communication; a wooden circular "box" made from "A
         piece of the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Golden Horse</title>of 46 guns, sunk as
         a Breakwater in 1688, discovered in 1822 excavating for the
         River Wall between the Second and New Docks in His Majesty's
         Dock Yard at Chatham"; and a leather bound notebook,
         1824-1825, showing the "Establishment of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">H.M.S. Wellesley</title>" commanded by
         Captain Graham Eden Hamond. This notebook, presumably kept by
         Graham Hamond, contains lists of furnishings and a record of
         provisions purchased for the ship; the dimensions of the
         vessel compared to others Hamond had commanded; and lists of
         the crew by name according to 1) class, ratings, number of
         men, 2) as "able seamen," "ordinary seamen," "landsmen," "boys
         first class," "boys second class," and "marines," 3) a "watch
         bill" listing the hours for each group on watch, and 4) the
         officer's stations.</p>
