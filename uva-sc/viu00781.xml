      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>In this collection are ca. 141 items, 1861 to 1876, which
         consist of mainly correspondence, with a few documents,
         pertaining to the Civil War between the 
         <geogname>United States</geogname>and the Confederacy. The
         material relates specifically to the course of the war as seen
         by the Army of Northern Virginia.</p>
      <p><persname>John Cowper Granbery</persname>, a Bishop of the 
         <corpname>Methodist Episcopal Church</corpname>, was born on
         December 5, 1829, in 
         <geogname>Norfolk, Virginia</geogname>. He joined the 
         <corpname>Methodist Episcopal Church</corpname>at the age of
         fourteen, and two years later he matriculated at 
         <corpname>Randolph-Macon College</corpname>, where he
         graduated in 1848. For the next thirteen years he served as a
         itinerant preacher and missionary. In the years immediately
         before the Civil War he served in these positions at the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>. He was a chaplain
         in the 
         <corpname>Confederate Army</corpname>from 1861-1865, and in
         1875 was appointed acting professor of mental and moral
         philosophy and professor of practical theology in the Biblical
         department of 
         <corpname>Vanderbilt University</corpname>, 
         <geogname>Nashville, Tennessee</geogname>. In 1882 he was
         elected Bishop of the 
         <corpname>Methodist Episcopal Church, South</corpname>. He was
         also appointed to the 
         <corpname>Board of Trustees of Vanderbilt
         University</corpname>in 1882. He married 
         <persname>Jennie Massie</persname>in 1858, who died a year
         later. He then married 
         <persname>Ella Winston</persname>in 1862.</p>
      <p><persname>John Cowper Granbery</persname>starts the period as
         an itinerant preacher and missionary at the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>. After the
         secession of the state of 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>in early 1861, he volunteered for
         chaplain duty in the army. On July 12, 1861, he received his
         commission as chaplain to the 
         <corpname>11th regiment, Army of Northern Virginia</corpname>.
         Although in different regiments, he served in this division
         throughout the war.</p>
      <p>The letters of February through May of 1861 deal with life
         at the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>, and the attitudes
         there toward the secession crisis. Different events of the
         period are described. The letters of July through October of
         the same year pertain to his joining the Army, and its
         preparations for war. Also discussed is the drudgery of camp
         life.</p>
      <p>The letters of September 11 and 13, 1862, describe his
         being wounded and captured during the Seven Days Battle around
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>, and of his regret of not being
         able to be with the Army during its invasion of 
         <geogname>Maryland</geogname>. The letters of October and
         November describe the Army's situation as it camped at 
         <geogname>Winchester, Virginia</geogname>.</p>
      <p>The letters of December, 1862, describe the 
         <geogname>Fredericksburg</geogname>campaign. He describes the
         battle in detail, as he had an opportunity to observe it first
         hand from high ground. Also interesting is the letter of
         December 20, 1862, as he describes the interaction of Union
         and Confederate soldiers after the battle.</p>
      <p>The letters of May 29 through July 15, 1863, describe the
         preparations for and the aftermath of the 
         <geogname>Gettysburg</geogname>campaign. The letters before
         the battle talk of the great strength and confidence of the
         army as it marched northward. The letter of July 8 describes
         the battle and its aftermath. Of particular interest is the
         description of the decimation of General 
         <persname>[George Edward] Pickett</persname>'s division, of
         which he is a member. The letters of August 1863 begin to
         describe the increased interest of the troops in religious
         activities. He also talks of his efforts to help increase this
         interest. The letter of September 10, 1863 ends the year's
         correspondence as he states that General 
         <persname>James Longstreet</persname>'s Corps would be going
         to 
         <geogname>Chattanooga, Tennessee</geogname>, to reinforce
         General 
         <persname>Braxton Bragg</persname>. General Pickett's Division
         was a part of this Corps.</p>
      <p>Letters of March 21 through April 30, 1864 describe the
         army's limited action and increase of religious activity. The
         letter of May 6 describes the Battle of the 
         <geogname>Wilderness</geogname>, and the letters of May 13 and
         16 describe the Battle of 
         <geogname>Spotsylvania</geogname>and its aftermath.</p>
      <p>The letters of June 24, 1864 through March 9, 1865, pertain
         to the Union siege of 
         <geogname>Petersburg, Virginia</geogname>. A letter of July 20
         expresses his disappointment at the failure of 
         <persname>Jubal Early</persname>'s attempt at capturing 
         <geogname>Washington D.C.</geogname>He is also worried over
         the replacement of General 
         <persname>Joseph E. Johnston</persname>with General 
         <persname>John Bell Hood</persname>in the defense of 
         <geogname>Atlanta</geogname>. The letter of January 10, 1865,
         talks of the daily rise in prices of articles, and the
         corresponding despondence of the people. He also talks of the
         House of Delegates' refusal of peace resolutions.</p>
      <p>The letters of January through April 1865 speak of the
         scarcity of food and fuel experienced by the men in 
         <geogname>Petersburg</geogname>. The letters of February 24
         and 27 describe the situation in 
         <geogname>Petersburg</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>a month before the cities are
         abandoned.</p>
      <p>The last letters of the war speak of the great need of
         food. There is no description of the Army of Northern
         Virginia's last stand, or surrender, at Appomattox,
         Virginia.</p>
      <p>The eight letters of 1866, 1868, 1876, and 1878 describe
         the different Conferences of the 
         <corpname>Methodist Episcopal Church</corpname>that Granbery
         attended during these years. There are also eleven letters
         written from his wife Ella to him during the Civil War. These
         pertain only to life at home without her husband and the
         problems of raising children during a war.</p>
