               <p>Personal correspondence of Elizabeth Blackwell and

               mention of slaves such as a letter of June 22, n.y.,
               from Octavia mentioning that a slave tried to get away
               in Cincinnati as they were going to Missouri, and a
               letter of June 30, n.y., from Sarah T. Buckner who wants
               to collect on a loan so that she can buy a slave's
               husband and send them both west. Letters from the family
               members who moved to Missouri provide insights into the
               emotional and physical hardships involved in such
               immigration.

               <p>Elizabeth C. Blaetterman of Maysville, Kentucky, to
               "Victoria" in Virginia. Comments on how both male and
               female are teaching these days just for their board.
               Writes primarily of her freed servants (slaves) and how
               they are doing in their lives. Evidently, Mr.
               Blaetterman would purchase a slave with the intent of
               setting the slave free, but the freed slave would pay
               back Mr. Blaetterman his purchase price. It seems Mr.
               Blaetterman did this to keep slave families together.
               She regrets not doing more.

               <p>Miscellaneous collection concerning the above
               families of Albemarle County and Richmond, Virginia. Of
               interest is a set of letters to Mildred Perkins from her
               cousins in Bolton, Mississippi after the Civil War.
               Evidently the families had never met and were trying to
               establish contact after the War. One letter of
               particular note, Virginia McKay, January 2, 1870, writes
               "the last sensation was a female lecturer from the
               North, one of the strong minded, I suppose, she looked
               very masculine, her subject was phrenology, which she
               could not possible do justice to....we went through
               curiosity and are fully convinced that speaking public
               is not a woman's prerogative." (2317-d). Also of
               interest is a broadside for a "Grand Military Ball" to
               be held at Camp Carondelet, February 25, 1862, and a
               packet of letters to Mildred Perkins about love,
               marriage and life among young people before the Civil
               War (2317-e)

               who is attending the Virginia Female Institute, writes

               <p>Civil War letters to Richard B. Buck of the Warren
               Rifles, Virginia 17th Regiment, from various family
               members and friends. His mother Jane Buck writes to him,
               May 13, 1861, praying for any early end to the war and
               that no blood will be shed, but if so "that the calamity
               fall upon the heads of our enemy." In a letter, May 21,
               1861, she wishes he would spend some time with the
               ladies," I do not like your being so long from under the
               influence of ladies society." Jane Buck's early letters
               clearly express her concern about her son's morals and
               the effect war and "bad company" may have on him. She
               writes to remember his God and prayers. However, as the
               war drags on, her letters change tone, but she always
               encourages her son to invoke the protection of God.
               Other items of interest are the letters of his cousins,
               Nell and Lucy Buck (of the above diary). Lucy's are very
               serious from the beginning, but Nell's are
               light-hearted, but as with Jany Buck's letters, her
               correspondence also grows more somber as the war
               progressed. These letters seem to reflect the mood of
               the South at the beginning of the War, that all this was
               going to be a great and heroic adventure, until it was
               obvious the war wasn't going to be over in a month.

               <p>Papers of the Cabell and Carrington families of
               Albemarle and Buckingham counties and Richmond. The
               letters of Agnes Gamble Cabell to her stepdaughter
               Louisa Cabell (later Carrington) are a rich source of
               ante- bellum family life. They provide insight into the
               life of a well-to-do young woman's life in early 19th
               century Virginia. Correspondence spans 1817-1862 and
               touches upon education, health and medicine, slave life,
               politics, gossip, mother and daughter relations,
               child-rearing and romance. One letter dated February 28,
               1819, warns Louisa that one of her beaux is part Indian
               (Not Native-American) and she will have to pass him by
               as well as his cousin. However, Agnes also warns her
               daughter not to be too picky because "not, I would have
               you all to understand, that I am in a hurry to have you
               married, but, married you must be some time or other, as
               the world goes." Also a comment on Thomas Jefferson's
               grandson, Thomas Randolph, being stabbed severely by his
               brother-in-law, Bankhead," a worthless profligate
               fellow." Letters from 1819-1822 concentrate on Louisa's
               marriage and her child and also a mysterious illnesses
               that she succumbs to, which was called melancholia, but
               more likely post-partum depression. Her mother Agnes
               also gives birth during this time. Letter dated March 2,
               1822 Agnes to Louisa contains much advice concerning
               Louisa's baby and she is sending baby caps, "for myself,
               I trust I shall have no further use for them." A letter
               dated May 25, 1824, Agnes admonished Louisa for trying
               to nurse her own child as it will cause her injury.
               Agnes would have sent Easter (presumably a slave) to
               nurse the child if she had known, "but we permitted her
               to dry up her milk." In November of 1825, Louisa gave
               birth to a girl after two sons, Agnes writes: "Will Paul
               and William be cast off for this little Miss?-not
               entirely-but I think you will perceive a difference in
               the kind of affection you will feel for your little
               girl-though not in the degree, you will love them all
               equally, but she will have more of your tenderness.
               (November 2, 1825)." A very strong collection. Related
               materials, the letters of Laura Wirt to Louisa
               Carrington, are in 2546.

               <p>Papers of various members of the Cabell family,
               chiefly the papers of Joseph Carrington Cabell
               (1778-1856), a member of the Virginia legislature for
               thirty years, one of the founders of the University of
               Virginia and a member of its first Board of Visitors.
               Includes much correspondence of women touching on such
               subjects as daily life, religion, education and
               medicine. Highlights are the letters Joseph Carrington
               Cabell wrote to St. George Tucker requesting the hand of
               his step-daughter, Mary (Polly) Walker Carter in
               marriage. These letters provide a valuable insight into
               Virginia eighteenth century courtship among the
               plantation class. Also of interest are several letters
               from both Mrs. Ann Cowper and her husband, William
               Cowper to Joseph C. Cabell about the disintegration of
               their marriage, and Mrs. Cowper's request for divorce in
               1812. There is also information on the detaining of a
               Parsons Taylor, a fencing instructor at the Richmond
               Academy, for seducing six female students.

               <p>Correspondence, diaries, and other papers of Mary
               Virginia Ellet Cabell, her father, Charles Ellet, Jr.,
               civil engineer, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and her
               husband William D. Cabell of Norwood, Nelson County,
               Virginia, relating primarily to Mrs. Cabell's career as
               author and civic leader. Collection includes a thousand
               letters from Mrs. Cabell to her children, material on
               Norwood school, data on the Daughters of the American
               Revolution. Mary Ellet was William Daniel Cabell's
               second wife, and the letters he wrote to her during
               their courtship are very passionate in nature. Mary,
               however, is practical in her responses, perhaps because
               she had responsibility for her younger siblings, Willie
               and Nina, and marriage was not on her mind. The letters
               between husband and wife reflect the structure of a 19th
               century marriage, however, Mary Cabell comes across
               strongly as an independent thinker and her husband very
               reliant on her. Correspondence touches on almost every
               issue from literature to politics.

               Miles Cary (1806-1877) of Charlottesville, Virginia, and
               later of Maryland, and that of Archibald Cary
               (1815-1854), of Cumberland County, Maryland. Highlights
               include letters between Jane Margaret Carr Cary (Mrs.
               Wilson Miles Cary) and her mother, Hetty Carr
               (1829-1832), and between Jane Margaret and her cousin
               Dabney Carr Terrell, who traveled extensively in
               Kentucky and who describes a reception for Lafayette.
               Also of interest are the Civil War letters. Jennie and
               Hetty, daughters of W.M.C. and Constance, daughter of
               Archibald Cary, frequently crossed into Confederate
               territory, and detailed these crossings in letters. Some
               of the correspondence relates to the house searches to
               which the Carys were subject as Southern sympathizers.

               <p>The remarkable set of complete plantation records of
               John Hartwell Cocke of Bremo, Fluvanna County, Virginia.
               John Hartwell Cocke is less known than many of his
               contemporaries, but remains one of the most
               extraordinary men of his time. He co-founded the
               University of Virginia with Thomas Jefferson, waged war
               against the evils of alcohol, strongly supported
               education, and was an outspoken opponent to slavery, so
               much so that he educated his slaves and then set them
               free. Many returned to Africa and the ensuing
               correspondence between the former master and the free
               man makes for fascinating reading. There is also a rich
               amount of material regarding women's history, in
               particular 19th century plantation life. Of special
               interest are the diaries of Louisa Maxwell Homles Cocke,
               the second wife of General Cocke.

               <p>Personal correspondence of the family of Philip St.
               George Cocke. In her letter of February 9, 1846,
               Courtney Barraud of Norfolk, Virginia writes her cousin,
               John Bowdoin Cocke, that she has heard about "the big
               house" being begun and knows that "cousin Philip" will
               be very busy as "no one ever was more totally emersed in
               building." In an undated letter to her father, Philip
               St. George Cocke, Louisiana Barraud Cocke, is apparently
               defending Richard Byrd Kennon, whom she married on June
               21, 1860; she relates that she "asserted my pride &amp;
               dignity as a woman should" by speaking to Kennon about
               the conversation between him and her father, and that
               she is satisfied that he is sincere and that she has not
               been "the dupe of anybody."(2433-t)</p>
               <p>Also, letters to John Bowdoin Cocke (P. St. G.
               Cocke's son) from John H. Powell, principal of the
               Richmond Female Seminary concerning the progress and
               tuition fees of Cocke's three daughters (1886-1894),
               also correspondence of Sally Elizabeth Courtney Cocke to
               her husband P. St. G. Cocke.(2433-r).</p>
               <p>Of further interest are the letters of Courtney
               Bowdoin Cocke to various family members concerning
               family news, travels, activities and plantation matters
               (2433-q).</p>
               <p>Lastly, the letters dealing with the prolonged
               courtship, engagement, and eventual marriage of Bettie
               Burwell Page Cocke and John Bowdoin Cocke are of
               interest, as well as later letters which detail the
               effects the Civil War had on Southern land-owning
               families. (2433-l)

               <p>Papers of John Warwick Daniel (1842-1910), U. S.
               senator and Civil War Veteran, and his family. The
               earliest correspondence, 1816-1825, is between Judge
               William Daniel (1771-1839), his wife Margaret Baldwin)
               Daniel (d. 1824), and their children, of Lynchburg,
               Virginia. The letters contain news of family and
               friends, advice on manners and education to children,
               and mention of medical treatments. These papers are an
               excellent source for the study of family life and
               women's role in the early 19th century. Also of
               importance are the letters Sarah Warwick Daniel between
               William Daniel, Jr.

               Virginia, containing land and property sales, bankruptcy
               petitions, wills and letters. In October 1864, Maggie
               Douglas writes from Dayton, Virginia, to her mother and
               brother in Greene County, Virginia, concerning the
               looting and burning of her home by the Union army.
               Families for miles around have had their property
               destroyed. After the war, the Douglas family suffered
               increased financial difficulties and in December of
               1873, John Douglas files for bankruptcy. Maggie moves to
               Georgia soon after the Civil War. Life does not get much
               better as much as their property is again destroyed by
               fire and her husband suffers a nervous breakdown.

               Several Civil War letters deal with the Peninsula
               Campaign and the California Gold Rush. There are some
               letters (1850) from a young lady attending an
               unidentified girls school (possibly Piedmont) writing
               about her music program and a letter dated November 20,
               1858 from Betsy Brock to her cousin Mary telling her of
               how "Julia Ann" (possibly a slave?)was taken from them
               by a Mr. Burton with the knowledge of Betsy's mother.
               Other female correspondence is scattered throughout the

               concerning Mrs. Evans' experiences in Mexico during the
               Agrarian Revolution. Correspondence concerns settlements
               of her estate and publication of her letters. Additional
               papers are in regards to the settlement of Mrs. Evans'
               Mexican estate, including Mexican and United States
               legal documents, maps, and correspondence. Daisy Caden
               Pettus and her attorneys attempted to gain compensation
               for Mrs. Evans' lands which were seized by the Agrarians
               after they murdered Mrs. Evans. See Claude Philippe

               purportedly lived with or possibly married a Black woman
               (by whom he had children) after his wife, Jane Taylor
               Garland, left him at the beginning of the War. Documents
               to substantiate this story include a letter, March 11,
               1861, from Jane Garland to "Mr. Garland" requesting
               support; and letters to "Mother or Mama" in the 1870's
               and 1890's (when Jane Taylor Garland would be dead or at
               the least past child bearing age). A collection which
               deserves more attention.

               <p>Papers of the James Mercer Garnett family of
               Baltimore, Virginia. The elder Garnett was a professor
               at the University of Virginia from 1882-1896, his son
               was secretary of the Maryland chapter of the University
               of Virginia Alumni Association, and his wife active in
               the Daughters of the Confederacy, a predecessor of the
               United Daughters of the Confederacy. Mrs. Garnett seems
               to have been an important officer in this organization
               and her records are fairly complete. There are also
               short sketches written by Mrs. Garnett of missionary
               work done by a Baltimore Church in the Far East.

               appears frequently in accounts and correspondence during
               the 1850's and 1860's. However, there is little material
               concerning the Civil War. There is also material
               pertaining to Rosa Boisseau, a cousin of the Gilliams,
               about whom little is known. The primary interest of this

               was a schoolgirl in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and at
               home in Wythe County, Virginia. The diary gives a
               telling account of the girl's daily life in
               Philadelphia, but its primary value lies in the fat that
               it reveals how ine girl's thoughts and feelings were
               affected by the outbreak of the Civil War. Accompanying

               <p>Papers of William H. Laird of Charlottesville,
               Virginia, consisting of correspondence among Laird and
               family members when he was serving as chaplain for the
               8th Evacuation Hospital in Europe. Also included are
               photographs, diaries, and maps. Bulk of the
               correspondence is between Laird and his wife, Constance
               and their children. Topics discussed include Arab women
               (May 23, 1843), the argument over the necessity of
               nurses in the unit (June 8, 1943), and the promotion of
               nurses (August 15, 1943). Letters from home provide
               insight into the effects of the second World War upon
               family members left behind.

               <p>A collection of items pertaining to the
               Latan&#233; family of Essex County, Virginia.
               Included are correspondence, business and legal papers,
               papers in regards to military and religious matters,
               school notebooks, and certificates of graduation for
               schools of the University of Virginia. The early
               eighteenth century correspondence contains many letters
               from Henry Latan&#233; and his wife, Anne, London,
               England, to his brother, Lewis and his third wife, Mary
               (Deane), South Farnham Parish, Essex County. After her
               husband's death in 1732, Mary (Deane) Latane managed the
               property that came to her and her children, with the
               help of her cousin, William Beverley. There are several
               letters, 1733-1750, from Beverley discussing the
               settlement of her husband's estate and the sale of her
               tobacco.

               <p>Interesting set of unrelated letters including a
               letter, October 30, 1859, from M. L. Moore to "Dear
               Sally Ann" discussing deaths in the family, with an
               interesting note about a lady preacher, in a letter,
               March 3, 1861. M. Taliafera to "Dear Sister," vehemently
               denies she will marry a man named Binks. There are two
               very interesting letters written by a former slave to
               her mistress. In the letter dated March 31, 1871, she
               relates her life to her former mistress, she is not
               well, misses everyone and inquires of how her mistress
               is doing. The second letter is a very revealing letter
               on several accounts. Her husband has left her to marry
               another woman: "[He] married a woman with two children,
               nearly white. I never did anything to make him leave
               me...He swore to every one that he was not married to
               me, but he just staid with me I am nearly crazy...if you
               have my license I would like for you to send me it, so I
               can prove we are married...Henry (the man in question)
               has not a friend in the community, black or white, every
               one said it was the best thing that I ...of such a
               trifling darkey."

               desire to come stay near him at a Washington College (in

               <p>Nellie Newman, evidently the belle of the Isle of
               Wight, Virginia, received many love letters from
               different men. But it appeared that her heart belonged
               to George Neville. At first their relationship was
               jovial, with her teasing him about other women, but with
               the coming of the War, their relationship took a serious
               turn, and toward the end of the War, Christmas 1864,
               they were married. The letters are from George to
               Nellie. This is a first-rate collection in regards to
               the Civil War and how it affected men and women.
               Evidently George Neville was a high-ranking clerk and
               his letters are full of information regarding the War
               around Richmond, especially the last desperate days.
               Some highlights of the collection include a letter,
               January 28, 1858, from Nellie's cousin, A. F. Culpepper
               to Nellie, discussing his latest child and blaming women
               for so many children. A "contract," April 5, 1859,
               between George Neville and Nellie Newman, since she lost
               a bet and could not come up with $500,000, she "herein
               resign, give, and yield myself unto the said George S.
               Neville, to have, hold, use and enjoy my body, as may
               best suit his pleasure." A letter dated August 19, 1859,
               from Hannah to Nellie, describes teaching and her social
               life. A letter, February 8, 1864, George to Nellie,
               describes a lady acquaintance who had married a Yankee
               because at the age of 28 she was tired of waiting. A
               letter dated October 20, 1864, George to Nellie,
               indicates that they are sending every man possible to
               the army, and that the men in his office do not know
               what will happen with them. A letter containing a call
               by top Confederate officials to give arms to "negroes"
               and have them in the army.

               "young ladies learn early that a woman's strength is,
               first, her spotless chasity." Dr. Plummer advocated that
               women should be taught to spell before anything else and
               not to read too many novels as young ladies begin to
               identify with the heroine.

               <p>Personal correspondence and business papers of the
               Randolph, Page, and Taylor families (descendants of
               Thomas Jefferson) of Albemarle County, Virginia,
               including many of the papers of Thomas Jefferson
               Randolph. Included is a letter of January 11, 1827, from
               a P. Leubal to [Thomas Jefferson Randolph] mentioning
               that the slave he recently bought from him [Randolph]
               named Jeanette had been severely burned by the overseer
               and thrown into a fire twice and that he could not
               return her because she feared for her life but that he
               believed her value is much less than the sale price.

               <p>The papers of Thomas L. Rosser, Confederate Brigadier
               General, and chief engineer of the Northern Pacific
               Railroad. The papers fall into four distinct sets. The
               first collection (1171, -a, -b), 1860-1950, contains
               material regarding his wife Elizabeth (Betty) Winston
               Rosser, whom Rosser met and married during the Civil
               War, including correspondence (1875-1917), poetry, and a
               scrapbook she kept during the Civil War. Also included
               in the collection is the correspondence of the Rossers'
               granddaughter, Barbara Rosser. The second collection
               (1171-c), 1764 (1834-1910) 1969, concerns both the
               Gordon and Rosser families. The pre-Civil War
               correspondence between the Gordon sisters is not
               extensive, but provides a view of nineteenth century
               domestic life, as well as home manufacturing activities.
               Also included in this set of papers are more letters
               between Elizabeth (Betty) Winston Rosser and her
               husband. Topics include discussions of their upcoming
               wedding (April and May 1863), and denials of being
               involved and perhaps having been married to another
               woman (mid-summer 1863), and his promises that he will
               give up drinking. Also of interest is a letter from
               Elizabeth Custer to Mrs. Rosser regarding her
               involvement in a girls' club in New York City, Barbara
               Winston's will (1764), and some correspondence of
               Barbara Rosser. The third set of papers (1171, -d, -e,
               -f), 1858-1918, includes family correspondence. The last

               <p>Papers of Landon Carter of the Tidewater area of
               Virginia and the son of Robert "King" Carter. Collection
               is strong in 18th century material. However, most of the
               correspondence generated by women is nineteenth century.
               There are several colorful letters concerning women from
               the 18th century. Highlights are letters from Charles
               Carter to Landon Carter: April 26, 1758, writes that he
               found a woman 24 years old whom he planned to marry to
               take the place of his deceased wife; January 4, 1763,
               surprised that L. C.'s daughter Marie is to marry Robert
               Beverly, doubts his qualities and reports he frequently
               needs money and nearly killed a man in a duel; 1763,
               announces that his daughter, Judith, "by her own
               unalterable determination married Tuesday last." Rev.
               Isaac W. Giberne to Landon Carter, January 6, 1768,
               apologizes for his wife's bad manners for not accepting
               an invitation to Sabine Hall; Rev. Isaac Giberne writes
               of his wife's elopement and "who I am credibly informed,
               keeps company very night with some strolling players."
               Ralph Wormeley Carter to Landon Carter, May 10, 1774,
               reports that William Jackson, overseer at "Rippon" had
               pursued a wench who had failed his instructions," upon
               which he turned up her clothes and whipped her breach; I
               checked him for his mode of correction and made the
               matter up between them." Rev. Isaac W. Giberne to Landon
               Carter, attempts to have Carter repent his sworn enmity
               for Reuben Beale who had eloped with his daughter,
               Judith. The marriage proved to be a very happy one, but
               Carter never forgave the young man for his actions.

               <p>Letters to Daniel Scanland of Middleburg, Loudoun
               County, Virginia, from members of his family in Walnut
               Dale, Pike County, Missouri concerning departures of
               California wagon trains, northern raids, and the
               hardships of non-combatants in the Civil War and life in
               general. Most of the letters are from his cousin Nancy
               Scanland written during 1851, recounting her life and
               activities. Nancy, a bit of a flirt, confides many of
               her feelings to her cousin Daniel and many of them
               concern romance. Highlights include a letter from
               Daniel's cousin, S. H. [Barnard] to Daniel dated
               September 18, 1852, concerning all the pretty unmarried
               girls to choose from in Missouri; November 23, 1851,
               Nancy writes Daniel to tell of her upcoming marriage and
               she laments the fact she will be separated from her
               family. From this letter and many others, one gets the
               idea that courtship was swift and sure on the frontier.
               There is only one letter to Daniel after her marriage to
               a Mr. Charles Benning.

               describing life at that time. Maynard furnished a very
               vivid description of German air raids over Great Britain
               and mentions several other aspects of life during
               wartime such as the morale of the British during the
               "blitz raids," the collapse of France, American air aid
               relief, difficulty of communication with other parts of
               Great Britain, rationing "tough drunks," living in
               public air raid shelters, and the Germany-Italy-Japan
               Axis Alliance.

               <p>Legal correspondence of Robert Stanard (1781-1846) of
               Fredericksburg, Spotsylvania County and Richmond,
               Virginia. His practice was largely concerned with civil
               suits involving wills, administration of estates, and
               land matters. There are numerous references to women who
               seek his help as well as references to slaves.

               the latter half of the 19th century, businesses included
               Borderland Coal Company and Stone Printing in Roanoke,
               Virginia. While most of the papers are business in
               nature there is some personal correspondence with
               several friends, many women. Also of interest is
               correspondence between committee members concerning the
               establishment of a Liberal Arts College for Women. There
               is correspondence with daughter Mary at her exclusive

               <p>Papers pertaining to the career of Alexander Hugh
               Holmes Stuart (1807-1891), former Secretary of the
               Interior. In a cryptic letter, July 1791, from Cornelius
               Baldwin to his newly-married sister, Mrs. Archibald
               (Betsy) Stuart, he warns her of female malice. Stuart
               writes his mother, Eleanor Stuart, November 19,
               1820-1825, about school life in Williamsburg, Virginia,
               and living in luxury. He has made several acquaintances,
               "Particularly amongst the Ladies...[they] are
               fascinating in their manners...they seem to possess a
               certain magical influence over you which makes you
               forget everything else..." Letters from Stuart to his
               mother during the period of 1850-1853 describes all the
               social functions he and his wife Fanny are attending in
               Washington, D.C. In one letter he describes Fanny's new
               wardrobe in some detail. Another letter of interest,
               August 18, 1851, is from Susan C. Armstrong, a widowed
               cousin of Stuart, who implores him for a post in his
               office, as she has three children to feed and no means
               left to her.

               The suit was over counter claims on a female slave. Also

               attentions to a certain young lady as "ladies in general

               <p>Assorted correspondence of members of these families
               of Albemarle and Goochland counties, Virginia. Of
               interest are the letters of Deborah Logan, of
               Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to her niece, Deborah Norris
               Woodson, Goochland County, Virginia. Of interest are the
               letters of Deborah Logan, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
               to her niece, Deborah Norris Woodson, Goochland County,
               Virginia. In a letter dated July 2, 1829, D. L. writes
               D. N. W., "for the concentration of great and sensible
               men...from Virginia, have given a very general idea of
               the genius of her sons, how can we suppose in her care
               alone, that nature is the same letter she speaks of
               Fanny who is stricken with a "palsey" in a new town
               "Where she is unknown and so many of her colour are very
               wretched." A letter from D.L. to D.N.W., January 18,
               1829, encourages her to read "useful and sensible books,
               not exclusively novels," and agreeable one's now adorn
               literature of the day, both in Europe and America."
               Later she mentioned Fanny again who is now in
               Philadelphia," the misery of the coloured population is
               so great in the suburb of the city...to make any kind
               heart regret they are no longer under the protection of
               those more competent...yet I am an enemy of slavery and
               should be very glad if it did not exist among us." In
               letters dated 1829-1830, D.L. writes of Mrs. Madison,
               Mrs. Monroe, and Martha Jefferson Randolph, of a cholera
               epidemic in Philadelphia, the Nat Turner revolt and her
               concern about the South and slavery. On a more personal
               level she stresses education and reading for women and
               her views on politics. The former slave Fanny is visited
               by her son who is doing quite well in Haiti. She also
               mentions in a letter dated March 12, she writes of a
               terrible thunderstorm the tragedy which resulted," a
               poor young woman at a factory a few miles from us...she
               was sitting at her loom near the end of the building
               which was struck by lightening, a large iron bolt of the
               machinery was just above her from whence attracted by
               the steel in her corset bosom it instantly killed and
               tore her poor body with frightful violence." Letters
               dated 1833-1835 from D. L. to D. N. W. concern the South
               and Nullification, John Randolph of Roanoke, vehemently
               opposes Martin Van Buren and other leaders. On a more
               intimate level she writes of a woman eloping and
               marrying beneath her station, she had clandestine
               meetings with the man, she writes often of her friend
               Sarah Walker whose husband or father is a tyrant, and in
               a letter dated June 3, 1933, D. L. writes "good
               housewifery is a very important part of the character of
               a woman." A very strong set of letters from an
               opinionated woman.

               Glasgow, DuBose and Dorothy Heyward, and Walter de la
               Mare to University of Virginia English Professor James
               Southall Wilson (1880-1963) and wife Julia. The letters
               from James Branch Cabell (1879-1958) and his wife
               Margaret congratulate Wilson and discuss personal and
               literary matters. A single letter of Willa Cather
               (1873-1947) to Mr. [Stringfellow] Barr responds
               negatively to an invitation to lecture at the University
               of Virginia due to unsettled family conditions, although
               she says that "I always feel very deeply that I am a
               Virginian" (December 5, 1928). Ellen Glasgow also
               discusses literary and personal news. Dorothy Heyward
               speaks of going to the Huntington Hartford Foundation
               for writers in order to finish a book begun in summer
               (January 14, 1960).

               Wilson (see Minor-Wilson papers), Susan was born in
               Pennsylvania and attended private schools in Virginia.
               She was trained in occupational therapy work in New York
               and from 1918-1919 served as a reconstruction aide in
               France and the U.S. In 1924, she became the Chief
               Occupational Therapist at the Brooklyn State Hospital.
               In the early forties she was a lecturer on occupational
               therapy at NYU and soon became an occupational therapy
               officer at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Seattle,
               Washington. The events in her life are well documented
               in letters, particularly to her mother, and numerous
               photographs. Also included is correspondence of her
               siblings, and parents. A strong collection for 19th

               <p>A 300-page volume containing typescript letters from
               Laura H. Wirt, daughter of William Wirt, Attorney
               General of the United States, to Louisa Cabell
               Carrington, Laura Wirt's mother, Elizabeth Wirt, was the
               sister of Louisa Cabell Carrington's step-mother, Agnes
               S. B. Gamble Cabell. Louisa married Henry Carrington in
               1820, bore eight children and died January 8, 1865.
               Laura Wirt married Thomas Randall in 1827, bore four
               daughters and died in Florida in 1834. They shared
               confidences and gossip. Laura's letters are sparkling
               and witty and touch upon all the current events, music,
               literature, health, romance, and family. Her letters are
               extremely frank in nature. For example in writing to
               Louisa after her marriage and after her move to Florida,
               she writes "it requires some time, however, for a
               nouvelle mariee to learn to be happy under the change of
               circumstances...I never was less happy in my life than
               the two first two months of my marriage...I love him
               [Thomas Randall, her husband] very much, Louisa. Even
               more than when he was my lover...a lover is more
               charming than a husband, but not so dear. No doubt it is
               the same case with us women, and perhaps we gain as much
               as we lose by the exchange" (March 6, 1828). A strong
               collection which reflects relationships which women had
               with each other.

               Anne Jones Withrow of Waynesboro, Virginia, from their

               Evelyn married Matthew Hale Houston, a Presbyterian
               missionary to China, in 1871. Letters concerning the
               Houstons' stay at the Presbyterian Mission Church in
               Hangchow include the following: January 4, August 11,
               and September 6, 1881; March 22, August 5 &amp; 12,
               September 13, October 3 &amp; 16, and November 18, 1882.
               Louisa and her brother Charles, a graduate of the
               University of Virginia, were both educators, and their
               correspondence at times discusses their work.

               <p>W. H. Wright wrote under the pen name, S. S. Van
               Dine, and created the detective character, Philo Vance.
               Most of the collection consists of correspondence
               between Wright, and his wife, Katherine Boynton Wright,
               and their daughter Beverley. Due to his work and their
               fragile health, mental and physical, the Wrights spent
               most of their 23-year marriage apart. They eventually
               divorced in 1930. These letters reflect a troubled
               marriage and a dysfunctional family. Toward the end of
               their marriage and Wright's life, letters between him
               and Katherine primarily concerned money disputes and the
               life of their wayward daughter, Beverley, who led a
               bohemian lifestyle. Correspondence, 1928, strongly
               indicates Beverley had lesbian tendencies which upset
               her mother, but not her father.

               <p>papers of the Ellis and Munford families of Richmond,
               Virginia, and of the Young family of Fredericksburg,
               Virginia. There are documents relating to Rosetta
               Hunter, a slave, who was bought by Charles Ellis in
               February, 1839. She commanded the price of $850 and was
               held in high esteem by the family and eventually became
               the beloved "Mammy." Documents include her bill of sale
               and matters relating to her estate as well as her
               obituary. There is a document, January 27, 1840,
               releasing fourteen year old Lucy Ann Hunter, a "bright
               mulatto" from slavery. Other items of interest are
               Margaret Ellis' letters to her son Powhatan Ellis during
               the Civil War, a touching letter from Charles Ellis to
               his sister Jane Eubank (August 16, 1851) congratulating
               her on her recent marriage, a letter from Sallie Munford
               to her Uncle Powhie describing her activities as young
               woman (January 12, 1860), and the letters from Charles
               Ellis Munford while a student at the University of
               Virginia to his sister Sallie Munford (1860) are
               particularly enjoyable. Unfortunately, Charles was
               killed in 1862 during the Battle of Malvern Hill.
