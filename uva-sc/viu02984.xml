      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection contains ca. 400 items, 1937-1958,
         concerning Charlton Gilmore Holland, who was a graduate
         medical student in Vienna, Austria, 1937, and in the U.S. Army
         Medical Corps as a psychiatrist during World War II. In
         addition, he served as president of the Archaeological Society
         of Virginia and researched and wrote on pre-Columbian Indian
         pottery in Virginia. The collection contains correspondence of
         Holland with associates, friends, and family, and photographs
         and printed material.</p>
      <p>Holland's letters home from Germany and Austria, 1937,
         describe his bicycle tour through Germany, Freiburg im
         Breisau, the Nuremberg Rally, a speech by Alfred Rosenberg,
         Vienna, and his medical studies at the University of
         Vienna.</p>
      <p>The letters to Holland are primarily a series from Clifford
         Evans, Associate Curator, and Betty J. Meggers, Research
         Associate, of the Division of Archaeology at the Smithsonian
         Institution in Washington, D.C. during the 1950's. Topics
         discussed include the opening of the Latin American Hall of
         the United States National Museum on Pan American Day, April
         14, 1954; a manuscript on which they were collaborating during
         1953; Evans' and Meggers' trip to Ecuador during 1955
         (November 2, 1955) and plans for a trip in 1956 (June 19 &amp;
         26, September 13, 1956); and their archeological finds on the
         Rio Napo, Ecuador (December 20, 1956). Holland, as an
         archaeologist, was informed by the Smithsonian Institution of
         various archaeological artifacts that the museum received and
         other important information about the field of archaeology in
         general. There are also letters (November 28, December 4 &amp;
         11, 1956; January 2, 1957) from Douglas S. Byers, Director of
         the Robert S. Peabody Foundation for Archeology, discussing
         Holland's manuscript, "Preceramic and Ceramic Culture Patterns
         in Northwest Virginia" [in #2876].</p>
      <p>The photographs include a picture of a Thanksgiving Dinner,
         1937, sponsored by the American Medical Association in Vienna.
         The printed material consists of German maps, guides to the
         city of Vienna and an invitation to the Thanksgiving Dinner
         that was sponsored by the American Medical Association of
         Vienna.</p>
