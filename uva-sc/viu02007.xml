      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of three newsclippings concerning
         Julien Green and his novels, 1931-1933, and two letters from
         Edward Green, Paris, to his sister Mary, Mrs. Ten Eyck DeWitt,
         Veeder, one of which discusses Julien Green's latest book and
         his reception in the literary world.</p>
      <p>In the first letter, January 9, 1924, Edward Green writes
         to his sister Mary concerning the death of her husband, refers
         to his memories of the deathbed scenes of some Confederate
         soldiers on "the Lawn" (Prince William County, Virginia)
         during the Civil War, and mentions that the disturbed state of
         Europe is affecting his business.</p>
      <p>Edward Green's second letter, May 14, 1927, mentions the
         illness of their sister Anne at Savannah, the death of their
         sister Belle, and the welfare of several family members and
         friends as well as himself. About Julien Green's latest book,
         [ 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Adrienne Mesurat</title>?] he writes,
         "Julien's last novel has no doubt been a great success and the
         book is not only selling well but he is receiving many
         compliments from authors and literary critics..." He also
         refers to a long article about Julien in a paper published in
         Geneva, Switzerland, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">La Semaine Litteraire</title>, which
         says that "he is willing to bet that Julien never in his
         existence ever met or knew any such creatures as the heroines
         of his novels. I quite agree with the said writer - but it is
         the extraordinary mentality of Julien's heroines that makes
         his books a success as he seems to have invented characters
         which no one ever thought of...". Edward Green goes on to
         mention the distress of the French public over the
         disappearance of the aviators [Nungesser ?] and Coli, who had
         attempted to fly to New York a week ago and a visit from an
         old French Colonel formerly a member of the French Foreign
         Legion who was president of the local committee of the Sisters
         of St. Vincent de Paul, a Catholic humanitarian
         organization.</p>
