      <p>Atcheson Laughlin Hench (1891-1974), Linden Kent Memorial Professor Emeritus
                of English at the University of Virginia, was born in Orange, New Jersey, and grew
                up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, attending college at Lafayette College in Easton,
                Pennsylvania, in 1912. He received both his Master's (1917) and Doctorate (1921)
                degrees from Harvard University, before he began his teaching career as an associate
                professor at the University of Virginia in 1922. Hench was to remain at the
                University for forty years, becoming a full professor in 1925 and the Linden Kent
                Memorial Professor in 1940. Also in 1925, he married Virginia Bedinger Michie (d.
                1971), and they had two daughters, Margaret Hench Underwood and Clare Showalter
                Hench.</p>
      <p>Dr. Hench was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa and the Raven Society, and received the
                Algernon Sydney award I 1966. He was well-known for his work as a consultant in
                compiling dictionaries, contributing to the Oxford English Dictionary, and served as
                a frequent contributor and editor of <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">American Speech</title>.
                He also served as a visiting professor at the New York University and a Fulbright
                Lecturer at the University of Innsbruck, Austria. His interest in local history and
                public affairs was reflected in his presence on the Charlottesville School Board and
                his contributions to the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Magazine of Albemarle County
                    History</title>. Hench was well-known for his varied and wide interests and
                everyone who knew him seems to have their own favorite Hench stories.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Atcheson L. Hench Autograph Collection consists of material collected by Hench,
                ca. 870 items (12 Hollinger boxes, 5 linear feet), from the mid 9th century to the 20th
                century, some for an autograph collection and others for use in his classes at the
                University of Virginia with examples of various periods.</p>
      <p>The collection includes material reflecting his interest in Old English, Middle
                English and Elizabethan script; letters by associates of Edgar Allan Poe; Civil War
                letters; papers relating to Virginia history; correspondence of writers, poets,
                politicians, and other correspondence, including both American and English literary
                and historical material. People with significant amounts of material associated with
                their name include George Cary Eggleston, Paul Hamilton Hayne, William Ernest
                Henley, William Cabell Rives, and Edmund Clarence Stedman.</p>
      <p>Many of the descriptions of items in Box 1 benefited from the expertise and notes of
                Consuelo Dutschke who examined these documents in 2007.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement>
      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>This collection is arranged in two series: Series I: Medieval and Early European
                Manuscripts (Boxes 1-6) and Series II: Collection of Modern Autographs (Boxes 7-12).
                Longer runs of correspondence (like Paul Hamilton Hayne) are arranged as usual under
                the name of the writer, then alphabetically by name of the recipient, with the
                letters to unidentified recipients or simple autographs arranged chronologically
                after the identified ones.</p>

                                while discussing his own work, Hayne informs Stoddard that the poems
                                that he likes the most in his book <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The

                                "the chief narrative piece was composed in a very unlucky vein; and
                                I <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="underline" xlink:href="">bitterly</title> regret its publication.
                                Indeed my <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="altrender" xlink:href="">Legends &amp; Lyrics</title>
                                issued by <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="underline" xlink:href="">Lippincott</title> in 1972

                                poems I really value." He goes on to express his concern for his
                                friend's depression and despondency and writes at length with advice
                                to take care of his physical health, to avoid or forego the use of
                                stimulants, and to engage in some engrossing physical work. He also
                                asks for him to send <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">South Sea Idylls</title>
                                and not to worry about its condemnation in England, "I recollect
                                Byron's saying (true for once) that the English are often seized by
                                periodical fits of a <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="underline" xlink:href="">squeamish
                                    morality</title>." Hayne wants to know Stoddard's opinion of his
                                poem "Unveiled" published in Scribner's about which he says, "<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="underline" xlink:href="">Swinburne</title> also wrote me very kindly
                                and enthusiastically about <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="underline" xlink:href="">that</title>

                                informs the collector that he had placed the only one in his

                                liberty to sell it. Higginson says it is probably the only

                                England where he spoke to no great effect, "The nation, if I mistake
                                not is in better disposition toward us than her leaders. And where
                                are those leaders heading? I cannot help having great apprehensions.
                                Our government remains cool and composed."</unittitle>

                                masters; addresses Garrison's opinion that Southerners treated aged
                                ex-slaves kindly only out of a troubled conscience; expresses a
                                paternalistic attitude "The feeling of the better class of Southern
                                whites for the Negroes is much the feeling of older persons for
                                children, and our feeling toward the rising generation of Negroes is
                                much the same as that of older persons toward [pert?], disagreeable,
                                spoiled children"; he also tackles the topics of servant's wages,
                                rape of black or mulatto women, justice in the courtroom, and his
                                belief that Negroes are "members of a race without a past, with
                                little hope of a future, - a race dwelling on the very edge of the

                                with his opinion of the John Quincy Adams administration, "the
                                mischievous character of the present administration of our national
                                affairs, &amp; of the necessity of recovering them from the
                                unskillful and corrupt hands, which at present, control them." He
                                also believes that only Andrew Jackson has enough popularity with
                                the people to challenge the influence of Adams and Henry Clay and be
                                elected president, probably only for a single term. Rives agrees
                                with Thomas Jefferson's sentiment that a president should only serve
                                for a single term due to the immense power given the presidency by
                                the Constitution. He sends him a copy of his "reply to the

                                among the few to which one can turn again and again and again with
                                even new pleasure. The 'Farewell' is one of the sweetest bits of
                                writing that I know." Mrs. Bentley reports that Covent Garden is
                                beautiful and that the Kembles are doing wonders, with Charles being
                                rich at last. Macready is out of fashion and should have played in
