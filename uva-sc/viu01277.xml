      <p>This collection consists of three letters, all with their
         envelopes, 1862, from A.S. Davis, probably of the 1st
         Minnesota Regiment, Union Army, while serving in Virginia, to
         his brother, Charles Henry Davis, Little River, Maine, and his
         sister, Angie, Maine State Seminary, Lewiston, Maine, and
         Little River, Maine. The letter dated May 25, from Camp near
         Hole in the Ridge within some fourteen miles of Richmond, has
         a patriotic cover in blue and red with an eagle and flags. In
         this letters, Davis discusses the popularity of General George
         McClellan with his soldiers and officers, the bad roads and
         terrain of the area, his puzzlement over the plans of the
         secessionist army, their hopes of being in Richmond in a day
         or two, his supposition that the Southern army must be between
         the Chickahominy &amp; James Rivers, and reports from a Union
         sympathizer that the Confederate army is discouraged and sick
         of fighting.</p>
      <p>The second letter, July 27th, mentions the haying season in
         Maine and how he misses seeing the hay crop harvested eastern
         style, since the hay in Minnesota is principally made up of
         wild grasses growing in the meadows and marshy places,
         describes a review of the Sumner's Corps last Tuesday in which
         out of twenty-four regiments only the 19th Massachusetts
         Regiment and the 1st Minnesota Regiment were complimented in
         an order issued by General Edwin Vose Sumner (1797-1863)
         himself, and his visit to the 5th and 7th Maine Regiments. The
         last letter, August 1st, written from camp near Harrison's
         Landing, Charles City County, Virginia, describes an
         engagement with Confederate batteries from on the other side
         of the river opposite his camp who fired on the Union
         transports and troops killing six men before they were
         silenced.</p>
