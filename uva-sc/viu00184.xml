      <p> Robert Carter Randolph (1808-1887) was a
         physician, born at "Carter Hall" 
          Clarke County, Virginia, the son of 
          Archibald Cary (1769-1813) and 
          Lucy Burwell Randolph (1777-1810). Robert
         took the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 
          Philadelphia in 1828 and married 
          Lucy Nelson Wellford (1810-1882), daughter
         of 
          Susan R.C. Nelson (1790-1869) and 
          William Wellford, at "Chapel Hill" in 1830. 
          Robert C. Randolph and his family resided
         at "New Market" near 
          Millwood until the death of his wife when

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection contains ca. 415 items (1 Hollinger box),
         1825-1884, chiefly the correspondence of the 
          Randolph family of 
          Millwood, 
          Clarke County, Virginia. The
         correspondence largely consists of letters written to Dr. 
          Robert Carter Randolph (1808-1887) and 
          Lucy Nelson (Wellford)
         Randolph (1810-1882) by their children and other
         relatives. Printed material, receipts and miscellaneous items
         including recipes, invitations, poems, a diagram of a property
         lot, a speech, and a sermon make up the remainder of the
         collection.</p>
      <p>Because the correspondence is predominantly between and
         about family members, an appendix of genealogical information
         concerning the 
          Randolph family is attached. Although four
         of 
          Robert Carter Randolph's sons joined the
         Confederate forces during the Civil War, this collection does
         not contain any correspondence from that period.</p>
      <p>Of special note are letters from various 
          Randolphs who attended the 
          University of Virginia and describe their
         life and activities as students, including 
          Archibald C. Randolph (1852 October 3, 17
         and 24; November 7, 14, 21, and 24; and December 8 and 13), 
          William Wellford Randolph (1856 January 20),
         and 
          William Wellford Randolph (1882 November 19;
         and 1883 March 18).</p>
      <p>Also of interest are letters mentioning slavery (1851 January
         9; 1852 January 4; 1853 January 9 and 12); minnie guns for 
          Robert Carter Randolph's company (1859
         November 26); carpetbaggers (1870 March 12); and the "Old Chapel"
         (1877 May 8 and 15; and 1881 May 20). There are many letters
         from 
          Isham Randolph, a civil engineer of
         national reputation, some of which pertain to his early career
         with the 
          Chicago and 
          Western Indiana Railroad Company. Other
         topics of interest include the genealogical letters of 
          Kate Randolph Sheets written in 1874, and
         letters expressing religious sentiments and describing
         religious events throughout the collection.</p>
