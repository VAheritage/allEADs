      <p>There are six photographs, ca. 1891, of the construction
         site of the Gladys Inn in Clifton Forge, Virginia. The
         photographs consist of three overall views of the hotel
         building, two of a group of the workers posed on the porch and
         stoop of the building, and one of a small side building. The
         construction workers are seen in all six photographs.</p>
      <p>According to Elizabeth Hicks Corron's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Clifton Forge Virginia</title>[Rare
         Books F234.C63C6 1971], the Chesapeake and Ohio Development
         Company commenced the erection of many business buildings in
         West Clifton Forge during the early 1890s. M. E. Ingalls,
         president of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company, gave the
         dedication address in 1891 for the large frame hotel erected
         by C &amp; O, which was named the Gladys Inn in honor of his
         daughter. Mr. C. P. Nair and his family came from Glasgow,
         Virginia, where he had been the manager of the Natural Bridge
         Hotel, to operate the inn. In 1896, the Gladys Inn was
         remodeled into the C &amp; O Hospital, and the Gladys Inn
         moved into a new building erected on Ridgeway Street, Clifton
         Forge. This new establishment housed the C &amp; O passenger
         station and a restaurant and became the leading hotel in that
         section of Virginia.</p>
