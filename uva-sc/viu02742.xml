      <p>The collection consists chiefly of correspondence between
         booksellers, collectors and scholars about the collecting and
         studying of the works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Topics
         discussed include first editions, inscriptions in Longfellow's
         hand, a diary describing a meeting with Longfellow in Europe
         in 1835, an autograph dedication to Longfellow, and a
         previously unattributed Longfellow poem, a photograph of which
         is included.</p>
