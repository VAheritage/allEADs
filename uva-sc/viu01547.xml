      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This is a 1865 morocco wallet diary which belonged to
         Private John Mottram, Company K, 13th New Hampshire
         Volunteers, Army of the James. The inside cover bears two
         inscriptions: "Steal not this Book for fear of shame for here
         you see the owners name" and "Mr. John Mottram Co. K 13th N.
         H. Chaffin's Farm Va Genl Ords Head Quarters." The 13th New
         Hampshire, part of the 2nd Division under the command of
         General Edward Ord, was stationed near Chaffin's Farm (Fort
         Harrison). Mottram, a thirty-six-year-old Portsmouth resident,
         enlisted in the regiment on September 20, 1862 and served
         until mustered out on June 21, 1865. [See S. Millett Thompson,
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Thirteenth Regiment Of New Hampshire
         Volunteer Infantry In The War Of The Rebellion
         1861-1865</title>(Boston: Houghton, Mifflin And Company,
         1888), page 682]. Throughout the diary Mottram is merely an
         observer and chronicler of events and typically employs the
         phrases "This Morning is very fine" or "All is well." The
         majority of the entries are in ink; synopses of several are
         appended at the end of this guide.</p>
      <p>Prefaced by the usual calendar, population, distance, rates
         of postage, eclipses and other tables of information, entries
         are brief due to the limited number of lines allotted for each
         day during the period of January 1 to July 3, 1865. His
         regiment was among those participating in the Union Army's
         nine-month siege of Petersburg and it later saw duty during
         the occupation of Richmond. There are numerous references to
         drills, inspections, dress parades, rifle practice (with
         blanks), picket duty, and the arrival of Confederate
         deserters. Other members of the 13th New Hampshire mentioned
         by name are Captain Matthew T. Betton (who receives a haircut
         from Mottram on February 13) and Lieutenant Colonel Normand
         Smith; also of interest is Mottram's mention of the 13th New
         Hampshire's posing for a daguerreotype (February 3).</p>
      <p>Mottram mentions several prominent Union generals (Ulysses
         Grant, Benjamin Butler, John Gibbon, William T. Sherman) and
         civilians (Abraham Lincoln and members of his cabinet) as
         visitors to the front and claims to have seen Confederate
         General Robert E. Lee and his staff across the lines (January
         16). He also is a eyewitness to the departure of the
         Confederate peace commissioners [Vice-President Alexander
         Stephens (1812- 1883), Judge John A. Campbell (1811-1889), and
         Senator Robert M. T. Hunter (1809-1887)] for talks with
         President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State William H.
         Seward during what later became known as the Hampton Roads
         Peace Conference (February 9). Other entries of interest
         include: desertions by members of the 81st New York (January
         21 and April 2); doughnuts for dinner (February 19); black
         Union troops reviewed by General Gibbon (March 14); a member
         of the 12th New Hampshire shot for desertion (February 9); and
         St. Patrick's Day celebrations during a grand review held for
         Lincoln and Grant (March 17).</p>
      <p>Private Mottram misplaced his diary and had to search the
         camp for it (March 4); he also witnessed the capture of
         Richmond on 3 April and was among the first Federal troops to
         enter the city. He has nothing good to say about the
         Confederate capital, its paroled rebels or African-Americans
         residents; indeed, he agrees with the decision by the Union
         military ordering blacks to leave (April 3-19). During this
         period he notes Lincoln's visit to the city (April 13); the
         starving condition of Manchester residents (April 5); and the
         arrival of Governor Francis Pierpont (May 11). (On the diary's
         back inside cover Mottram's address during the occupation is
         given as "Richmond, 5th Street/April 7, 1865.")</p>
      <p>There are no entries from July 3 to August 20 and August 22
         to December 31, 1865. However, for August 21 there is a
         pencilled reference to a report by the Secretary of the Navy
         on "the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Polaris Castaways</title>." [43rd
         Congress, 1st session, executive document 1, part 3]. This is
         in reference to an ill-fated U. S. naval arctic expedition of
         1871-1873 during which its commander was murdered by arsenic.
         [The report is found in 43rd Congress, 1st session, executive
         document 1, part 3. For a narrative of this expedition see
         Pierre Berton, 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Arctic Grail</title>(New York:
         Viking, 1988), Chapter 9.]</p>
      <p>The back pages of the diary contain various memoranda
         notations, apparently jotted down by Mottram to add details of
         specific events, especially those omitted from his
         chronological entries. They include or make mention of: a
         longer description of the 13th New Hampshire's entry into
         Richmond; (April 2); Lincoln's Richmond visit (April 2); a
         lieutenant arrested for shooting a picket and later hanged
         (February 7 &amp; 18); and a soldier shot for desertion (March
         26). Also present in this section is a list of battles
         [1862-1864] in which the 13th participated, a roll of Company
         K members who enlisted at Portsmouth; cash accounts, 1865 and
         1872; prices for items of clothing, 1864-1865; and "The
         Japanese hair stain (?) of S. G. Upham(?), 25 South 8th
         Street, Philadelphia," apparently a series of minature
         watercolor designs.</p>
