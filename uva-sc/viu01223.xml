      <p>This collection consists of the papers of John Morgan, of
         Mount Jackson, Shenandoah County, Virginia, and later Poca,
         Putnam County, West Virginia, including other members of his
         family, twenty-two items, consisting of correspondence,
         1843-1864, chiefly involving slavery, secession, and the Civil
         War service of brothers, James B. Morgan and William S.
         Morgan; and correspondence and account, 1884-1893, of John
         Morgan with A.R. Ellerson &amp; Company, Wool Buyers,
         Richmond, Virginia, concerning the purchase of his wool.</p>
      <p>The correspondence includes the following topics and
         correspondents: description of the sale of a slave, Cajah,
         without his prior knowledge to prevent his running away (John
         G. Meem, 1843 Dec 6); the purchase of a slave man and his
         wife, whom he hopes to send over by Mr Koontz, and discussion
         of the need of an unnamed company to get stone to build their
         abutments from the stone quarry (John G. Meem, 1843 Dec 15);
         and a discussion about the Richmond Convention, the Baltimore
         Convention, the presidential candidates Stephen A. Douglas and
         John C. Breckinridge, the "Seceders," part of the Democratic
         party determined not to have Douglas on any platform, and many
         volunteers forming military companies (Stephen Lee Morgan,
         1860 Jun 21).</p>
      <p>Additional topics include: arrangements to make uniforms
         for Morgan's company (J.P. Carpenter, 1861 Feb 19); request
         for a vest, black pants, and his father's dirk (J.B. Morgan,
         Camp Letcher, Bonders Riflemen, Buffalo, Virginia (1861 May);
         notification to his brother, William S. Morgan, Company A,
         36th Regiment, Virginia Volunteers, that they are about to
         move their camp from the New River at Narrows, Virginia (J.B.
         Morgan, 1862 Jul 21); and J.B. Morgan reports from the Dublin
         Depot, Virginia, to his mother that his brigade had been in a
         number of engagements during the winter and at the fight of
         Jonesville, he was wounded on the side of the head with a
         piece of shell, and complains at not recieving any mail from
         home (1864 Apr 19).</p>
