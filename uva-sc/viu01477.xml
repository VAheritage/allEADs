      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of two manuscript account books,
         1799 and 1800, detailing the expenditures and itinerary of a
         Connecticut surveyor while on two surveying trips to Virginia,
         present-day West Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky. For the
         most part, references to towns, counties and states reflect
         the geographic realities of 1799-1800. The unnamed Connecticut
         surveyor was employed by the Springfield Virginia Land Company
         to correctly survey and prove legal title to lands claimed in
         Southwest Virginia and Kentucky. He corresponded with George
         Bliss and Gideon Granger about his progess.</p>
      <p>The account books record the Surveyor's expenses for
         lodging, food and spirits, barber's bills, ferry tolls, repair
         work for equipment, feed for horses, and other horse related
         expenditures, washing of clothes, payments to blacks for
         various services, fees related to his surveying activities and
         court fees, postage, entertainment, and paper. He also
         mentions taverns and other places where he stayed or ate a
         meal, his itinerary, the weather, and conditions of the
         countryside.</p>
      <p>The titles of many of the large tracts of land purchased by
         speculators in this area were badly recorded and became a
         matter of frequent dispute as the lands became more valuable.
         By 1800, nearly every piece of land was subject to controversy
         in the courts about the same time. The Surveyor records his
         travels on the Wilderness Road during part of his surveying
         activity.</p>
