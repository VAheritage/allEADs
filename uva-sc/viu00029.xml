      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection of 290 items, 1814-1945, contains material
         pertaining to several Scotch-Irish families from which the
         donor 
         <persname>Warren Coleman,</persname>M.D. is descended. The
         collection chiefly revolves around 
         <persname>Robert Houston McEwen</persname>(1790-1868) and his
         wife 
         <persname>Henrietta "Hetty" Montgomery Kennedy
         McEwen</persname>(1796-1881).</p>
      <p><persname>Robert H. McEwen</persname>'s and 
         <persname>Hetty Kennedy</persname>'s families moved from 
         <geogname>Washington County, Virginia</geogname>to the 
         <geogname>Tennessee</geogname>territory in the late eighteenth
         century. His father, a surgeon in the 
         <corpname>Continental Army</corpname>during the Revolutionary
         War, died when Robert was quite young, so that Robert was
         reared by his mother and became very close to her family, the 
         <famname>Houston Family</famname>. Hetty was the daughter of 
         <persname>Robert Campbell Kennedy</persname>, who pioneered in
         <geogname>Tennessee</geogname>'s 
         <geogname>Lincoln County</geogname>. Kennedy became a very
         prosperous farmer and miller, and a good friend of 
         <persname>Andrew Jackson</persname>. Both 
         <persname>Robert McEwen</persname>and 
         <persname>Hetty Kennedy</persname>'s older brother 
         <persname>William Kennedy</persname>joined the 
         <corpname>United States Army</corpname>to fight in the Creek
         War Campaign of the War of 1812. They participated in the
         Battle of 
         <geogname>Horseshoe Bend</geogname>, and McEwen, a lieutenant,
         drew a map of the battle the morning after their victory (the
         original is preserved in the 
         <corpname>Library of Congress</corpname>).</p>
      <p>After they were mustered out in May 1814, McEwen visited
         Kennedy at his family's home and there met his friend's
         younger sister Hetty. McEwen and 
         <persname>Hetty Kennedy</persname>were married the next year
         and set up housekeeping in 
         <geogname>Fayetteville, Tennessee</geogname>, where McEwen
         owned a dry goods store, among whose customers were many
         members of the Cherokee nation. In 1828 the McEwens moved to 
         <corpname>Nashville, Tennessee</corpname>in order to provide
         their children with better schooling and more cultural
         activities. The couple had ten children, seven of whom lived
         past infancy. In 
         <geogname>Nashville</geogname>, McEwen opened another dry
         goods store which proved very successful. In 1836 the 
         <corpname>Tennessee State Legislature</corpname>elected him
         Superintendent of Public Schools, a position he held for four
         years. After he left government service, he ran the collection
         service for 
         <corpname>Eastern Merchants, Brokers, and
         Bankers</corpname>for the rest of his working life.</p>
      <p>The McEwens were a well-known and prosperous family; their
         sons went to college and their daughters married professional
         men. Their youngest daughter 
         <persname>"Kitty" McEwen</persname>was sent on trips north and
         then to 
         <geogname>Europe</geogname>for her health. She met a young
         physician, 
         <persname>John Scott Coleman</persname>, from 
         <geogname>Augusta, Georgia</geogname>, in the party on this
         tour; they were subsequently married in 1867. Dr. and Mrs.
         Coleman were the parents of 
         <persname>Warren Coleman</persname>, the donor.</p>
      <p>The family was also known for its piety and patriotism.
         They were devout Presbyterians, with McEwen serving as an
         elder for thirty years. Politically they were 
         <corpname>Whigs</corpname>who despised the 
         <corpname>Democratic party</corpname>. Although they had
         African-American servants they vehemently opposed the breakup
         of the Union in the 1860s. Throughout the war 
         <persname>Hetty McEwen</persname>insisted on flying a
         hand-made Union flag from her roof. After Union troops
         captured the city in 1862, her flag was replaced by a silk
         flag given by the Federal Commander in respect for her
         bravery. In the postwar period this incident became part of
         local legend and poems were written to commemorate "Hetty's
         brave deed."</p>
      <p>The McEwen offspring grew up to found long-lived and
         similarly prosperous families who revered their ancestors and
         cared for the family heirlooms. Many of the family treasures
         had come to 
         <persname>Kitty McEwen Coleman</persname>, who willed them to
         her son Warren when she died in 1929. At that time the McEwen
         descendents, led by Dr. Coleman, collectively decided that
         their family papers and heirlooms of historical interest
         should be made accessible to the public and donated them to
         various archives and museums. Among the most interesting were
         the original map of the Battle of 
         <geogname>Horseshoe Bend</geogname>, and several items
         pertaining to the War of 
         <geogname>Texas</geogname>Independence (including General 
         <persname>Santa Anna</persname>'s jewelled saddle) given to 
         <persname>Robert McEwen</persname>by his first cousin 
         <persname>Sam Houston</persname>.</p>
      <p>The collection is valuable for the light it sheds on
         pioneer and early nineteenth century life in the upper South.
         The folders of letters and memoirs are probably the most
         interesting and entertaining items, detailing domestic and
         social life, and the genealogical materials also record family
         and thus local history of 
         <geogname>Nashville</geogname>and its residents. The travel
         journal kept by 
         <persname>Kitty McEwen Coleman</persname>on her 1859 European
         tour is an excellent source for European as well as American
         social history, and the account of the voyage home is more
         harrowing than fiction could be.</p>
