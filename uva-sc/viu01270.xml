      <p>Lucien W. Richardson enlisted at Williamsburg in May 1861
         as a member of the 1st Virginia Artillery, Company B, James
         City Artillery, eventually reaching the rank of captain. (In
         some records Richardson's first name is spelled "Lucian.") He
         remained with this unit when it became the 1st Battalion
         Virginia Light Artillery, Co. B, James City Artillery and
         later an independent unit, Captain Lucien W. Richardson's
         Battery of Virginia Artillery. Detailed to enrolling duty in
         January 1863, Richardson's poor health led to his reassignment
         to duty in Richmond by order of the Confederate Secretary of
         War. By December 1863 Richardson was a staff officer for
         General John H. Winder (1800-1865), provost marshal of
         Richmond.</p>
      <p>Two June 1864 inspection reports describe Richardson as
         commandant of Castle Thunder (a Richmond prison part of the
         Eastern District Military Prison system and used to house
         Union and political prisoners) in charge of three lieutenants
         and commended for his "most excellent system of records and
         registry . . . office books are neatly and accurately kept,
         and exhibit a complete and comprehensive record of each
         prisoner received." One inspection reported noted "Captain R.
         is applying to be retired." [Jeffrey C. Weaver,

      <p>William B. G. Andrews enlisted as a private with the 10th
         Battalion Virginia Heavy Artillery [also know as "Allen's
         Battalion Virginia Heavy Artillery"], Company C [Allen
         Artillery] in Patrick County in February 1862 and was
         eventually promoted from corporal (1862) to sergeant (March
         1863) to second lieutenant (October 1863). Ironically, in
         April 1865, he was captured by Union forces in Richmond,
         became a prisoner of war and hospitalized at a the Point of
         Rocks hospital suffering from diarrhea. Shortly after his
         transfer to Newport News, Andrews died in June 1865 of chronic
         diarrhea. [Jeffrey C. Weaver, 10th and 19th Battalions of
         Heavy Artillery (Lynchburg, Virginia: H. E. Howard, Inc.,

      <p>This 1864 manuscript document, "Morning Report of Capt. L.
         W. Richardson, Assistant Provost Marshal, Eastern District
         Military Station, A. P. Marshal's Office, Richmond, Va., April
         27, 1864" lists fifty-eight prisoners, both Union and
         Confederate soldiers (all privates) and civilians, men and
         women, blacks and whites, confined or released from Castle
         Thunder Prison, Richmond. It provides details including date
         of incarceration, regiment and state, cause of arrest, and
         other details. L. W. Richardson signed it as "Capt. &amp; APM
         [Assistant Provost Marshal], Comd [Commanding?]," and
         countersigned by "Officer of the Guard Lt. W. G. B. Andrews,
         Co. C, 10 VA. Battery Hy. Artillery" [2nd Lieutenant William
         B. G. Andrews, Company C, 10th Battalion Virginia Heavy
         Artillery]. The verso file docket bears the notation "Report
         Castle Thunder April 27 1864."</p>
      <p>A variety of charges are listed including desertion,
         espionage, attempted escape, and aiding the enemy ("Yankees").
         Column headings include: "Committed/ Names/ Rank/ Company/
         State/ Cause of Arrest/ By Whom Arrested/ Date of Arrest/

         Hospital/ Returned from Hospital/ By Whom Discharged/ No. Of
         Order/ To Whom Delivered/ Date of Release/ Remarks." The lower
         "half" of the document lists several prisoners apparently
         released ("Discharges") on 27 April 1864; most had been taken
         into custody between November 1863 and April 1864. Twenty of
         these prisoners, mostly Union deserters, were either sent to
         Libby Prison where they were apparently freed: "Sent to Libby
         Prison on Special Order No. 101, discharged by General
         Winder." (John Henry Winder [1800- 1865] was provost marshal
         for Richmond and in charge of Union prisoners of war since
         1861.)</p>
      <p>Identified Confederate regiments include the 59th Alabama
         Infantry, 60th Alabama Infantry, 3rd Arkansas, 60th Georgia
