        <p>This collection was given to the Library by Mrs.
            Margaret DuPriest, c/o Bruccoli Clark Layman, Inc., of
            Columbia, South Carolina, on February 14, 1991, as part of
            the Joseph M. Bruccoli Great War Collection. The collection
            was purchased by the donor Mrs. DuPriest in 1980 from a
            warehouse sale in Brooklyn, New York, in an unspecified lot
            of miscellaneous books.</p>

      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The American Red Cross Mission to Russia consisting of
         twenty-nine personnel, was chaired by Dr. Frank Billings
         (1854-1932), a prominent physician of Chicago and expert on
         infectious disease. The business magnate William Boyce
         Thompson (1869-1930), who offered to pay the expenses of the
         expedition, accompanied the Mission as business manager and
         Dr. William S. Thayer (1864-1932), the professor of clinical
         medicine in the Johns Hopkins Medical School, was named
         Chairman of the Medical &amp; Scientific Group of the Mission.
         Additional information concerning Thompson's contribution to
         the Mission can be found in his biography 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Magnate William Boyce Thompson and
         His Time [1869-1930]</title>by Hermann Hagedorn. A closely
         related manuscript collection that also describes American Red
         Cross work is the Papers of C.T. Williams (#10746-a).</p>
      <p>The Mission traveled to Russia via Canada and Japan and
         arrived at Vladivostok on July 26, and Petrograd on August 7,
         1917. Their immediate goal was to give the seventy tons of
         medical and surgical supplies which they had brought with them
         to the Russian army, and to find a way to co-ordinate the
         relief activities of the three agencies whose chief work was
         to supply war relief; the Sanitary Department of the army, the
         Russian Red Cross, and the All Union of Zemstvos and
         Towns.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of three manuscripts by Dr.
         William Sydney Thayer (1864-1932) describing the American Red
         Cross Mission to Russia, July 1, 1917-February 10, 1918,
         during the time of the Russian Revolution, and based upon
         notes taken by Thayer as events were transpiring. Thayer's
         diary of 164 pages describes the progress of the Mission from
         the time of its official formation in St. Paul to its return
         to the United States eight months later. The two smaller
         manuscripts deal with the experiences of the members of the
         Mission during the precipitous week that the Mission spent in
         Moscow during some of the worst of the fighting between the
         Bolsheviks and the loyal troops.</p>
