      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>William Francis Rhea was born on a farm near Bristol,
         Virginia, on April 20, 1858, and attended rural and private
         schools. In 1878, he graduated from King College, Bristol,
         Tennessee, began to study law, and was admitted to the
         Virginia bar in 1879. Rhea served as a judge in both the
         Washington County Court and Bristol, Virginia, city court. He
         was first elected as a Democrat to the Virginia State Senate,
         1885-1888, and then served two terms in the United States
         Congress, 1899-1903. After his defeat in the 1902 election, he
         again practiced law in Bristol, until his appointment as a
         member of the State corporation commission, 1908-1925, when he
         lived in Richmond, Virginia, until his death in 1931.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of the political papers of
         Virginia Representative and judge of the Washington County
         Court (1880-1885) and the city court of Bristol, Virginia,
         William Francis Rhea (1858-1931), 1899- 1902, ca. 316 items (1
         Hollinger box), chiefly constituent mail and papers pertaining
         to the election dispute between Rhea and James Alexander
         Walker (1832-1901) in the 1898 Congressional election for the
         Ninth District of Virginia.</p>
      <p>Papers concerning the contested election are grouped
         together and include correspondence of the Campaign Committee
         with attorneys involved in the contest about their fees; other
         material about expenditures and fees connected to the disputed
         election; letters from registrars to Rhea regarding his
         request for lists of registered voters; miscellaneous
         documents and notes; lists of voting registrars in the 9th
         Congressional District; and Voting Rolls for Pulaski County
         and Russell County, Virginia, listing the registrar's name and
         address, and the voter's name, address, occupation and
         politics. According to the letters from the registrars to
         Rhea, most of them did not include the names of
         African-American voters on the voting rolls sent to Judge
         Rhea. Many of these African-American voters were expected to
         have cast Republican votes for Walker.</p>
      <p>Constituent mail is concerned with applications for
         patronage positions, especially with the Census Bureau and
         Post Office; requests from farmers for the free blackleg
         vaccine, flower bulbs, seeds, literature printed by the
         government, and school superintendent positions. There were
         also letters opposing the Loud Bill concerning second-class
         mailing fees.</p>
      <p>Other papers include financial documents of the Democratic
         Campaign Committee; an official ballot from the election held
         on November 6, 1900, with a letter from the Court Clerk
         Kilgore certifying its authenticity, January 8, 1902;
         Washington County receipts for [Claude] Swanson, 1901; a
         printed bill pertaining to copyright law and a report on
         "Measurements of Flow on the Holston River, Tennessee, June
         10, 1902."</p>
