      <p>In this collection of letters and postcards, Una Jeffers
         answers the request of Cortlandt Schoonover to buy smaller
         publications for his collection, mentioning several, noting
         that most were done without their knowledge, and sending and
         commenting on available ones, particularly 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">An Artist.</title></p>
      <p>In addition she sends a postcard of a view near their
         County Donegal farmhouse. Another note is on a postcard of
         Mission San Carlos Borromeo. Frederic Prokosch, Lincoln
         Steffens and the Grabhorn Press are also briefly mentioned.
         Finally, a cancelled check from Schoonover to Jeffers is
         included.</p>

               Jeffers items that are difficult to procure, "First let
               me say that we are both of us much opposed to small
               items. Each one of them has been forced out of us or
               come by surprise. (For instance the 
               <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Rock &amp; Hawk</title>was done
               by Frederic Prokosch before we ever heard of him for his
               own writing, he printed the poem from its first
               appearance in 
               <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Scribner</title>'s I believe, on
               his little hand press &amp; sent us all the copies but
               two I think for a surprise) and so on....But we believe
               that it puts an unfair burden on the average reader
               &amp; enthusiast to have so many little items to
               pursue"; also offers to give him a copy of Stars and an
               article on [George] Sterling; mentions a soiled copy of 
               <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">An Artist</title>, which was
               edited by Ella Winter and Lincoln Steffens (1866-1936)
               for a special 
               <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Carmelite</title>issue devoted to
               Robinson Jeffers in 1928, for sale by a friend; and
               mentions the possibility that in six months a
               photographer [H. Lyon] might publish, 
               <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Jeffers Country</title>, a book
               of West Coast photographs using captions based on
               Jeffers' own poems.</p>
