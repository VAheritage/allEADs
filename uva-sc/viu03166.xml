      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection is comprised of 111 items, 1735-1938,
         mostly papers from the families of both of Francis B.
         Harrison's parents--the Harrisons of New Orleans and the Carys
         of Virginia. Francis B. Harrison (1873- 1957) and his two
         brothers, Fairfax and Archibald, were born and reared in New
         York City, where their father Burton Harrison (1839?-1904),
         earlier President Jefferson Davis' private secretary, was an
         attorney.</p>
      <p>Their mother, Constance Cary Harrison (1843-1920), was the
         author of many articles and novels chronicling the life of the
         first families of Virginia. Through generations of marriage,
         the Carys were related to virtually all of the well-known
         Virginia clans: the Jeffersons, Carrs, Randolphs, Tuckers,
         Carters and the Lords Fairfax, and so her stories and articles
         carried a great air of authenticity. Her memoir, Recollections
         Grave and Gay (1911), fills in an important segment in the
         social history of the Southern noncombatant population during
         the Civil War</p>
      <p>Francis Harrison followed his brother Fairfax and his
         father in graduating from Yale, but thereafter pursued a
         career in politics. He served as congressman from New York in
         1903-05, and from 1907 to 1913, and Governor-General of the
         Philippine Islands from 1913 to 1921.</p>
      <p>Most of the items in the collection are inherited from his
         mother. They include originals and copies of his Grandfather
         Archibald Cary's letters, magazine articles written by his
         mother, copies of 18th century letters to family members, and
         miscellaneous letters of his mother's. From his father's
         family are included original newspaper editorials written by
         Jesse Burton Harrison, Francis B. Harrison's grandfather and
         the editor of the Louisiana Advertiser in 1836, and
         miscellaneous letters to J. B. Harrison written in the
         1830s.</p>
      <p>There are many items of interest to the social and
         political historian in this collection. Of special note are
         Archibald Cary's letters to his sister Patsy Jefferson Cary
         detailing trips to cities on the eastern seaboard (1837-1838),
         and his letters to his older brother Wilson Miles Cary. These
         letters comment faithfully on life in the deep South between
         1837 and 1843, dwelling on both social and political
         themes.</p>
      <p>The editorials written by J. B. Harrison on the eve of the
         1836 presidential election illustrate the Whig point of view,
         and grassroots political action and organization. Although
         difficult to decipher, the diary kept by J. B. Harrison in
         1829 and 1830 when he was studying in Germany gives valuable
         insights into European life and the later stages of the
         Romantic movement. The letter, ca. 1735, from Colonel William
         Byrd to Sir John Randolph provides an amusing exchange between
         two very prominent colonial Virginians. Likewise, the letter,
         1763, from Colonel Wilson Cary to his daughter Elizabeth, Lady
         Fairfax, provides a homely glimpse of the apex of colonial
         Virginia society.</p>
