      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists of the papers of the 
         <famname>Grattan</famname>, 
         <famname>Heneberger</famname>, 
         <famname>Roller</famname>, and 
         <famname>Shacklett</famname>families of the 
         <geogname>Rockingham County, Virginia</geogname>area,
         1841-1901, ca. 90 items. The papers include letters,
         photographs, genealogical information, and miscellaneous
         items, chiefly the correspondence of 
         <persname>Lucien Guy Heneberger</persname>(1851-), his sister,
         <persname>Ella Heneberger Grattan</persname>, and 
         <persname>Maggie Shacklett Roller</persname>.</p>
      <p>One letter is from former Governor 
         <persname>Thomas W. Gilmer</persname>, August 11, 1841, to 
         <persname>Robert Grattan</persname>, mentioning a letter he
         received from 
         <persname>John Thompson</persname>of 
         <geogname>Amherst, Virginia</geogname>, who was in charge of
         the management of their bank concerns, which asked Gilmer to
         advertise an estate for sale for fifteen dollars an acre.
         Gilmer begs Grattan to buy it and assures him the lowest
         possible price, says that the Bank Bill will be vetoed, and
         that the political parties will undergo the reorganization so
         long predicted and necessary. He also mentions that his
         friends have told him that the Whigs and Democrats are all
         against him at home.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous letters to Ella and 
         <persname>George Grattan</persname>, 1878-1894, discuss news
         of family and friends, and includes the following
         correspondents: 
         <persname>Kate Herring</persname>; 
         <persname>[Jeannie ?] Grattan</persname>; Cousin 
         <persname>Elizabeth Grattan</persname>; sister Mabel H [?] re
         a trip to 
         <geogname>New York</geogname>(1881 Oct 20); 
         <persname>Emily Gray</persname>; 
         <persname>Peachy R. Grattan</persname>; 
         <persname>G.W. [Harris</persname>?]; 
         <persname>Belle R. Harrison</persname>; 
         <persname>G.G. Grattan, Sr.</persname>; and 
         <persname>Mattie P. Myers</persname>.</p>
      <p>Letters from 
         <persname>Lucien Guy Heneberger</persname>(1851-?), a 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>alumnus who
         attended from 1869-1871, to 
         <persname>Ella Grattan</persname>, his sister, 1878-1883, were
         mostly written while a United States Naval Surgeon aboard the
         USS Trenton, the flagship of the European fleet, stationed off
         the coast of 
         <geogname>France</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Italy</geogname>. His first letter, December 27,
         1878, was written while Heneberger was still at the Naval
         Hospital in 
         <geogname>Washington, D.C.</geogname>and mentions his
         application for sea duty aboard the USS Trenton. In his next
         letter, January 5, 1879, he describes the presentation of all
         Naval officers to President 
         <persname>Rutherford B. Hayes</persname>at the 
         <corpname>White House</corpname>, a social in the Blue Room
         with music by the full marine band, and his other New Year
         Day's activities. Later correspondence refers to the
         possiblitity of proceeding to the scene of excitement in
         Turkish waters (1880 Oct 3); the presidential election of
         1880, in which Lucien favors 
         <persname>Winfield S. Hancock</persname>over 
         <persname>James A. Garfield</persname>(1880 Nov 3); the sight
         of 
         <geogname>Mount Vesuvius</geogname>belching forth fire and
         lava and trying to select bronzes and paintings in 
         <geogname>Italy</geogname>for his brother-in-law's parlor
         (1880 Nov 15); and meeting the daughter of 
         <persname>William Cullen Bryant</persname>at a party (1881 Jan
         1).</p>
      <p><persname>Charles Colcock Jones, Jr.</persname>has written
         three letters to 
         <persname>George Grattan</persname>, two about information
         given to Jones by Grattan about the Civil War battle of 
         <geogname>Ocean Pond</geogname>( 
         <geogname>Olustee</geogname>) used in his book 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Historical Sketch of the Chatham Artillery</title></bibref>(1868 Jan 27 &amp; Feb 3). The third letter is also
         about his Civil War research in which he asks Grattan to help
         him illustrate his roster of a company with autographs of all
         general officers (1872 Jul 12).</p>
      <p>General 
         <persname>Samuel H. Lewis</persname>, 
         <geogname>Lewiston</geogname>, writes a letter of sympathy
         upon the death of 
         <persname>Robert Grattan</persname>to Grattan's wife, August
         27, 1855, and shares a resolution passed by the County Court
         of 
         <geogname>Rockingham</geogname>(of which Grattan was formerly
         a member).</p>
      <p>There is one letter from 
         <persname>Matthew Fontaine Maury</persname>, March 18, 1869,
         to 
         <persname>George G. Grattan</persname>, discussing mining in 
         <geogname>Augusta County</geogname>, his fees, and his offer
         of help in getting one of the 
         <corpname>Virginia Military Institute</corpname>professors to
         analyze the ores.</p>
      <p><persname>Franklin Minor</persname>, the head of 
         <corpname>Ridgeway School</corpname>in 
         <geogname>Albemarle County</geogname>, writes to 
         <persname>Robert Grattan</persname>, September 17, 1854,
         discussing the school and a visit by 
         <persname>Matthew Fontaine Maury</persname>, who is described
         as being "a perfect jewel of original thought and learning."
         Minor also mentions the completion of Maury's book 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">The Physical Geography of the Sea</title></bibref>.</p>
      <p>The correspondence in accession 11019-a is chiefly that of 
         <persname>Maggie Shacklett Roller</persname>, wife of General 
         <persname>John E. Roller</persname>(married ca. 1878). In a
         letter to Mrs. 
         <persname>Carrie Roller</persname>, August 21, 1878, 
         <persname>Maggie Roller</persname>describes a trip (possibly
         her honeymoon) to 
         <geogname>Europe</geogname>with General 
         <persname>John E. Roller</persname>, naming 
         <geogname>Ireland</geogname>as her favorite place. A letter
         from Emily H. F [?], March 27, [1896], discusses her
         difficulties in securing a position with a family and
         supporting herself and her mother and shows strongly the
         plight of an unmarried woman trying to support herself in the
         nineteenth century. 
         <persname>Louisa A. Kemper</persname>writes, October 13,
         [n.y.], to General Roller concerning the health of her husband
         from the 
         <corpname>National Military Home</corpname>in 
         <geogname>Montgomery County, Ohio</geogname>.</p>
      <p>Other correspondence includes brief letters from 
         <persname>William Shands</persname>; 
         <persname>Winfield Liggett</persname>; 
         <persname>Alexander Wendell</persname>(a letter of sympathy,
         April 3, 1871); 
         <persname>Betty Brockman</persname>(school news, August 16,
         1872); 
         <persname>John Hart</persname>, headmaster of Maggie's school,
         to 
         <persname>Henry Shacklett</persname>re Maggie's school work
         (June 14, 1873); and 
         <persname>Thomas L. Broun</persname>to Judge Grattan enclosing
         a photograph of General Lee and Grattan (not present, December
         28, 1901).</p>
      <p>Photographs in both accessions include: 
         <persname>Lucien Guy Heneberger</persname>, while a student at
         the 
         <corpname>University of Virginia</corpname>, 1871; 
         <persname>Sallie Watson Magruder</persname>, a school mate at
         " 
         <corpname>Piedmont</corpname>, "

         <persname>Clayton Williams</persname>, 
         <geogname>Winchester, Virginia</geogname>, [187?]; and school
         friends of
