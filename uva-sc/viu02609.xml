      <p>The papers consist chiefly of letters to Marion and Norman
         Perry discussing his writing. Topics include finances and need
         for remunerative work, possibly for Readers Digest;
         watercolors; lack of political beliefs; admiration for Paul
         Klee and Hans Reichel; Picasso and Guernica; and personal news
         including the birth of his daughter Valentine.</p>
      <p>He also mentions prices for and new editions of "Tropic of
         Capricorn"; book review work and possibilities; the American
         Library Service; radio scriptwriting; friends Robert Swasey
         and Herbert F. West; the work of Abe Rattner, Jack Levine,
         Louis Ferdinand Celine, Marc Chagall, Max Jacob, George Leite,
         Bern Porter, Brassa&amp;#35436; Ghika,and Leo Lerman.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains a clipping of a review of
         Miller's "The Air-conditioned nightmare" by Orville
         Prescott.</p>

                  Gotham Book Mart, Argus Book Shop, and Satyr Book
                  Shop. Miller then goes on to ask if she knows any
                  editors of book columns because he is trying to get
                  book review work to do since "my royalties are
                  practically nil. I am always in desperate shape.

                  just the other day - for the 'advance' on the book.
                  After all deductions had been made, for taxes &amp;
                  commissions, my part of the original 25 pounds came

            <p>Discusses Paul Klee (1879-1940) and the German
                  painter Hans Reichel, "I too am fanatically in love
                  with Klee's work. And of course it is true that
                  Reichel is a lesser Klee, that he derives from him,
                  that he once (maybe always) admired him greatly. They
                  were friends - they both played the violin. Reichel's
                  wife, incidentally, was a violinist. She too, I
                  learned from him, became an alcoholic - in Spain.
                  Everything about Reichel's life is tragic, painfully
                  tragic, and yet who could be more wondrous than
                  Reichel? I spent many hours with him - and finally
                  had to push him from me. Klee I like better than any
                  modern painter, even better than Picasso. Klee is
                  exactly what I seek - what I dream - in painting. And
                  like Bach, he seems to have exhausted this elected
                  realm." Miller goes on to compare the two men in
                  great detail, saying of Reichel, "I owe so much to
                  him. He is not for America. We would never begin to
                  appreciate his particular genius."</p>

            <p>In the enclosed letter discussed above Miller
                  states the type of work he is willing to do, "I won't
                  do anything that goes against the grain . . .that's
                  the chief thing to know, I guess. As for 
                  <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Reader's Digest</title>, I
                  must confess I never read it. I don't ready any
                  magazines, unless they're thrust on me, for some
                  particular reason. I have done a few book reviews
                  lately - without in any way traducing myself - for 
                  <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Nation</title>, 
                  <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New Republic</title>,

                  etc. The pay is very poor, considering the amount of
                  time effort required to do a conscientious job. But,
                  since I cannot and will not write the kind of stories
                  and articles which pay I am obliged to do book
                  reviews. What I should like, naturally, is to find an
                  editor who would give me two or three books a month -
                  the less the better - just sufficient to keep me
                  going."</p>

                  possibility of working on radio scripts for the
                  University of Chicago, which Dryer says is unlikely
                  because presently they have no dramatic program on
                  the networks and due to the nature of the their
                  scripts they cannot employ anyone residing outside of
