         <p>This collection consists of the papers of the McCutchan
         family, ca. 1769-1895, and undated, 110 items, including
         correspondence, financial and legal papers, poetry, and
         genealogical notes.</p>
         <p>The first McCutchan on record in this collection is William
         McCutchan of Augusta County, Virginia, born November 27, 1758
         and died June 29, 1848, who married Jane Finley, born February
         4, 1770 and died June 18, 1852. The couple had nine children,
         including John, born February 10, 1794; Samuel, born April 17,
         1795; Robert, born January 29, 1797; [Marthy], born December
         6, 1800; William Jr., born September 8, 1802; James, born July
         12, 1804; Elizabeth, born December 18, 1806; Sarah, born
         October 22, 1808 and Mary, born December 22, 1810. The
         children of John were William and John, and the child of James
         was Isabelle Finley McCutchan, who married Stuart S. Brown,
         the Confederate soldier whose letters are in this
         collection.</p>
         <p>
            <title render="bold">Correspondence</title>
            <lb/>Letters in this collection deal primarily with family,
         living conditions and matters relating to daily life. There
         are several of particular interest during the period of the
         Civil War to and from Stuart S. Brown, (husband of Isabelle
         Finley McCutchan), a Confederate soldier reportedly captured
         February 6, 1864 at Waterford, Morton's Ford, Va., and sent to
         Old Capitol Prison, Washington D.C. Brown died on February 12,
         1865 at Fort Delaware, where he had been transferred. On
         February 10, 1864, Brown writes Isabelle about his capture and
         his transfer to the prison. He lists names of others taken
         with him and mentions that he is being treated kindly.</p>
         <p>On March 17, 1864, he writes his wife that he has been ill
         but now is better. On March 24, 1864, Brown tells his brother
         that he hears talk that he might be exchanged--that he has
         received no mail since his arrival at prison, and that he has
         heard preaching only twice. A cousin, James P. Harris, writes
         Brown on July 28, 1864, that he is doing everything he can to
         have him released. Brown receives a letter dated November 24,
         1864 from his sister Ann Brown, Bloomington, Ill., in which
         she tells of the hardships at home.</p>
         <p>Ann Brown receives a letter from her brother dated December
         1, 1864, in which he describes being ill for two weeks in the
         hospital and requests that she send clothing. Brown writes his
         sister on February 1, 1865, that he is back in the hospital
         with bronchitis. A letter dated September 15, 1866, to Mrs.
         Brown from H. E. Brockman, a friend, consoles her on the loss
         of her husband.</p>
