      <p>The 27th USCT was organized as a three-year regiment at
         Camp Delaware, Ohio, January 16, 1864, and ordered to
         Annapolis, Maryland. It was attached to the 1st Brigade, 4th
         Division, 9th Corps, Army of the Potomac, to September 1864,
         the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, 9th Corps, and also the 1st
         Brigade, 1st Division, 25th Corps (the Union army's only
         all-black corps), December 1864. The regiment was attached to
         the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, 25th Corps, to January, 1865,
         the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, 25th Corps, to March 1865, the
         3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, 10th Corps, Department of North
         Carolina, to July, 1865, and the Department of North Carolina
         to September 1865.</p>
      <p>The regiment participated in several campaigns in Virginia
         and North Carolina: from the Rapidan to the James River,
         Virginia, May-June 1864; guarding wagon trains of the Army of
         the Potomac during the Wilderness campaign; the Petersburg
         campaign (including the battle of the Crater, July 30, 1864),
         June-December 1864. It fought at Weldon Railroad (August
         1864), Poplar Grove Church (September and October 1864), and
         Bodyton Plank Road, Hatcher's Run (October 1864). It fought at
         the Bermuda Hundred (Virginia) front until December 1864; from
         there it participated in the Fort Fisher (North Carolina)
         campaign (December 1864- January 1865), and subsequent actions
         (Sugar Loaf Hill, Federal Point, Fort Anderson, the capture of
         Wilmington, and Northeast Ferry), January-February 1865.</p>
      <p>It participated in the Carolinas campaign (March-April
         1865) including Kinston and Goldsboro and Cox's Bridge (March
         1865) and was among the Union regiments that captured and
         occupied Raleigh, North Carolina (April 1865). Present at the
         surrender of Army of the Tennessee (Confederate) at Bennett's
         House, North Carolina, on April 26, 1865, the regiment
         remained on duty in the Department of North Carolina until
         mustered out on September 21, 1865. [Francis M. Weld,

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This item is a manuscript document of a Civil War
         African-American unit, "Muster Roll of Captain Albert Rogall,
         Company G, of the Twenty-Seventh Regiment of U. S. Colored
         Troop Infantry, United State Army, Colonel [Albert] M.
         Blackman, from the Thirtieth day of April 1864, when last
         mustered, to the Thirtieth day of June 1864"/Payroll of the
         Company, from the Date of Enrollment, when last paid, to the
         Thirtieth day of June, 1864." Measuring 54 x 79 centimeters,
         it was prepared at Prince George Court House, Virginia, June
         30, 1864, by Captain Albert Rogall. Its lists eighty-one
         officers, noncommissioned officers and privates (individually
         numbered). A modified listing of the officers and enlisted men
         of Company G are appended to this guide.</p>
      <p>The document contains ca. twenty-seven column headings
         including names, dates and places of enlistment, and pay
         dates. Most of the company enlisted between February and April
         1864 in Delaware County (Camp Delaware), Ohio; the "Remarks"
         column shows some soldiers were absent on sick leave or
         detached and special duty. The payroll columns show the
         privates' pay as totaling $13.16 for two months; they either
         signed their names or made their marks ("x") beside them.
         Payments (totaling $2,830.44 for the entire company), were
         witnessed either by Captain Rogall or Second Lieutenant John
         Eberhardt. Rogall, later a lieutenant colonel of the 118th
         USCT, was actually a Polish nobleman named Florien Albert
         Rogall de Salmonski who came to America in 1851. Garold Cole,

         1955-1986</title>(Columbia, South Carolina: University of
         South Carolina Press, 1988), 91. (His name appears as "Royall"
         in some published sources.)</p>
      <p>The bottom verso notes the results of a report by
         Inspection and Mustering Officer Charles I. Wright concerning
         the company ("Discipline: Good," "Instruction: Wanting,"
         "Military Appearance: Fair," "Arms: In Good Condition,"
         "Accoutrements: In Good Condition," "Clothing: In Good
         Condition"). Personal servants (most likely African-Americans)
         employed by the officers include John Brown (Captain Rogall),
         John [Root?] (1st Lieutenant George W. Doty) and Henry Curtis
         (Lieutenant Eberhardt). Also of interest is "A List of Rolls,
         Returns, and Reports From Company Commanders of Volunteer
         Forces" which identifies the types of forms required of
         military units and when and to whom they should be
         submitted.</p>
