      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists of the papers of Senator 
         <persname>Claude A. Swanson</persname>of 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>(1862-1939), 1917-1922, ca. 6,400
         items (16 Hollinger boxes, 6.5 linear feet) primarily
         correspondence with constituents and fellow congressmen
         concerning bills in the Senate, constituent needs and
         requests, appointments and invitations, all related to his
         senatorial career. Common constituent concerns include claims
         against various federal and state agencies, especially the 
         <corpname>United States Army</corpname>, pardons for family
         members and friends, difficulties with foreign governments,
         personal problems, the loss of personal effects of soldiers,
         liberty bonds, requests for letters of introduction and
         recommendation, and questions about government surplus from
         World War I.</p>
      <p>Also present are several printed items, including a
         dedication ceremony program of a Virginia Historical Highway
         Marker honoring Swanson; an article about Swanson by 
         <persname>Henry H. Mitchell</persname>; copies of a Yorktown
         Sesquicentennial Celebration program, a silver service
         presentation to the Battleship Virginia, and a song "Our
         Governor Elect" by 
         <persname>Blanche Hardy Consolvo</persname>; and a bound
         scrapbook of electrostatic copies of newsclippings and other
         contemporary documents taken from the Swanson family
         collection of newspaper articles, photographs and papers, and
         compiled by 
         <persname>Charles C. Hall</persname>in 1992.</p>
      <p>Swanson was born on March 31, 1862, at Swansonville,
         Virginia, and educated at Randolph-Macon College (1885) and
         the University of Virginia (law degree in 1886). He returned
         to 
         <geogname>Pittsylvania County</geogname>and practiced law
         until elected to the House of Representatives, serving from
         1893-1906. Swanson was governor of 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>, 1906-1910, and immediately
         following his term as governor he was appointed to fill the
         United States Senate seat left vacant by the death of Senator
         John Daniel. Subsequently Swanson was elected by the Virginia
         Legislature to complete the unfinished term. After the change
         in the Virginia Constitution, he was re-elected by popular
         vote for three terms, serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee
         and the Naval Affairs Committee. His service in the Senate
         continued from 1910 until 1933, when he became Secretary of
         the Navy under President Franklin D. Roosevelt and was
         instrumental in building a modern U.S. Navy. For a more
         complete discussion of his political career and
         accomplishments see 
         <bibref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href=""><title xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Claude A. Swanson of Virginia: A Political
            Biography</title></bibref>by Henry C. Ferrell, Jr. (1985, University Press of
         Kentucky).</p>
      <p>He married 
         <persname>Elizabeth Deane Lyons</persname>("Lizzie"), on
         December 11, 1894, and following his term as governor, the
         Swansons lived on their farm "Eldon" east of 
         <geogname>Chatham, Virginia</geogname>, when the Senate was
         not in session, until her death on July 13, 1920. Swanson's
         second marriage, in October of 1923, was to 
         <persname>Lulie Lyons Hall</persname>, widow of Cunningham
         Hall of Richmond and sister of his first wife, Lizzie
         Lyons.</p>
      <p>The Swanson Papers are arranged chronologically with an
         alphabetical listing of subjects and the dates of their
         letters following in this guide (Boxes 1-10). Several topics
         of concern to numerous constituents have been foldered
         separately (Boxes 11-16) and include the following: the
         Armenian refugee problem and conflict with their Turkish
         rulers; disarmament letters discussing the first major attempt
         to reduce the burden of armaments at the Washington Naval
         Conference of 1921-1922; letters concerned with the affairs of
         the 
         <geogname>Hampton Roads</geogname>Area, including 
         <geogname>Norfolk</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Newport News</geogname>, 
         <geogname>Hampton</geogname>, and 
         <geogname>Portsmouth</geogname>, chiefly reflecting the vast
         impact that World War I and the presence of the armed forces
         had on the area; Naval Appointments; Prohibition and related
         topics; Requests by Constituents, which includes mostly simple
         requests for government publications, seeds, plants, fish
         applications, Senate gallery passes, White House tours, and
         tickets to various events; 
         <geogname>Richmond</geogname>affairs; Second Class Mail Rates,
         a bill introduced to repeal the zone postal law applying to
         second class mail matter, viewed as harmful to small local
         newspapers and beneficial to the big magazines; the
         Sheppard-Towner Bill, which gave funds to states to promote
         maternal and infant welfare; the Soldier's Bonus Bill, which
         sought to compensate soldiers who served in the armed forces
         during World War I while their contemporaries earned high
         wages back home; and Tariffs and Taxes, chiefly concerned with
         the perceived impact of the Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act upon
         various American industries and businesses.</p>
