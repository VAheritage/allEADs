         <p>The collection consists of letters to the writer Lloyd
         Frankenberg and his wife, the painter, Loren MacIver. Topics
         include Marion Cummings' health, a Guggenheim fellowship,
         cummings' art, and life at Silver Lake (N.H.). One letter
         contains nonsensical references to "The Enormous Room" and
         Joseph F. Gould.</p>
         <p>With the letters is a catalog for an exhibition of
         paintings by E.E. Cummings at the American British Art Center,
         N.Y.</p>

                  <p>Thanks her for sending garlic to them in New
                  Hampshire and describes her natural surroundings,
                  "Our mountains are still beautiful &amp; though the
                  flowers are almost gone &amp; the birds are migrating
                  we still have deer. At noon today, I happened to look
                  out the window &amp; there about 50 feet away in the
                  bright sunlight &amp; standing in tall grass was a
                  beautiful buck. Cummings was even nearer to him
                  though obscured by some bushes, and was writing in
                  his notebook."</p>
