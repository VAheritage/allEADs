      <p>The collection consists of letters to the writer Lloyd
         Frankenberg and his wife, the painter, Loren MacIver. Topics
         include Marion Cummings' health, a Guggenheim fellowship,
         cummings' art, and life at Silver Lake (N.H.). One letter
         contains nonsensical references to "The Enormous Room" and
         Joseph F. Gould.</p>
      <p>With the letters is a catalog for an exhibition of
         paintings by E.E. Cummings at the American British Art Center,
         N.Y.</p>
