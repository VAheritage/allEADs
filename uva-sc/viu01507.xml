         <p>Edward Pollard was born at "Alta Vista," Albemarle County,
         Virginia, to Richard and Paulina Cabell Rives; he attended
         Hampden-Sydney College (ca. 1846) and the University of
         Virginia, 1847-1849. He was a clerk for the judiciary
         committee of the House of Representatives, 1857-1861, and
         during the Civil War he was the editor of the 
         <title render="italic">Daily Richmond Examiner</title>,
         1861-1867.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection consists of four letters, 1856-1857, from
         Virginia journalist, Edward Alfred Pollard (1831-1872) and his
         mother, Paulina Pollard, concerning their financial
         difficulties.</p>
         <p>The letters include one from Paulina Pollard asking for an
         eighty dollar advance on the interest from her fund due in
         February (1856 Nov 17); and three letters from Edward Pollard
         to C[harles ?] Mitchell about a debt owed by Pollard to
         Mitchell. In the first letter, Pollard begs for a small loan
         to enable him to leave [New York City ?] where he had a
         "personal difficulty at the St. Nicholas; was arrested and
         fined $10 and was furthermore ordered to give bail in three
         hundred dollars for the peace." He implored Mitchell to loan
         him enough money to leave the city and travel to Washington,
         D.C., that being the condition laid down by the proprietor of
         Cozzen's Hotel on Canal Street and Broadway for paying his
         bail and avoiding imprisonment (1857 Jul 5); the second letter
         promises to pay the debt when he draws his salary on the first
         and asks that he not acquaint his mother with the
         circumstances of the loan (1857 July 23); and the last letter
         answers Mitchell's request for the "immediate remittance of a
         fifteen dollar debt" and his explanation about why he had not
         paid the amount earlier (1857 Sep 17).</p>
