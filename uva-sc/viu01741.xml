      <p>This twenty page manuscript, post 1864, entitled "Maps of
         Battle-Fields where the 36th Regt. Wis. Vols. was engaged,"
         contains maps and commentaries on the regiment's movements
         during various battles in Virginia in 1864. (Its author, the
         great-grandfather of one of the donors, appears to have been
         other than a combat soldier, probably a hospital orderly or
         ambulance driver, for he makes several references to surgeons
         and depicts their positions and those of hospitals and
         ambulances on the maps.) Various natural features such as
         rivers and woods are indicated, especially the more prominent
         ones of Malvern Hill, Strawberry Plains, and the James River.
         Roads, hospitals, pontoons, gunboats, batteries, corn and
         sugar cane fields, breastworks, the Jones House (Totopotomoy),
         a church and a schoolhouse are among the man-made features
         illustrated. A scale of miles is provided for each map.</p>
      <p>The Thirty-sixth was organized at Camp Randall in Madison
         and was mustered into United States service as a volunteer
         regiment of infantry on March 23, 1864. Upon arriving at
         Spotsylvania Court House, Virginia it was assigned to the
         First [Alexander Stewart Webb's] Brigade, Second [John
         Gibbon's] Division II Army Corps, Army of the Potomac.</p>
      <p>Maps in this manuscript illustrate battles and skirmishes
         at North Anna River (May 23-27, 1864), Totopotomoy Creek (May
         30-June 1, 1864), Deep Bottom Run (July 28-August 14), and
         Reams' Station (August 24- 25). Although lacking a map, there
         is brief mention of the regiment's activities at Cold Harbor
         (June 2-3, 1864).</p>
      <p>The regiment's activities at Reams' Station are described
         at length and the author also comments on the capture of the
         regiment's flag and the Rebel "yell." He makes several
         disparaging observations about surgeons and describes them as
         either fleeing from the enemy, remaining in the rear,
         constantly calling for supper, or refusing to treat the
         wounded. Surgeons Hand (captured after the battle and later
         died in prison at Salisbury, North Carolina, on November 19,
         1864), Miller (died December 20, 1864 at his home), Assistant
         Surgeon G. D. Winch, and Woodward are mentioned by name. Other
         individuals mentioned during this and other battles include:
         Adjutant B. D. Atrvell(?), Orderly Sergeant Greely (Company
         E), Major William H. Hamilton, General Winfield Scott Hancock,
         Colonel Frank A. Haskell, Lieutenant William Lamberton
         (Company B), Captain Lindly and Colonel Clement E. Warner.</p>
      <p>Prior to the battle at Ream's Station this regiment
         consisted of 175 enlisted men (having suffered heavy
         casualties in previous battles) but after the battle's
         conclusion only forty-seven men were present out of an
         original roster of over nine hundred. According to William F.
         Fox's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Regimental Losses In The American Civil
         War,</title>the Thirty-sixth Wisconsin ranks seventeenth on
         the list of Union regiments having the highest percentages of
         men killed in action.</p>
