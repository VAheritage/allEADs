      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of seventy-four letters, August
         1841 through November 1846, written by John S. Miller, a
         merchant from Winchester, Virginia, to his sweetheart, Jane F.
         Schmidt from York, Pennsylvania, who became his wife during
         December 1843. Miller supplies a lot of detail about every day
         life in Winchester, Virginia, and Strasburg, Virginia, both
         personal and social. A typed transcript is provided for
         thirty- four of the letters, most of them for the years 1845
         and 1846. These letters were written during their courtship
         and while Jane was staying in York with her family waiting for
         the birth of their first child.</p>
      <p>Miller describes himself as "attached to the military"
         while mentioning a grand military ball to be held in
         Winchester (1841 August 31); mentions the visit of several
         volunteer companies to Winchester on September 11th and their
         review by General Carson, followed by a sumptuous dinner which
         was accompanied by patriotic speeches and songs (1841
         September 20); discusses his receipt of a letter impugning her
         character, which he believes written by his rival in York
         (1841 October 10 &amp; 24); describes an unusual wedding party
         in Winchester (1841 Dec 1); and notes increased conversions
         among the different congregations for the last two months
         (1841 Dec 20).</p>
      <p>Miller describes another military and civic ball and a
         march and sermon against intemperance in Winchester (1842 Mar
         1); since he was involved in the training of officers, he must
         go with his company to the encampment at Baltimore, Maryland
         (1842 May 1); refers to reading about a balloon ascension in
         York, Pennsylvania (1842 Aug 9); gives his opinion about the
         Millerites, who have been preaching in York (1843 Feb 15);
         describes a flood of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers,
         reveals that the couple is now engaged and that he is in
         business for himself, and shares his future prospects (1843
         Apr 19).</p>
      <p>He also describes a regimental parade in town and being off
         for a few days of military duty (1843 May 25); mentions the
         death of General Spangler and his happiness that Jane has
         joined the Lutheran Church (1843 Jun); the town of Winchester
         excited about recent lectures on Mesmerism (1843 Oct 12); and
         the date of their wedding set for Christmas (1843 Dec 12).</p>
      <p>There is only a single letter for 1844, written on November
         21, while Jane is visiting York, Pennsylvania. Miller
         describes a brawl in Winchester between the Whigs and the
         Democrats over the election, the stabbing death of a Mr. Light
         by Robert Baker, a deputy sheriff, over politics, and mentions
         David and Solon Henkel.</p>
      <p>The next group begins with July 1, 1845, covering the time
         when Jane was in York recovering from problems with her back
         and other health issues. Miller discusses his plans to buy a
         storehouse and move his business to Stasburg (1845 Sep 11
         &amp; 28); mentions Uncle Henkel's medical advice for his wife
         and two local scandals involving obscene behavior, one about a
         lawyer and the other involving a Methodist preacher (1845
         August 7). Many letters during the summer of 1845 discuss his
         distress at his wife's absence in York.</p>
      <p>Other topics include the death of John Miller's father
         (1845 Oct 5); the Mexican War (1846 Jun 2); the birth of their
         daughter, Mary Frances Miller, in York (1846 Aug 3, 10 &amp;
         26); and his inability to purchase a house from Mr. Grove in
         Strasburg, while describing another possibility (1846 Aug
         10).</p>
      <p>The remainder of the letters continue to discuss many
         detailed arrangements for setting up housekeeping in Strasburg
         when Jane returns home with their daughter in November 1846
         (Sep 17 &amp; 28; Oct 7; Nov 3 &amp; 7). These include
         decisions about hiring help for the house and to care for the
         baby, and whether to hire a slave or free woman. In one
         letter, September 28, 1846, John Miller writes, "would it not
         be best for me to bring a girl along with me to take charge of
         Sis on the road home if you think so I will try and get one,
         she must be a free one as a slave cannot be taken to your
         state."</p>
