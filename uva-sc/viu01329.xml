            <lb/>This collection centers around the incomplete memoirs of
         Francis H. (Frank) Schell (1834-1909), a special war artist
         for 
         <title render="italic">Frank Leslie's Illustrated
         Newspaper</title>, one of two illustrated national weekly
         newspapers published during the Civil War. These memoirs,
         edited by Sue Rainey, were published as Francis H. Schell,
         "Recollections of a Leslie's Special Artist in the Civil War:
         No. 1 Baltimore in 1861 Generals Butler and Banks and the
         Baffled Insurrectionists," 
         <title render="italic">Imprint: Journal of the American
         Historical Print Collectors Society</title>vol. 23, no. 1
         (Spring 1998): 18-26. A copy of this article is included with
         the collection.</p>
         <p>Schell describes the response in New York City to the
         Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter, his hiring by Frank
         Leslie (1834-1900), his journey to Baltimore via Annapolis,
         the mood of the city and its Confederate sentiment, its
         occupation by Massachusetts militia under the command of
         General Benjamin F. Butler and the seizure of arms and
         ammunition secreted by secessionists, a parade by firemen
         enlisting in a Union regiment, the arrest of police marshal
         George P. Kane and the board of police commissioners, the
         subsequent furor over presidential denial of habeas corpus,
         the arrival of additional Union troops, and comments by and
         about Butler.</p>
         <p>Schell arrived in the city a month after the Baltimore
         Riots (April 19, 1861) which had occurred because of the
         arrival by rail of the 6th Massachusetts Militia en route to
         defend Washington, D.C. As the troops marched across town to a
         connecting train, an anti-Unionist mob attacked them; the 6th
         responded with gunfire which lead to the deaths of four
         soldiers and twelve civilians as the troops boarded their
         train. A month later (May 13, 1861), General Butler returned
         to Baltimore with the 6th Massachusetts and the city remained
         under military occupation for the remainder of the war.
         Schell's memoir records the aura of tenseness in the city and
         feelings of patriotism between Unionists and outrage among
         Confederate sympathizers. Schell claimed the timely arrival of
         Butler's 8th Massachusetts militia regiment had thwarted the
         capture or burning of the USS 
         <title render="italic">Constitution</title>(Old Ironsides) by
         secessionists. He also praised the Sunday worship services and
         singing by the 19th Pennsylvania Infantry.</p>
         <p>Schell recounts conversations with, describes the
         activities of or makes reference to several prominent persons:
         Edmund Ruffin (1794-1865), a Virginia secessionist and
         agriculturalist; William H. Seward (1801- 1872), Secretary of
         State; Colonel (later brigadier general) Calvin Edward Pratt
         (1828-1896), commander of the 20th ("the Ulster County
         Regiment") and 31st New York militias; regiments; Brigadier
         General John E. Wool (1784- 1869); Brigadier General Benjamin
         F. Butler (1818-1893), commander of the Department of
         Annapolis (including Baltimore); General Winfield Scott
         (1786-1866); Simon Cameron (1799-1889), Secretary of War;
         Brigadier General George Cadwalader (1806-1879), Butler's
         successor as commander of the Department of Annapolis; Major
         General Nathaniel P. Banks (1816- 1894), commander of a
         division in and later head of the Department of Annapolis (he
         succeeded Cadwalader); George P. Kane, the marshal of
         Baltimore police whom Butler later arrested on charges of
         treason and conspiracy with secessionists; Supreme Court Chief
         Justice Roger B. Taney (1777-1864), and President Abraham
         Lincoln (1809-1865).</p>
