      <p>This collection consists of manuscripts and bound volumes,
         ca. 1808-1945, ca. 2,125 items (9 Hollinger boxes, ca. 4
         linear feet) pertaining to five major different residents or
         families of Shepherdstown, Virginia (now West Virginia),
         including sermons, ledgers, personal and business
         correspondence, accounts, receipts, and diaries, of merchant
         James Markell (d. 1872), the Reverend John T. Hargrave,
         Presbyterian circuit rider, the Swearingen family, and the
         medical practice of Dr. John Briscoe (died 1835) and Dr. John
         Quigley (born 1802). Briscoe treated many of the area slaves
         as his ledgers contain numerous references to them; his
         practice was taken over by Dr. John Quigley in 1835.</p>
      <p>The material is grouped alphabetically by the name of the
         person it chiefly concerns except for the bound volumes which
         are all placed at the end of the collection in Boxes 7-9. The
         first group of papers is the nine letters, 1834-1838, of
         Milton J. Brown, Constable at Shepherdstown, which discuss the
         advantages and attractions of the West (1834 Dec 16) and the
         collection of debts for others.</p>
      <p>A large group of material consisting of correspondence,
         accounts and receipts, and sermons, pertains to the Reverend
         John T. Hargrave, a Presbyterian circuit rider, Shepherdstown,
         Jefferson County. Accounts and receipts concerning slavery or
         African-Americans include: tax receipts for 1836, 1837, 1839
         &amp; 1841; a mention of a "colored woman Peggy" (1849 Nov
         28); and the hire of Ben (1839). Other accounts or receipts
         concerning education include: teacher's fee (1849 Jul 11) and
         Newark Academy fees for his sons, John &amp; William (1850 Jan
         16).</p>
      <p>Topics in Hargrave's correspondence include the following:
         a description of a religious revival in New Haven [Connecticut
         ?] (1820 Sep 7); the attempts of Hargrave, the executor for
         the estate of the Rev. W.C. Walton, to help L.M. Walton, hire
         out the slaves, George and Ben (1837 Feb 10); the work of
         Hargrave and the condition of the churches at Middleburg,
         Loudoun County, and at Shepherdstown (1853 Jan 20; Apr 18, Jul
         18; and n.d.); the loss of the vessel 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Arctic</title>(1854 Oct 13);
         questions concerning the Revolutionary War service of Captain
         Alexander Rose (1856 Sep 9); and the move of his son, William
         Hargrave, to Bastrop, Bastrop County, Texas, [ca. 1855 ?] to
         practice law, and the attractiveness of raising cattle there
         (1855 Jan 24, Mar 12, &amp; n.d.).</p>
      <p>The sermons of John T. Hargrave, 1829-1856, and undated,
         usually have the dates and places of delivery on the reverse,
         and are filed chronologically by the earliest year in which
         they were delivered. Undated sermons are grouped by whether
         they are topical or consist of scriptural exposition.
         Hargrave's circuit included Middleburg, Aldie, Lynchburg, and
         the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
      <p>Another large group of material pertains to James Markell,
         a merchant of Shepherdstown, Jefferson County, Virginia, whose
         earliest correspondence, ca. 1826-1833, from family and
         friends dates from his stay in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with
         merchant John Newton Lane, learning the mercantile trade.
         Family members include sisters Betsy and Lydia A. Markell, and
         his brothers, John and Daniel. From 1835-1836, Markell worked
         in Shepherdstown for Messrs. John N. Lane and Willoughby L.
         Webb, who later became a partner in business with Markell
         under the name Webb &amp; Markell, ca. 1840-1848, until they
         dissolved their partnership late in 1848. He apparently went
         into business with Mr. [L.C. Heskitt ?] in 1851. Most of the
         correspondence after 1840 concerns business and financial
         matters.</p>
      <p>Correspondence of Markell pertaining to slavery includes:
         hiring of slaves (1846 Nov 13; 1853 Mar 1, May 10, &amp; Dec
         26; 1855 Sep 13; 1857 Feb 19; 1861 Mar 16; and several
         undated); the possible purchase of a Negro woman from
         Hagerstown (1840 Apr 9); the sale of a woman and her children
         belonging to Markell (1855 Jan 3; 1857 Jan 24, Dec 23); the
         purchase of a slave (1841 [?] 29; 1842 Mar 8); and the sale or
         hire of estate slaves by R. B. Semple (1846 Nov 13; 1852 Dec
         24; 1853 Feb 28; 1854 May 3; and undated).</p>

         election of Andrew Jackson as President (1828 Dec 11); a
         planned trip to Washington to see Jackson's inauguration (1829
         Feb 25); local excitement in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania,
         including a runaway stage, the burning in effigy of the
         anti-Masonic candidate for Congress, and the killing of a

         Joseph Van Swearingen on January 20, 1831, Dr. Quigley in

         at Shepherdstown (1833 Aug 14); a description of a robbery
         attempt at a store in Hanover, York County, Pennsylvania, and
         the dissatisfaction towards General Jackson in this part of
         Pennsylvania (1834 Jan 17); the marriage of James Markell to
         Elizabeth S. (1839 Nov 9); H.J. Foster, teacher at the
         Academy, New London, Campbell County, Virginia, his health and
         the school (1847 Sep 25, Nov 9; 1848 Jan 24; for additional
         Foster correspondence see the folder with Kate Van Doren
         correspondence in Box 6); and the insurance and arrangements
         for the "[Woolen ?] Factory" of Webb &amp; Markell at
         Shepherdstown (1847 Oct; 1848 Sep 12; 1849 Mar 5, Apr 17; 1852
         Jan 12, Mar 3; 1853 Mar 18).</p>
      <p>Other topics include: the uproar in the congregation of the
         Presbyterian Church in New London, Campbell County, Virginia,
         over the marriage of their minister to an older woman (1848
         Jan 24); the termination of the partnership between Webb and
         Markell (1848 Nov 1, 22, &amp; 28); the financial affairs of
         artist Alexander Robinson Boteler (1815-1892), who was also an
         United States and Confederate congressman (1849 Apr 17; 1852
         Apr 21; 1853 Oct 25, Nov 1, 21; 1854 Apr 18, Jul 3, Nov 10;
         1856 Jan 9; [1867?]; and undated); a severe snow storm at
         Warrenton, Virginia (1857 Jan 24); the potential of a tobacco

         Canal's slip of land near Shepherdstown for a coal and
         lumberyard (1851 Apr 12); women rejoice in their financial

         Maryland (1852 Dec 31); the decision of A.C. Heaton to leave

         Markell, brother of James Markell (1856 Jul 2; 1857 Mar
         22).</p>
      <p>Additional subjects in Markell's correspondence include:
         letters from Markell's servant, Lydia Baker [slave hire ?]
         (1856 Dec 27; 1857 Dec 30); the death of Mary [Mason ?] (1858
         Mar 1); advice from Willoughby L. Webb to Markell on
         re-entering the mercantile business (1860 Mar 22); the effect
         of the threat of secession by the South on business, "Whether
         they will carry out their hastily made up resolutions, and
         secede or not, one thing the fuss they have made and are
         making is playing the mischief with money matters and of
         consequence a stagnation in trade. And if continued will break
         up a number of merchants who would get along if it were not
         for this excitement. I do not pretend to know much about what
         effect, a dissolution of the Union would have on us here on
         the line, as it were between the two belligerents, one thing I
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">think</title>, however, that neither
         the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">North</title>or the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">South</title>will be benefitted." (1860
         Nov 13) and "I know very well, however, that for Maryland and
         Virginia to be connected with South Carolina and other cotton
         states in a Southern Confederacy would result very disastrous
         to the agricultural portion of the commissions, or in other
         words interest." (1861 Feb 7).</p>
      <p>Other topics include: a reference to a recommendation
         supporting Markell's application for a job with the Post
         Office which stressed that Markell had no sympathy with the
         doctrine of secession and mentions the postponement of the

         Thomas B. Davis, 2nd Virginia Cavalry, Fitz Lee's Division,

         request by Almira Markell to her father to allow her to give
         up her geography class because she felt harassed for being a
         Southerner (1868 Jan 27).</p>
      <p>Markell family accounts and receipts pertaining to slavery
         or African-Americans include: slave sales (1838 Nov 8; 1840
         Oct 13; 1849 Feb 1); expenses incurred in transporting the
         Negroes of James H. Swearingen from Shepherdstown to Fort
         Osage, Missouri (1843 Apr 29); the purchase of Gabriel (1843
