      <head>History of Barrett Day Care Center</head>
      <p>The 
         <corpname>Barrett Day Care Center</corpname>, formerly the 
         <corpname>Janie Porter Barrett Day Nursery</corpname>, is the
         oldest day care center in the State of 
         <geogname>Virginia</geogname>. It was organized in the fall of
         1935 by 
         <persname>Daisy V. Green</persname>, a registered nurse of
         Petersburg, Virginia and former employee of the
         Charlottesville City Health Department; it was supported by
         the 
         <corpname>Works Project Administration of the Education
         Department</corpname>. The Nursery was originally located in a
         building owned by Courtney D. Goodloe at 126 4th Street, N. W.
         This small facility served as the Nursery's home until August
         1940 when it closed upon Mrs. Greene's departure. During these
         early years, many friends made donations, and the children
         were admitted free of charge.</p>
      <p>In January 1941 the Nursery re-opened under the same name
         and still under the support of the Works Project
         Administration. A December 23, 1942 letter from Mrs. 
         <persname>Frances Cromwell</persname>, 
         <corpname>State Supervisor of the Child Protection
         Program</corpname>, stated that by order of the President of
         the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, all W. P. A.
         projects would be liquidated as of January 16, 1943. On
         December 31, 1942, 
         <persname>Douglas Edwards</persname>and 
         <persname>Otelia L. Jackson</persname>, members of the
         Nursery, along with members of the 
         <corpname>Belmont Day Nursery</corpname>, met with the 
         <corpname>Charlottesville City School Board</corpname>. Board
         members of both nurseries were in favor of continuing the
         Janie Porter Barrett Day Nursery and closing the Belmont Day
         Nursery. Following this meeting, during which the School Board
         informed the Nursery that it was not its sponsor, an appeal
         was made directly to the State. This advisory committee
         succeeded in getting the Department of Public Welfare to
         sponsor the program. This could be done under the provisions
         of the State Child Care Committee appointed the previous fall,
         if the program was classified as "day nursery" rather than
         "nursery school." On January 13, 1943, the Nursery was given
         permission to continue. Responses from volunteers and local
         organizations were good. The 
         <corpname>Child Welfare Association</corpname>paid salaries of
         teachers following the first month when teachers had given
         their service free. Rent had also been donated that first
         month. The Nursery continued operation through 1943 without
         interruption under the supervision of a group of
         Charlottesville citizens with funds raised entirely in 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>. In becoming a day
         nursery, it had extended its services by taking care of
         children for ten hours rather than only from nine to three; it
         also took the five-to-six-year-olds who had been excluded
         under the former plan. The Nursery struggled to maintain its
         existence until the organization of the 
         <corpname>Community Chest</corpname>and its acceptance of the
         Nursery as one of its agencies.</p>
      <p>There was a regular tuition charge of one dollar a week per
         child. A plan was worked out whereby the mother and the
         employer were asked to share this tuition as each benefitted
         from the care of the child. Response from employers was
         chiefly favorable. A few mothers paid the entire tuition
         themselves. A few others were unable to pay any because of
         financial obligations. For such cases, there was a scholarship
         committee which investigated the case; and, on the basis of
         their recommendation, whole or partial scholarships were
         granted.</p>
      <p>In addition to tuition fees, the Board of the Nursery
         sought other sources of income. It was granted an
         appropriation of seventy-five dollars per month by the City
         Council, which was given as an increased appropriation to the 
         <corpname>Department of Public Welfare</corpname>, the
         official sponsor of the Nursery. The local Child Welfare
         Association was the next largest contributor with $700 per
         year. There were also individual and group contributions.</p>
      <p>Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, the Nursery inhabited
         several locations until moving to its present location of 410
         Ridge Street in the late 1950s. During its first few years,
         the Nursery lacked the requirements to meet the needs of the
         community, such as not having an outdoor play area or the
         services of a trained director. From July 1950 until July
         1951, the Nursery secured the services of Miss 
         <persname>Velma Branch</persname>, a graduate of Hampton
         Institute and College with a year's experience in the Nursery
         School at Hampton Institute. The board members and staff
         gained valuable information on the needs and management of a
         nursery school from Miss Branch, and used this knowledge to
         the Nursery's best advantage. Immediately prior to Miss
         Branch's resignation there had been a reduction of the budget
         by the Community Chest.</p>
      <p>During the 1960s, the Janie Porter Barrett Day Nursery
         moved from the sponsorship of the Community Chest to the
         sponsorship of the 
         <corpname>United Givers Fund</corpname>. It continued to grow
         under their sponsorship. In the 1960s, the Nursery provided a
         unique service to 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>and 
         <geogname>Albemarle County</geogname>as the only day-care
         center for children in the community. It provided day care for
         children of low-income families thereby enabling parents to
         hold full-time jobs, thus increasing the family's income and
         keeping it off welfare. The community also benefitted from the
         productivity of these families and the availability of
         additional workers for its businesses, industries, and
         personal services.</p>
      <p>Present day management of the Nursery by a Board of
         Directors came into existence during this time. The Board of
         Directors consists of citizens from all areas of the community
         with an interest in pre-school children and who demonstrate
         leadership qualities. The Board determines the policies of the
         Nursery and supervises its finances. The Nursery program is
         based upon standards established by the 
         <corpname>Virginia Department of Welfare and
         Institutions</corpname>for day-care centers.</p>
      <p>During the 1960s, about 70% of the Nursery's operating
         expenses were provided through the 
         <corpname>United Givers Fund</corpname>. Most of the other 30%
         came from tuition fees paid by parents. There were also
         surplus food items and gifts of services from a local business
         and physician. Tuition was paid by the parents of all children
         in the Nursery. Fees charged were based on the income of the
         family and the number of independent children with a minimum
         of $2.50 and a maximum of $8.50 per child per week. A small
         scholarship fund was available to assist families of children
         who may have become financially distressed through loss of
         job, loss of a parent, or extended illness.</p>
      <p>The building located at 410 Ridge Street in which the
         Barrett Day Care Center operates was owned and operated by the
         United Givers Fund throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The
         building was deeded to the 
         <corpname>Barrett Day Care Center, Inc.</corpname>in 1977 by
         the United Givers Fund, now the 
         <corpname>United Way</corpname>, with the stipulation that it
         be used as a day care center. As of 1989, the Day Care Center
         operated solely on donations and tuition fees and was the only
         non-profit day care center in 
         <geogname>Charlottesville</geogname>that did not have an
         underwriting sponsor to help pay for such expenses as utility
         or maintenance costs. Donations were not as strong as they
         needed to be; and, although United Way assisted ten children
         at the center with scholarships, there was still a waiting
         list for children whose families needed financial assistance
         for tuition. Working with the Board of Directors of the Day
         Care Center and a representative of the 
         <corpname>Monticello Area Community Action Agency</corpname>,
         the center's director, 
         <persname>Cynthia Stratton</persname>, helped to set up a
         committee of individuals to raise the money necessary for the
         most pressing needs at the center and to continue the
         operation of the Barrett Day Care Center. Within two months,
         donations from Charlottesville-area businesses and individuals
         helped push a state-mandated project through at the center.
         They also boosted revenue for refurbishing the
         seventy-two-year-old building at 410 Ridge Street.</p>
      <p>The Nursery is licensed by the 
         <corpname>Department of Public Welfare</corpname>(formerly the
         <corpname>Department of Welfare and Institutions</corpname>)
         of the Commonwealth of Virginia. This license certifies that
         the Nursery meets health and safety regulations, has adequate
         space and equipment, has sufficient staff, and conducts a
         program that is beneficial to the age children admitted to the
         Nursery. In the past, the Nursery was a participating agency
         of the 
         <corpname>United Givers Fund of Charlottesville and Albemarle,
         Inc.</corpname>It was also a member of the 
         <corpname>National Committee for the Day Care of Children,
         Inc.</corpname>, a non-profit agency which promoted adequate
         day-care centers and good standards for centers and which
         disseminated information in this field.</p>
