      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of 31 letters, 1919-1962, from
         James Branch Cabell to Mr. Ashfield, Vincent Starrett, Deems
         Taylor, and Louis Untermeyer. The letter from Cabell to
         Ashfield, January 2, 1920, thanks him for expressing his
         appreciation for 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Jurgen</title>and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Cream of the Jest</title>and
         expresses his regrets that his books stay inaccessible in
         public libraries.</p>
      <p>There are six letters from James Branch Cabell to Vincent
         Starrett, 1925-1956, expressing thanks for his gift of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Coffins for Two</title>(1925 Mar 12);
         admiration for "the continuous verve of your verses" and
         states "without belittling your fine sonnet Birthday, the man
         has not ever excelled that unversified true poem which he
         published virtually during his nonage, and in fact as far back
         as in 1946, about being sixty years old. In my Bibliography of
         Stephen Crane I have preserved that article as perfect" (1949
         May 14); gives him permission to use any of his letters "as
         may seem acceptable, upon the sole condition that in due
         course I am to receive a copy of your book properly
         autographed by its gifted author"... and promises "well in
         advance to weep over those pages which may commemorate the
         literary Chicago of thirty years ago and the flamboyant times
         which we remember" (1950 Oct 5).</p>
      <p>Cabell encloses an inscription for the 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Jurgen,</title>illustrated by Frank C.
         Pape, whose text contains "a number of mildly irritating
         errors," belonging to Vincent Starrett. The inscription reads
         "who some thirty years ago wrote well-nigh the first of my
         innumerous obituaries has been inscribed, with a large deal of
         ancient but inveterate friendship, that which was then, and
         which still remains, his personal choice for my monument"
         (1952 Apr 29); and Cabell inquires about how to procure
         Starrett's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Autobiography</title>published in 1953,
         which he missed due to continual illness which lasted into
         1954 and 1955 (1956 Apr 10).</p>
      <p>Correspondence between James Branch Cabell and the
         composer, Deems Taylor (1885-1966), discuss Taylor's desire to
         collaborate with Cabell, using 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Jurgen</title>as the basis for a
         libretto or musical drama, a book which Taylor praised in an
         earlier letter (1920 Dec 29). Taylor spells out the reason why
         he believes that Cabell would be able to compose such a work,
         "You write the most beautiful English prose that I know. The
         only moderns who can touch it, in my opinion, are Wilde and
         Masefield; but Wilde's too sweetish, and Masefield is just a
         bit grandiose. Your feeling for form is exactly that of music
         drama. Take 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Jurgen</title>, for instance. Most of
         it is in dialogue, in the first place. Then the action is
         leisurely, falls naturally into scenes, and still isn't
         cluttered up with plot. It stands on its own legs as
         narrative, even with all the allegory left out. And above all,
         it's medieval in setting" (1921 Jan 5).</p>
      <p>In response to Cabell's guarded interest and questions
         about what constitutes a good musical drama (1921 Jan 10),
         Taylor sends five libretti (not present) for Cabell to glance
         through and writes a long and detailed analysis describing the
         traits that should characterize a good libretto (1921 Jan 22).
         Cabell grants Taylor permission to compose a libretto based
         upon his book, "Nothing could please me more than to have you
         do a 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Jurgen</title>suite" (1921 Mar 12)
         which was apparently a success (1925 Nov 21). There are also
         two letters to Deems Taylor, from Harcourt, Brace &amp; World,
         Inc. seeking permission to use his letters to Cabell in the
         book 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Between Friends: Letters of James
         Branch Cabell and Others</title>(1961 Oct 17 &amp; 1962 Mar
         14).</p>
      <p>Also present in this collection is a long series of
         fourteen typed letters, 1919-1957, most with envelopes, from
         James Branch Cabell to Louis Untermeyer, and two bookplates
         belonging to Cabell. Topics include: both praise and thanks
         for Untermeyer's books 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Modern American Poetry: An
         Introduction</title>(1919 Dec 29), and 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Including Horace,</title>with
         Untermeyer's kind inscription to Cabell on its fly-leaf (1919
         Dec 20); giving permission to Untermeyer to use "Sea-Scapes"
         which he wrote in 1896, saying "save for the Villon ballade on
         page 71 none of the verses are paraphrases or adaptations. All
         of my 'sources' are pure fiction, except for the line lifted
         from Petronius, which I lighted on long after the verses now
         thereunder were written" (1920 Sep 8); and mention of the
         publication of Cabell's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Cords of Vanity</title>and the
         imminent 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Domnei,</title>and congratulations on
         the publication of 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The New Adam</title>by Untermeyer,
         whose verses were so lovely that Cabell feared "after writing
         them, you cannot but enter with discomposing condescension in
         to my 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Hidden Way [From the Hidden Way Being
         Seventy- five Adaptations in Verse]</title>" (1920 Sep
         22).</p>
      <p>Other subjects include: thanks for 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Poems of the Dance</title>and his
         pleasure at the beauty of the English 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Jurgen,</title>which "delighted me with
         the wellnigh forgotten sensation of seeing a book by me in
         satisfactory type and binding" (1921 Nov 30); arrangements to
         meet Untermeyer in New York later in January and changes in
         two of his books (1922 Jan 3); appreciation for Untermeyer's
         introduction to 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Gallantry</title>(1922 Mar 2); high
         praise for Untermeyer's 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Heavens,</title>"It really seems to me
         for sheer damnable cleverness without any parallel that I know
         of. I think that my admiration for you as a poet is adequate,
         I know that it is large and cordial. But at parody you really
         appear to have a supreme and probably unique genius, and I am
         tolerably sure too that the very best of your criticism is
         done in this form. 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Heavens</title>is the best volume of
         critical essays I have seem since I don't know when" (1922 Mar
         25); and gives permission to Untermeyer to use his comments
         concerning 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Heavens</title>in any way he wants and
         suggests several minor corrections relative to 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Gallantry</title>in his paper (1922 Apr
         4).</p>
      <p>Additional topics in these letters include: his delight
         with 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Forms of Poetry</title>and a
         question about the rule italicized under French Forms (1926
         May 28); his pleasure in 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Moses A Novel</title>which seems to
         Cabell to be his best work so far, "although it is with a
         certain personal grudging that I allow it precedence to 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Heavens</title>" (1928 Sep 19); asks
         Untermeyer to visit him during his trip to Richmond to meet
         some of the "local intelligentsia" (1932 Apr 12); expresses
         gratitude for his kind letter about his last book and sadness
         that it has been so many years since they had met (1955 Nov
         17); praises the anthology 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Treasury of Ribaldry,</title>all
         except for its type which was hard on the eyes but allowed
         Untermeyer to include "yet more naughtiness" (1957 Jan 8).</p>
