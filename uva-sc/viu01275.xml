      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 525 items, (1775-1859)1926,
         pertaining to the Holland and White families of Fluvanna
         County, Virginia. There are correspondence, business and legal
         papers, genealogical information, and printed material. The
         business papers of John C. Holland, Capt. John White, and
         James P. White form the majority of the collection and consist
         of 478 items.</p>
      <p>The correspondence, 1837-1859, consists of eighteen
         letters. A letter dated October 1840 to John C. Holland
         expresses the wishes of its writer to retain Holland's negroes
         for another year, relates that "Phill" was bitten by a snake,
         and discusses prices for "Phill," "Edmund," and "Elias" and
         the possibility of hiring more hands for the following year.
         In January 1841, John Bragg of Richmond, Virginia writes to
         John C. Holland about a dispute over a settlement involving
         wool and machines and offers to buy Mr. Shepherd's part of the
         machine. A letter, January 3, 1853, from Winchester, Kentucky,
         to John White, discusses family news, the high prices for
         stock, hogs, and mules, and the railroad being complete to the
         mouth of "Big Sandy." A letter, June 20, 1856, from G. R.
         Button in Oldham County, Kentucky to John White, relates some
         family news, that rain is needed for their crops of corn,
         oats, and wheat and that the drought is adversely affecting
         the horses and mules as well, and makes an offer to buy a
         negro woman with stock. There is a letter, October 2, 1856,
         from Jennie St[range], Sussex, Virginia, to Miss Willie
         [White] which discusses a big religious meeting during which
         numerous people made professions. There are four letters,
         1859, from Sallie T. Shepherd to Willie White, which discuss
         school life at Albemarle Female Institute in Charlottesville,
         Virginia, Fluvanna Female Institute, and Beaumont. Other
         topics mentioned in Miss Shepherd?s letters include comments
         on Willie White teaching school, the Jefferson Society of the
         University of Virginia, spring fashions, social activities,
         and a visit by preacher Cumberland George.</p>
      <p>The business papers, 1775-1926, consist of accounts,
         receipts, promissory notes, tax notices, and miscellaneous
         papers relating to business affairs. There are numerous
         accounts of John White for the purchase of calico, gingham,
         cotton, flannel, muslin, gloves, shoes, knitting needles,
         thread, and buttons as well as sugar, coffee, salt, and other
         staples and goods. There is a notice of a sale, March 25,
         1830, of Capt. Joshua Key's land. There are records of the
         overseers of the poor of Fluvanna County for June 27, 1831 and
         June 1, 1857. Missionary Society at Lyles Church records are
         dated 1832 and October 3, 1843. There is an October 26, 1836
         receipt for "one negro boy Albert appraised to eight hundred
         dollars..." Documents dated December 26, 1836, October 25,
         1837 and January 3, 1838 concern the estate of Pleasant White.
         There is a notice of sale, November 7, 1838, for the late
         residence of Susan Howard. There are various receipts for
         tuition for the children of the Holland and White families:
         paid by John White in 1838, 1839 and April 1842; paid by John
         C. Holland in January 1851 and 1858-1859; paid by James P.
         White in December 1856 and August 1858; and, paid by R. S.
         Holland in April and October 1859. There are two receipts,
         December 5, 1840 and June 17, 1843, concerning a carding
         machine, one re the profits and one re the cost of making
         rollers for the machine. There are tobacco (April 18, 1850 and
         July 18, 1852) and wheat accounts (August 29, 1850). Several
         documents relate to African-Americans: account for hauling
         slaves, November 26, 1852; account for "visit to negros,"
         January 1853; and, supplies for Sally [Sarah] Stone's slaves
         and amount paid W[illiam] A. Nicholson for removing slaves,
         1859. Receipts, 1852-1854, relate to John C. Holland,
         administrator for the estate of P[hilip] A. Holland. Five
         receipts dated November 27, 1856 relate to John C. Holland as
         attorney for the division of the dower and other property of
         Lucy Holland. A detailed medical account to James P. White,
         April 19, 1853, includes services for several women. There is
         also an account for dental work, March 7, 1855, from T. Wills
         to James P. White. Miscellaneous accounts include ones for
         making shoes and shoe repair (June 1853; April and September
         1859); blacksmithing (January 1859); and, wagons and
         accessories (June 10, 1869). There are two Civil War
         documents, January 13, 1865, received of John C. Holland for
         the Mounted Guard supplies under order allowing soldiers to
         purchase for their families. On April 27, 1874, there is a
         notification of petition presented by Nicholson against the
         estate of Sarah Stone. Two letters, January 25, 1893 and
         February 15, 1897, from William B. West Company, Wooden Ware
         and Fancy Groceries, in Richmond, Virginia, to Lucy M.
         Holland, concern a business agreement whereby Lucy Holland
         receives interest on a regular basis and any part or all of
         the principal with ten days' notice. A promise to pay Lucy M.
         Holland by William B. West and Mary C. West is dated January
         1, 1914. A notice, June 7, 1926, from M. C. Pitman, real
         estate and abstracts, to John B. White, pertains to lands in
         west Florida deeded by the St. Andrews Bay Railroad Land and
         Mining Company.</p>
      <p>The legal papers, 13 items, 1828-1858, deal chiefly with
         land transactions and estates. A certificate dated November 9,
         1829, appointing John White to Captain of the twelfth
         regiment, third brigade, second division of the Virginia
         Militia, is signed by William B[ranch] Giles (1762-1830),
         governor of Virginia. There is a deed of trust, March 8, 1830,
         executed by Joshua Key for land transfer for payment of debt
         to Freeman H. Woodruff. There are two documents, September 15,
         1830 and September 14, 1831, between Martin Strong and John
         White for the sale and purchase of land in Fluvanna County.
         There is a charter, August 25, 1831, for the Lyles Meeting
         House Missionary Society. Papers re the estate of Pleasant
         White are dated December 2, 1836 and April 28, 1842. There is
         a consent by the legatees of the estate of Lucy Holland for
         the sale and division of her estate, October 22, 1856. A few
         documents relating to transactions involving miscellaneous
         lands in Fluvanna County, Virginia are included.</p>
      <p>There is a memorandum book, 1857-1864, kept by James P.
         White, concerning miscellaneous financial matters, including
         records of lugs; amounts for the hire of men; tobacco, wheat,
         oat, and corn sales; and, oak sold to C. B. Perkins. There is
         a notation, March 22, 1858, regarding the sale of Sarah
         Stone's slaves, including a boy "Frank" and a girl "Matitcia."
         Other notations concern the amount received from William A.
         Nicholson for the hire of two men for thirty-three days; the
         amount received for keeping Lyles Church; pears plants; hogs
         killed in 1861; and, the amount of time Thomas Shepherd's

      <p>The genealogy material contains notes on the wills of
         members of the Parish, Perkins, Shepherd, Seay, Holland, and
         other families of Fluvanna County, Virginia. There is also a
         notebook containing notes on marriages recorded in Palmyra,
         Fluvanna County, Virginia and marriages recorded in Goochland
         County, Virginia.</p>

         of the personal property of A. Wakeham on April 28, 1892 and
         an advertisement for S. T. Beveridge &amp; Company of
         Richmond, Virginia dated October 11, 1907.</p>
