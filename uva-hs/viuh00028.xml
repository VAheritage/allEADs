      <p>A native of southwest Virginia, Dr. Claude Donald Moore was born in 1892 and died in 1991.
        He was a 1916 graduate of the medical school at the University of Virginia. Dr. Moore spent
        his childhood in Radford, Virginia, later moving to Roanoke where he attended high school.
        Upon his graduation in 1911, Moore took courses at Roanoke College, then crossed the Blue
        Ridge to Charlottesville where he enrolled at UVa in 1912. That fall, he joined the football
        team, against the advice of some of his professors, and successfully balanced academics,
        athletics, and a Pathology Department assistantship for the next four years. These
        accomplishments were a source of continuing pride to him, along with the 1915 season victory
        over Yale. </p>
      <p>Moore interned at the Cornell Medical Center. With U.S. involvement in World War One
        eminent, he enlisted in the medical corps and shipped out in the fall of 1918. For a year
        after the armistice of November 1918, Moore remained in the medical corps in France,
        attaining the rank of Captain. He returned to private practice in Roanoke in 1920. </p>
      <p>General medicine held Moore's interest for six years, but he began to feel the need for
        additional training. In 1926, the Mayo Clinic accepted him in its radiology program, and he
        became a specialist in that service. After the Mayo residency, he took the position of full
        professor and Radiology department head for the George Washington University Hospital in
        January 1930. Moore remained in the Washington, D.C. area for the rest of his professional
        career, eventually turning to private practice exclusively. He retired from medicine in
        1956. Moore shrewdly capitalized on the regional post-war development boom, and his
        investments in real estate west of Washington proved immensely lucrative. His philanthropic
        interests included a $300,000 gift to the University of Virginia Medical School for the
        library which bears his name. The Claude Moore Charitable Foundation continues to sponsor
        many worthy projects and has made a $12.5 million challenge gift to UVa's School of Medicine
        for a state-of-the-art medical education building. Additional genealogical information is in
        the Sarah Ellen Peterman Horton section of "The Peterman Family" by Marguerite Tise.</p>

          <p>Moore complains about his mother not writing enough and threatens to "marry me a French
            girl and make me a home over here." He hopes to go forward into the Zone of Advance
            rather than return to the States. He wants Kodak film which could not be found in Paris.
