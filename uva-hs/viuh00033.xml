               <p>Dr. Themla Brumfield Dunn and Dr. Janet Coleman Kimbrough were requested by Mrs.
                  Ferrell of the Medical Alumni Staff to write some account of their experiences as
                  women in the Medical School at the time when women students were first admitted.
                  Each of them first wrote an independent account of the events they remembered most
                  vividly. They then got together and reduced the material to a brief account that
                  the Medical Alumni News might wish to publish. These were given in February 1983
                  as a gift from Nell Fuller of the Acquisitions Department at the CMHSL.</p>

                  handwritten entries are clippings for cures (croup, cough, nail in the foot,
                  toothache, consumption, burns, headaches, warts, baldness, etc.); directions (how
                  to get rid of rats, crullers, renovate black silk, oyster soup, etc.); and animal
                  care. One of the article clippings advertises the <title render="italic">Prairie
                     Farmer Annual</title> for 1871 and includes an article about the Sprague Mower
                  introduced in 1870. Donated by Kae Brown in 2010.</p>
