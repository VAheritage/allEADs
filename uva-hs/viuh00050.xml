      <p>Dr. Guy Harbert, the donor of this collection, wrote <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Virginia 1825 to 1999</title> (HS-RARE OVERSIZE RG 501 .V5 O37 2001). In his chronology he writes, "For almost 100 years, since its inception in 1825, medical education was listed as the University of Virginia Department of Medicine. In 1827 the appointment of Dr. Robley Dunglison (the first professor of medicine) was expanded to include the title 'Professor of Obstetrics.' Gynecology was first listed as a subject separate from surgery in 1891. Following that date, in general, obstetrics was included in medicine and gynecology in surgery. Dr. Douglas Macon, a 1897 graduate of the Medical School and Charlottesville physician living on High Street, was named Professor of Obstetrics in 1906. He taught obstetrics and was in charge of deliveries. In a reorganization of medical education in 1924, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology was formed." </p>
      <p>
Dr. Leroy A. Calkins was recruited to head the new Department. He resigned in 1929 to be replaced by Dr. F. Bayard Carter until the hiring of Dr. Tiffany J. Williams in 1931. Dr. Williams' correspondence, published papers and talks make up a sizeable portion of the collection. Dr. Williams served until his untimely death in 1947. Dr. John M. Nokes who arrived the same year as Dr. Williams as an Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology became the Acting Chairman. He served in that capacity until 1950 when Dr. W. Norman Thornton, Jr. became Chair. Dr. Thornton was followed by Dr. Paul B. Underwood, Jr. in 1979 who was chair until 1999.

The correspondence is all related to Dr. Tiffany J. Williams who was offered the position of Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and head of the service at the University of Virginia in a letter from Dean J. C. Flippin. Other correspondence is with Dr. Whitridge Williams of Johns Hopkins Hospital and E. Alderman, President of the University of Virginia and concerns Williams appointment as well as that of John Nokes. Williams wrote Dr. C. S. Lentz, the Superintendent of the UVa Hospital calling to his attention certain deficiencies in the nursing care on the Obstetrical wards at night due to only one nurse being on duty. There is a copy of the "Regulations Governing the Distribution of Gynecological Cases, University Hospital" and letters from Williams to Dr. Flippin and Dr. Harvey Jordan concerning the Department of Surgery and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and "the teaching of gynecology and the distribution of the gynecological teaching and ward clinical material."

Following the death of Tiffany Williams on August 19, 1947, Eugene S. Groseclose, C.H. Mauzy, W.N. Thornton, and Jack Kight decided that an annual lecture at UVa, to be known as "The Tiffany J. Williams Memorial Lecture" and given by a prominent obstetrician, would be a fitting tribute. It appears from the correspondence that two lectures were indeed held but by 1955 there had been a failure to continue the lectures each spring as originally planned. In 1961 a portrait was painted of Dr. Williams with money from the Williams fund and it appears that was the amount in the fund.
