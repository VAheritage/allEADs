                              <p> Oscar A. Thorup, Jr., was born March 12, 1922, in Washington D.C.,
                                        the son of Pattie Walter Creecy and Oscar A. Thorup. After
                                        earning his undergraduate degree in 1944 at the University
                                        of Virginia, he graduated from the U.Va. School of Medicine
                                        in 1946. He was a member of the Raven Society, Sigma Xi, and
                                        Alpha Omega Alpha. He did his internship at Queen's Hospital
                                        in Honolulu, Hawai'i, and then spent two years in the Army
                                        Medical Corps at Tripler General Hospital, also in Honolulu.
                                        He returned to U.Va. in 1949 for his residency training in
                                        internal medicine. He was a research fellow for one year at
                                        the University of North Carolina where he worked with Dr.
                                        Louis Welt on renal function, electrolyte balance, and
                                        metabolism. </p>
                              <p>In 1953 Dr. Thorup returned to U.Va. as an Instructor in Internal
                                        Medicine and as head of the Teachers" Preventorium. The next
                                        year he received a $30,000, five year grant from the John
                                        and Mary R. Markle Foundation which he used to study
                                        abnormal hemoglobins. He was also appointed an Assistant to
                                        the Dean in 1954 and worked closely with Dr. Thomas H.
                                        Hunter. He served as an Assistant Professor of Internal
                                        Medicine and Assistant to the Dean starting in 1955 until he
                                        was granted a year's leave of absence to be a visiting
                                        investigator in Oxford, England, in 1958. He worked with Dr.
                                        R. G. MacFarlane and Dr. Alan Sharp at the Radcliffe
                                        Infirmary on blood coagulation and continued his studies in
                                        abnormal hemoglobin. Before his return to U.Va., Dr. Thorup
                                        used a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to visit
                                        medical schools in Scandinavia to assess the feasibility of
                                        a staff and student exchange program with his alma mater.
                                        This program was eventually developed. He returned in 1959
                                        to U.Va. as an Associate Professor of Medicine. From 1961 to
                                        1966 he was the director of the Hematology Training Program
                                        and physician-in-charge of the Hematology Clinic. He served
                                        as director of the Harvey E. Jordan Research Laboratory
                                        where he studied red cell development and aging. </p>
                              <p>Dr. Thorup left U.Va. in 1966 to take a position at the University
                                        of Arizona's future medical school as professor and chair of
                                        the Department of Medicine. He worked with Merlin K. DuVal,
                                        M.D., and Philip Krutsch, M.D. as a three-man planning team
                                        developing a curriculum and interfacing with architects.
                                        While in Arizona, Dr. Thorup became particularly interested
                                        in the development of agencies that could guide and promote
                                        programs to increase equal access to health care and
                                        increase the general quality of health care while reducing
                                        cost by better management in planning. He was a proponent of
                                        communities correcting their own problems rather than having
                                        federal government involvement. While in Arizona, he was
