      <p>Edward Watson Hook, Jr. was born in Sumter, South Carolina on August 10, 1924. He was
                the only child of school teacher parents. He obtained a B.S. degree from Wofford
                College in Spartanburg, South Carolina and then attended Yale University as a
                participant in the U.S. Army Specialized Training program. He received an M.D.
                degree from Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia in 1949. He served his
                internship at University Hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota and was an assistant
                resident and chief resident in medicine at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta,
                Georgia. From 1951 to 1953 he served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps. He taught
                medicine at Emory University and Johns Hopkins University before becoming the Head
                of the Division of Infectious Disease at Cornell University Medical College in New
                York in July 1959. In 1966, Hook was a visiting professor at the University of Bahia
                School of Medicine in Salvador, Brazil. In 1969 he was appointed Henry B. Mulholland
                Professor of Internal Medicine at the University of Virginia and chaired the
                department for 21 years. In 1996 Hook was presented with the Thomas Jefferson Award,
                the highest award given at the University of Virginia. Hook married Jessie Dale
                Thurecht on June 14, 1949. They had four children, Edward W. III, Susan Dale,
                Margaret Jane, and Robert Randall. Hook died unexpectedly of a coronary blood clot
                on October 5, 1998 at the age of 74. </p>
      <p>Dr. Hook was involved in a great many organizations and endeavors outside of UVA. He
                took a leading role in several specialty and subspecialty societies and in
                organizations concerned with physician education and training. Hook was president of
                the Infectious Diseases Society of America during 1975-76, was chair of the Board of
                Scientific Counselors of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
                was a charter member of the editorial board of Antimicrobial Agents and
                Chemotherapy, and was a chair of the board of directors of the Robert Wood Johnson
                Foundation Clinical Scholars Program from 1978 to 1988. A former president of the
                Association of Professors of Medicine, Dr. Hook served on the American Board of
                Internal Medicine from 1979 to 1987 and chaired its committee on the Evaluation of
                Clinical Competence. </p>
      <p>A fellow of the American College of Physicians (ACP) since 1962
                and its president in 1985, Dr. Hook also served as the College’s governor in
                Virginia and on its board of regents. He visited the People’s Republic of China in
                1979 as a member of the ACP’s first teaching delegation to that country. Hook
                authored over 130 publications. He received distinction early in his career for his
                research on the pathogenesis of salmonella and other intestinal infections. </p>
      <p>Administration duties of running Internal Medicine took up the bulk of Hook's
                professional time. During his years as chairman, he built up the department of
                internal medicine, recruited highly trained division leaders, and initiated several
                programs that benefited the School of Medicine. In 1969 he founded an international
                health exchange program with the Federal University of Ceará in Brazil. He also
                developed and led UVa's hospital ethics committee. He began a primary care residency
                program in medicine and started a faculty-teaching practice program in Orange
                County. During the 1970s and 80s, Hook was a national leader in internal-medicine
                manpower, clinical skills evaluation, and the fostering of humanitarian attributes
                among physicians. Hook was keenly interested in teaching medical students. </p>
      <p>After retiring from the chair of the department in 1990, Hook founded the humanities
                in medicine program. This program offered talks, concerts, and short courses for
                medical students. He also helped lead the Medical Center Hour, a weekly conference
                covering health issues. Hook was also chair of the Arts program which used art work
                to beautify the hospital. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>The Edward Watson Hook materials reflect his wide-ranging professional activities
                related to heading the Department of Internal Medicine, participating in the larger
                Health System/University processes, and pursuing his own research and external
                activities. The documents detail Hook's direct personal participation in
                professional organizations and also show the wide range of details he coordinated in
                running the department of internal medicine. A noteworthy aspect of the collection
                includes an unpublished History of the Department of Medicine written by Byrd
                Leavell. Hook read and critiqued the manuscript, but Leavell died before completing
                the book. Also, Hook conducted a series of interviews with Thomas H. Hunter which
                complement with the Thomas H. Hunter Collection, MS-4, Claude Moore Health Sciences
                Library. </p>
