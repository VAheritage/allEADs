      <p>Henry Rose Carter was born on Clifton Plantation, Caroline
         County, Virginia, August 25, 1851 or 1852. He attended Aspen
         Hill Academy in Louisa County, Virginia, and completed studies
         there in 1868. After teaching in a boys school in Nelson
         County, Virginia, he entered the University of Virginia, where
         he earned proficiency certificates in Mineralogy and Geology,
         and in Physics, and a diploma from the School of Pure
         Mathematics in June of 1872. In July 1873, he earned diplomas
         from the Schools of General and Industrial Chemistry, Natural
         Philosophy, Applied Mathematics, and Civil Engineering.
         Subsequently Carter pursued an interest in Medicine, and he
         recieved an M.D. degree from the University of Maryland in
         March of 1879. That year he joined the Marine Hospital Service
         (later the United States Public Health Service) and over his
         career ascended through the ranks to become Assistant Surgeon
         General in 1915.</p>
      <p>Initial postings with the Service took him to Cairo,
         Illinois -- where he met and married Laura Hook, of St. Louis,
         Missouri, on September 29, 1880 -- Memphis, Tennessee; San
         Francisco, California; and New Orleans, Louisiana. The Service
         detailed him as a quarantine officer to Ship Island,
         Mississippi in 1888, and here began his researches with yellow
         fever, which he would quickly refine to an extremely high
         level of expertise. Carter's thorough and methodical
         observations of the appearance and development of the disease
         proved critical to Dr. Walter Reed's landmark demonstration of
         the mosquito transmission of yellow fever in 1900. Assigned to
         Cuba in 1899, Carter's tour of duty overlapped with those of
         Reed and the other members of the famous United States Army
         Yellow Fever Commission, who were able to learn first-hand of
         Carter's most recent conclusions.</p>
      <p>Carter's long and distinguished sanitary career took him to
         the Panama Canal Zone in 1904, where he served as Chief
         Quarantine Officer and Chief of Hospitals for five years. He
         also undertook detailed investigations and control measures of
         malaria in North Carolina and elsewhere in the South, and
         became a founder of the National Malaria Committee. With the
         support of the Rockefeller Foundation International Health
         Board, he undertook additional investigation and control
         measures for yellow fever in Central and South America. His
         expertise recommended him to the Peruvian government, which
         named Carter Sanitary Advisor in 1920-1921.</p>
      <p>Health problems at the end of his life compelled Carter to
         withdraw from active fieldwork, though he remained a highly
         valued consultant to the Health Board and a much-beloved and
         respected teacher for a new generation of sanitarians. Carter
         closed his career researching and writing the manuscript that
         his daughter, Laura Armistead Carter, edited and published
         posthumously in 1931: 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Yellow Fever: An Epidemiological and

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Carter Papers include correspondence relating to
         Carter's work on yellow fever and malaria as a surgeon in the
         Marine Health Service (later United States Public Health
         Service) and notes for drafts of his 
         <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Yellow Fever: An Epidemiological and
         Historical Study of its Place of Origin.</title>(Baltimore:
         The Williams and Wilkins Company, 1931). Included are
         photographs of and newspaper clippings about Carter, in
         addition to a small collection of reprints and publications by
         Carter and others. Also included is the correspondence of his
         daughter, Laura Armistead Carter with Frederick F. Russell and
         other members of the Rockefeller Foundation International
         Health Board, Wade Hampton Frost, of Johns Hopkins University,
         and others concerning her collaboration with Frost in the
         editing and publication of Carter's book. Also included are a
         series of eighteenth-century to mid-nineteenth-century
         documents principally belonging to Carter's great-grandfather,
         George Mason, of Spotsylvania and Caroline Counties, Virginia
         and to Mary Ann Brown, sister of Carter's mother.</p>
