      <p>Alpha Omega Alpha was founded in 1902 and is the national medical honor society. It
                started at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago when a small number of
                medical students, led by William Webster Root, wanted to foster professional values
                and good conduct in fellow medical students and sometimes in their faculty. Modeled
                after Phi Beta Kappa, they stated that membership in the new society would be based
                on both academic achievement and professional conduct.</p>
      <p> By 2012 there were more than 130 chapters in medical schools throughout the United
                Sates. The AOA mission statement found on their website indicates that it is
                “dedicated to the belief that in the profession of medicine we will improve care for
                all by recognizing high educational achievement, honoring gifted teaching,
                encouraging the development of leaders in academia and the community, supporting the
                ideals of humanism, and promoting service to others." </p>
      <p>The University of Virginia chapter started in 1919 and was the 23rd member. The first
                school in Virginia to join, its chapter is named Alpha Virginia. Each chapter may
                elect to membership no more than one-sixth of the anticipated number of graduates.
                Those elected must come from the top quartile of students academically. According to
                the UVa School of Medicine Student Handbook on the SOM website, those chosen from
                UVa must not only exhibit the necessary academic attainment, but also leadership,
                professionalism, a sense of ethics, promise of future success in medicine, and
                commitment to service. At UVa generally 6-9 students are elected by their peers
                after their second year, and another 17 or so are elected after their third year.
