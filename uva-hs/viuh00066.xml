        <p>The documents in boxes 1-19, folder 7 arrived at the Claude Moore Health Sciences Library
          in several installments from the School of Medicine prior to 2014. On December 2, 2014
          Addeane Caelleigh, a Medical Educaiton Case Writer at the School of Medicine brought the
          materials in boxes 19, folder 8 through 21, folder 2 to Historical Collections.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>The collection consists of 104 folders of processed material. Series I contains annual
        reports of the School of Medicine from the 1970s and then biennial reports through the 1980s
        with a planning report that looks forward to 2000. The reports come from the various
        departments and divisions within the School of Medicine. Series II has only two documents
        concerning the development of biostatistics and epidemiology as well as a Family Medicine
        residency in Lynchburg. Series III includes documents on the methods taken to increase the
        number of minority medical students as well as minority faculty. One document concerns the
        entire university. Series IV has documents, reports, studies, questionnaire summaries, and
        data from self-studies. Self-studies were done for the Southern Association of Colleges and
        Schools, and in some cases those documents relate to the entire University with only
        sections that concern the School of Medicine. Other self-studies were done for the Liaison
        Committee on Medical Education (LCME) which represented the American Medical Association and
        the Association of American Medical Colleges. Documents in the collection are instructional
        in terms of how to prepare for the LCME site visits as well as documents submitted prior to
        the visits. Liaison Committee on Medical Education visits for reaccreditation occurred on
        October 11-15, 1998, October 8-11, 2006, and October 19-22, 2014. </p>

              II Academic Affairs , Section III Deanâs Summary and Recommendations. It states that
              due to new pressures and the need for better organization in the School of Medicine,
              and in response to Universityâwide programs, several tasks were completed by faculty.
              Some of these are included in the report including the identification and adoption of
              institutional goals, a report on plans and projections, a financial report to the
              President, and a preliminary policy report on promotions and tenure. The deanâs
              summary gives information on a variety of topics, but of note is the formation of the
              Department of Family Practice on July 1, 1975 and a Division of Dentistry in 1974, the
              completion of the new Health Sciences Library, an award toward the construction of a
              Primary Care Building, and an experimental or alternative curriculum for the School of
              Medicine.</p>

            <p> The annual report includes a âSummary of Major Accomplishments in Instruction,
              Research, and Public Serviceâ which highlights a few of the major accomplishments of
              the individual departments. Dean Norman Knorr mentions a major revision of the
              preclinical curriculum by the council on Medical Education and a new Division of
              Geriatrics under the leadership of Richard Lindsay with the anticipation of a special
              geriatric unit to be established at the Blue Ridge Sanatorium in the future. Currently
              there are established programs in epilepsy and outpatient Psychiatry at Blue Ridge.
              Another new Division is Geographic Medicine under the direction of Richard Guerrant.
              There is a report from the Office of Student Affairs and a break-down of SOM
              admissions.</p>

            <p> A memo inserted in front of the 1978-1979 Annual Report from Dean Norman Knorr,
              dated September 14, 1981, indicates that the School of Medicine Biennial Report
              (formerly Annual Report) is waived this year as the plan is to submit the Self-Study
              Report in its place. The 1978-1979 annual report includes a âSummary of Major
              Accomplishments in Teaching Programs, Research Programs, and Public Service
              Activitiesâ and a report from the Office of Student Affairs. </p>

            <p> This summary of the biennial report highlights a few of the accomplishments in
              teaching programs, training programs, clinical service programs, research programs,
              and public service activities. The School of Medicine did a self-study in preparation
              for the LCME accreditation site visit held in February 1982. The LCME conferred full
              accreditation of the program for 10 years. A new graduate program in Cell and
              Molecular Biology was established in 1982 and a number of new divisions were formed.
              New units opened at Blue Ridge Hospital and a Travelers Clinic and the Blue Ridge
              Poison Control Center were established at the University Hospital. UVa Medcial Center
              was designated a Level I Trauma Center in 1982. James W. Craig submitted a report from
              the Office of Student Affairs. </p>
