<head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Collection is a valuable source for the understanding of the history of the University of Virginia Medical Center from 1972 to 1977. In this period, the University Medical Center was taking steps toward not
only the enlargement of its resources - facilities, personnel, and finance - but also its major programs - education, research, and patient care. The beginning of the Family Practice Primary Care Curriculum in
1975 and the projects for the expansion of existing hospital buildings and purchase of the Towers Hospital were remarkable developments in this period. All these projects were planned based on the UVA Medical
Center's wide-ranging self-surveys and implemented under the guidance of William R. Drucker, Dean of the School of Medicine and James W. Craig, Associate Dean of the School of Medicine.
</p>
<p>Collection materials were donated by James W. Craig in 1989. Dr. Craig joined the School of Medicine at the University of Virginia in 1972 as Professor of Internal Medicine and Associate Dean of the School of
Medicine. This Collection reflects major developments of the Medical Center in his earlier career at the University of Virginia.
