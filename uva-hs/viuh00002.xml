        <p>The American Lung Association of Virginia (ALAV) donated the organization's papers to
               the University of Virginia Health Sciences Library in 1990 and 1991, under the
               auspices of then ALAV Executive Director, Dr. Carl Booberg. Another large donation
               from the ALAV was made in 2009.</p>

      <p>The American Lung Association (ALA) is the oldest voluntary public health agency in the
            United States. The original name of the ALA was the National Association for the Study
            and Prevention of Tuberculosis (NASPT), formed in 1904 to combat the deadliest disease
            of the time. The name was changed to the National Tuberculosis Association (NTA) in
            1918, and finally, with the decline of TB and the rise of other serious lung diseases,
            to the American Lung Association (ALA) in 1973. The American Lung Association of
            Virginia (ALAV) has been similarly renamed since its formation in 1909 as the Virginia
            Anti-Tuberculosis Association. Today, both the national and state associations are
            dedicated to the prevention, cure, and control of all lung diseases.</p>
      <p>The American Lung Association is perhaps best known as "The Christmas Seal People."
            Since 1907, the Christmas Seal Campaign has raised many millions of dollars toward the
            fight against lung disease. In 1915, the NASPT launched the Modern Health Crusade,
            originally to involve children in the Christmas Seal Campaign. Any child who sold ten or
            more Seals was given a "Crusader certificate of enrollment" on which was printed a list
            of health rules such as "keep windows open" and "get a long night's sleep." Children who
            complied with these standards were "promoted" from squire to knight, then to knight
            banneret, and finally to knight of the round table. By 1919 there were three million
            "crusaders" in the United States. Two years later, the National Education Association
            recommended the adoption of a Crusade-like health education system in every elementary
            school in the country.</p>
      <p>The ALAV Collection contains extensive information on the tuberculosis sanatoriums
            established in Virginia. When the NASPT formed in 1904, there were approximately one
            hundred sanatoriums in the United States; by 1910, there were nearly four hundred. One
            of the many sanatoriums built during this period was the Catawba Sanatorium near
            Roanoke, the first sanatorium in the state of Virginia. In 1908, Captain William
            Washington Baker (1844-1927), a member of the Virginia General Assembly, introduced a
            bill to reorganize the State Board of Health. The "Baker Bill" appropriated $20,000 "for
            the establishment and maintenance of a suitable sanatorium for consumptives." Baker had
            lost four of his six children to tuberculosis. For his pioneering efforts, he is justly
            called "the father of Catawba Sanatorium." Baker was also instrumental in the formation
            of the Virginia Anti-Tuberculosis Association (now the ALAV) in October 1909.</p>
      <p>In 1918, the State Board of Health and the Negro Organization Society founded Piedmont
            Sanatorium as a rest home for African-Americans. Before its establishment, the only
            treatment facilities for African- Americans were the Central State Hospital for Mental
            Diseases and the State Penitentiary. Miss Agnes D. Randolph, Director of the Educational
            Department of the State Board of Health, requested in 1916 an appropriation from the
            General Assembly to build the sanatorium and purchase three hundred acres of land near
            Burkeville. The first building at the site was named in her honor.</p>
      <p>Blue Ridge Sanatorium opened in April of 1920. The close proximity of the University of
            Virginia Medical School was a major factor in the government's selection of the
            Charlottesville area as the site for the new facility. The State Board of Health and the
            University agreed that a special course in TB would be developed for third and fourth
            year medical students, to be taught by the Medical Director of Blue Ridge Sanatorium and
            his staff. The city of Charlottesville donated $15,000 for the building project and
            promised free water from the city supply for five years.</p>
      <p>An online exhibit created by the Historical Collections and Services staff of The Claude
            Moore Health Sciences Library at the University of Virginia recounts the origin and
            early history of the ALA. All of the materials featured in the Web exhibit
            (http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/alav/) are from the Library's ALAV Collection in
            Historical Collections and Services.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The ALAV Collection contains personal and official correspondence, financial and legal
            papers, minute books, organizational and scientific reports, educational publicity,
            photographs, and artifacts. The ALAV Collection contains exhaustive information on the
            administrative concerns, educational and fund-raising activities, local level activities
            and regional offices, and the day-to-day operations of Virginia's key agent in the
            control and prevention of respiratory diseases. The materials in the ALAV Collection
            document the growth of the organization, as well as the input of a number of notable
            Virginians, from the early decades of the twentieth century. The ALAV Collection
            contains materials of use to researchers interested in medical history, epidemiology,
            respiratory diseases, and the growth of state and national organizations dedicated to
            public health.</p>
