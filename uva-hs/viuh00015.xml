      <p>Blue Ridge Sanatorium opened on April 26, 1920 just outside
         of Charlottesville, Virginia. It was funded by a mill tax
         passed by the Virginia General Assembly in 1918. 1/8 of the
         funds raised by this tax were designated for prevention and
         eradication of tuberculosis. The State Board of Health was
         charged with administration of these funds. Catawba Sanatorium
         had been operating for nearly ten years with a lengthy waiting
         list. Piedmont Sanatorium opened outside of Burkeville in 1918
         for African Americans. The Charlottesville area welcomed Blue
         Ridge Sanatorium by donating $15,000.00 toward the purchase of
         land and construction, and by offering to supply free city
         water to the sanatorium for its first five years of operation.
         Proximity to the University of Virginia Hospital added to the
         attractiveness of the location.</p>
      <p>The Addison, Strode, and Thomas pavilions were constructed
         in 1919 to house patients, with men assigned to the Strode
         pavilion, and women to the Addison pavilion. When children
         were added to the patient population in 1922, they lived in
         the Thomas Pavilion. Rooms in the pavilions were connected to
         long porches where patients sat during the day and slept at
         night. Fresh air was considered a vital element in the
         curative regimen, which also included rest, moderate exercise,
         and a diet of fresh fruits, vegetables, milk and reduced
         animal protein. Early treatments also included the use of an
         Alpine lamp, a type of sun lamp believed to assist in the cure
         of tuberculosis. Patients organized the Cheer-Up Club to raise
         funds for needy patients, to purchase victrolas and records,
         and sponsor concerts for patients and staff.</p>
      <p>Trinkle Infirmary was built in 1922. A chapel was added
         several years later, and the George W. Wright Memorial
         Pavilion was erected in 1927 with funds raised by the Grand
         Lodge of Masons of Virginia. A teacher joined the staff in
         1923 to help resident children keep up in school. In 1937 an
         adult Rehabilitation School opened to help patients improve
         their economic circumstances upon release. To help with
         staffing, a training school for nurses was started in July of
         1920 with one nurse in the first graduating class. In 1933,
         the training school for tuberculosis nurses established a
         formal affiliation with the Nurses Training School of the
         University of Virginia. The final graduating class of the Blue
         Ridge Nurses Training School held commencement exercises on
         May 24, 1962.</p>
      <p>W. E. Brown oversaw much of the growth and changes at the
         sanatorium in his 23 year tenure as Superintendent from 1921
         until 1944. During the years of the Great Depression, food was
         scarce and many people with symptoms of tuberculosis could not
         afford to apply for treatment. They waited until their cases
         were significantly advanced with less likelihood of a cure.
         The number of admissions of patients with advanced cases
         increased. At the same time over 1/3 of the patients
         discharged cited lack of ability to pay the $7.00 weekly fee
         as their reason for leaving, even when they were not
         considered cured. In 1932 the sanatorium purchased adjacent
         land which it used for farming and for establishment of a
         dairy herd to supply fresh milk to patients. In 1939 a new
         infirmary, the East Wing, was constructed with funds from a
         WPA grant to address the increase in advanced non-ambulatory
         cases.</p>
      <p>World War II saw a drastic shortage in supplies and staff,
         as rationing reduced the quantity and quality of food products
         available, and the war created a shortage of nurses, orderlies
         and other trained workers. In 1943 an "Honor Camp" of
         penitentiary prisoners were put to work in the cafeteria.
         Screening for Selective Service resulted in identification of
         early cases of tuberculosis and more patients were admitted
         with less advanced cases. Interns from the University of
         Virginia entered into three month rotations at Blue Ridge,
         learning to perform "chest work" such as pneumothorax. This
         process involved using a needle to deliberately collapse the
         infected lung in order to give it time to heal and contain the
         lesion within. While diet and environment were never
         discounted as key aspects of treatment, surgical intervention
         became increasingly important. E. Cato Drash and other
         surgeons from the University of Virginia performed thoracic
         surgery on a growing number of patients. Frequently doctors
         and nurses diagnosed with tuberculosis came to Blue Ridge as
         patients and stayed on as employees.</p>
      <p>In the early 1950's, new drugs were developed to assist in
         the cure of tuberculosis. These included isonicotinic acid
         hydrazide, streptomycin, para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) and
         isoniazid. There was a steady decline in the waiting list for
         the sanatorium as more people remained at home and received
         drug therapy from their family doctors. In 1954, for the first
         time in its history, the sanatorium had vacancies for women.
         The average age of admitted patients was higher than
         previously, presenting additional challenges in addressing the
         health needs of an older patient population. In 1965 African
         Americans were admitted to Blue Ridge for the first time upon
         the closing of Piedmont Tuberculosis Sanatorium. In 1970
         various proposals to expand Blue Ridge Sanatorium programs
         beyond treatment of tuberculosis surfaced. These included the
         integration of alcoholics with trustee prisoners into a
         program of work and rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>The construction of Interstate 64 in 1968 cut through the
         sanatorium property and the farmland across the highway was
         deeded to the city of Charlottesville, the future site of
         Piedmont Virginia Community College. In 1978, title to the
         Blue Ridge Sanatorium property was transferred to the
         University of Virginia and it was renamed Blue Ridge Hospital.
         Tuberculosis patients continued to receive treatment there,
         but additional University of Virginia medical center programs
         were also located on the site. These included obesity and
         diabetic clinics as well as the outpatient division of the
         Department of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry. The
         University of Virginia LPN program relocated to Blue Ridge in
         1979, and the Institute of Law, Psychiatry, and Public Policy
         was also located there.</p>
