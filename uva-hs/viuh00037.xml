                    <p> The notes were taken by Charles Shepherd Webb. According to his brief
                        autobiography, when he attended the University of Virginia, he took a
                        "thorough course in the theoretical branches and then went to the University
                        of New York to get the benefit of the hospitals." He graduated with the
                        degree of M.D. from the University of New York.</p>
                    <p> The UVa lecturer was John Staige Davis in anatomy. The notebook also
                        contains notes that were given by Professor Darling at the University of New
                        York and another section on materia medica.</p>
                    <p> The notebook was donated by Ann W. McDowell, Webb's granddaughter, in March
                        2010. </p>

                    <p> The notebook by Patton K. Pierce, UVA SOM class of 1921, includes Laboratory
                        Exercises in Physiological Chemistry and Pharmacology. Experiments were done
                        on animals including dog, cat, rabbit, turtle, rat, and frog, or various animal organs, with
                        drugs such as alcohol, morphine, ether, caffeine, amyl nitrate, chloroform,
                        opium, and strychnine. Also cocaine was applied to the student's tongue.
                        There is no professor listed but James Alexander Waddell taught Pharmacology,
                        Materia Medica and Toxicology in this time period. According to Southern
                        Medical News, November 1925, "Dr. Patton Kimbrough Pierce, Eutaw [Alabama],
                        aged 30, died August 16 at hospital in Harrisburg, Va. [probably incorrect,
                        probably Alabama] of injuries received when the automobile in which he was
                        driving overturned."</p>
