The notes were taken by Charles Shepherd Webb. According to his brief autobiography, when he attended the University of Virginia, he took a "thorough course in the theoretical branches and then went to the University of New York to get the benefit of the hospitals." He graduated with the degree of M.D. from the University of New York.  The UVa lecturer was John Staige Davis in anatomy. The notebook also contains notes that were given by Professor Darling at the University of New York and another section on materia medica. The notebook was donated by Ann W. McDowell, Webb's granddaughter, in March 2010.
