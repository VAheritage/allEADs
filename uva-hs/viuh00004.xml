      <p>The 8th Evacuation Hospital was organized and staffed by University of Virginia physicians
        and nurses during World War II. In February of 1942, University President John L. Newcomb
        and Dean of the School of Medicine, Harvey E. Jordan, gave permission for the organization
        of a medical unit for war service designed to be an evacuation hospital for emergency
        surgical cases. In March of 1942, Dr. Staige D. Blackford was made director of the unit. Dr.
        E. Cato Drash assisted Dr. Blackford in organizing a staff of over four hundred people for
        the 750-bed evacuation hospital, including 47 commissioned officers and 52 commissioned
        nurses. Ruth Beery, a former instructor at the School of Nursing, was made the principal
        chief nurse. Organization was completed by May of 1942.</p>
      <p>The unit went through basic training during the summer of 1942 and was activated on August
        19, 1942 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lincoln F. Putnam. In November of 1942, the
        men of the 8th Evacuation Hospital shipped out on the U.S.S. Santa Paula and went ashore at
        Casablanca where they set up a provisional general hospital at the former Italian consulate.
        Colonel John W. McKoan took over as commanding officer and oversaw the closing of the
        hospital four months after its establishment. During that time there were nearly 4,200
        admissions and thousands of outpatients were treated in outpatient departments and the
        dental clinic.</p>
      <p>On March 14, 1943 the 8th Evacuation Hospital moved to a new location on Anfa Hill where
        they were joined by 51 nurses and began to function as a convalescent hospital, caring for
        nearly 1,460 inpatients before being dismantled and parked in early June. The unit moved to
        a bivouac area at Camp Matifou, Algiers for six weeks until they were assigned to Salerno,
        Italy. After their arrival in Italy, they learned that all the hospital equipment had been
        lost, but they quickly managed to procure tents, a telephone system, generator and
        laboratory equipment. The hospital moved to Caserta and stayed there from October until
        December of 1943, and then spent three months in Teano functioning as a field hospital for
        combat operation. In Italy the hospital became very efficient at following the moving front
        line of the Allied forces. The Allied advance slowed in the fall of 1944 and the 8th Evac.
        was assigned to a muddy field in Pietramala, a mountainous area north of Florence, where
        they stayed for six months. The fall was wet and muddy and the winter cold and snowy. During
        this time the unit treated over 9,000 inpatients, of whom half were injured and wounded.</p>
      <p>The end of fighting in Italy in the spring of 1945 meant that some members of the 8th Evac.
        were sent home, others to the Pacific, and others set up hospitals near Verona and Lake
        Garda. E. Cato Drash was made commanding officer as the 8th Evac. spent four months at Lake
        Garda treating almost 5,000 inpatients, mostly for disease. In the fall of 1945 the 8th
        Evacuation Hospital was demobilized after three and a half years of active duty. Over 48,000
        patients, twice as many as were admitted to the University of Virginia Hospital in
        1942-1944, were admitted to the 8th Evacuation Hospital in Africa and Italy over the three
        year period. Of those patients fourteen percent were injured, twenty-two percent were
        wounded, and sixty-four percent were sick. There were 253 deaths, or about half of one
        percent. More than 53,000 outpatients were seen in clinics.</p>
      <p>The Hospital functioned in the heat of North Africa and southern Italy and in the rain,
        snow, and cold of the Italian mountains. At times the operating areas were all in use with a
        hundred men waiting for surgery, and at other times the staff had time on their hands and
        little to entertain themselves with. The unit received more awards, commendations, and
        decorations than most similar units and served longer in North Africa and Italy than any
        other American hospital. The men and women of the 8th Evacuation Hospital served their
        country well and were excellent representatives of the University of Virginia.</p>

            orthopedic surgeon, and Dorothy Sandridge Gloor, a surgical nurse in the unit." The
            paper is in partial fulfillment of requirements for GNUR 8230: Historical Inquiry in
