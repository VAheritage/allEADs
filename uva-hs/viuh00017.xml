      <head>Biographical/Historical Information </head>
      <p>After the United States entered World War I, Dr. William H. Goodwin contacted the Red
                Cross in Washington D.C. in regard to organizing a base hospital at the University
                of Virginia. The authority to organize a hospital was granted, and UVa President E.
                A. Alderman recommended the appointment of Dr. Goodwin as director. On June 23, 1917
                the hospital was assigned number 41. Dr. Goodwin learned he would need to recruit
                all the supporting staff of the hospital as well as its doctors and nurses. It was
                also his responsibility to acquire funds to purchase the supplies for the hospital
                as the War Department had determined that only fully equipped and supplied hospitals
                would be accepted for active service. Dr. Goodwin contacted the Benevolent and
                Protective Order of Elks of the U.S, which had collected from its members a
                substantial amount of money to be used as a war relief fund. The Elks agreed to
                furnish all of the needed funds and deposited the money with the Red Cross. </p>
      <p>Well-qualified officers were selected as well as 149 enlisted men, 49 of them UVa
                alumni or students. On March 5, 1918, the detachment entrained for Camp Sevier,
                South Carolina, where it was organized by Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Julian M.
                Cabell and no longer considered a Red Cross unit. Two months later after intensive
                training, Cabell reported to the Surgeon General that the unit was ready for
                overseas duty. </p>
      <p>Finally on July 26, 1918, Base Hospital 41 arrived in St. Denis, France, near Paris
                at the park of l'Ecole de la Legion d'Honneur. The hospital was established in the
                building used for schooling children of the members of the Legion of Honor. Secured
                for Base Hospital 41 by the American Red Cross, it was a stately eighteenth century
                building in a lovely park setting. The school dormitories were converted into
                hospital wards, and by August 12th Base Hospital 41 was ready to receive patients,
                meaning that the wards, operating rooms, laboratories, and ancillary services were
                set to function. </p>
      <p>The first convoy consisted of 136 patients who were treated promptly and efficiently.
                The capacity of the building was soon reached and new tent wards were constantly
                being pitched in the park. Eventually the hospital was equipped to care for 600
                patients in the building and another 2200 in the tent wards. One of the most
                stressful periods was from 4 PM on October 19, 1918, to 10 AM on October 22, 1918,
                when 693 patients were admitted to an already full hospital. </p>
      <p>Base Hospital 41 had to contend with the influenza epidemic of 1918. A considerable
                percentage of both personnel and patients were attacked, and four staff members died
                of pneumonia following flu. Although not at the front, the unit also suffered from
                several air raids. </p>
      <p>When the Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918, nearly three thousand patients
                were in the hospital. Two and a half months later, all the patients had been
                evacuated, and the hospital ceased to function. The unit was demobilized on May 1,
                1919. </p>
