      <p>Henry Hanson was born July 4, 1877 in Glenwood, South Dakota and credits his father
                for passing down a “pioneer spirit” that led him to “scientific and medical
                research.” He received an A.B. in 1902 and an A.M. in chemistry in 1904 from the
                University of South Dakota. He then moved to Baltimore to pursue an M.D. at the
                Johns Hopkins University which he achieved in 1908. After briefly working in
                Milwaukee, in 1909, Hanson moved to Florida to become Director of the Division of
                Bacteriological Laboratories of the State Board of Health. </p>
      <p>When the U.S. entered World War I, Hanson joined the Army Medical Corps and was
                stationed in Panama for the duration. Hanson distinguished himself and was appointed
                Chief Sanitary Inspector of the Panama Canal Zone in 1918. When the Peruvian
                government recruited him in 1919, Hanson brought his family to Peru. He recounted
                their adventures in The Pied Piper of Peru: Dr. Henry Hanson’s Fight against “Yellow
                Jack” and Bubonic Plague in South America, 1919-1922 which was published
                posthumously in 1961 by the Florida Department of Public Health. Hanson also
                summarized this work in his diary, stating that there were almost 20,000 cases of
                yellow fever during this period and nearly two million house inspections and five
                million container inspections carried out in the massive campaign. </p>
      <p>After the successes in Peru, Hanson went to Columbia under the auspices of the
                International Health Board and the Columbian government to continue work on
                eradicating yellow fever and other tropical diseases. Hanson's wife, Jane, and their
                two children, Martha and Karl, stayed in Panama. Jane was expecting the couple's
                third child (Virgil), and sadly passed away in childbirth. Hanson wrote in his diary
                on the anniversary of his wife's death: “El dia mas triste de mi vida el 19
                diciembre 1923.” (Translation: The saddest day of my life on December 19, 1923). </p>
      <p>Hanson’s struggle in deciding to join the West Africa Yellow Fever Commission only a
                couple of years after his wife's death is shown through letters to Dr. Henry Rose
                Carter. “While I am becoming somewhat reconciled to this individual existence
                puttering along with one specimen after another I still ‘feel the call of the wild’
                and should like to be out fighting again.” Hanson spent the majority of his time in
                Southwestern Nigeria focused on work with over 5,000 house visits in twenty-two
                months. </p>
      <p>After returning to the United States in 1927, Hanson and his family moved to Florida
                where he accepted a position with the Bureau of Communicable Diseases, State Board
                of Health of Florida. He became the State Health Officer in 1929 and served two
                terms from 1929-1935 and 1942-1945. In the intervening years, Hanson worked as the
                traveling representative of the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau 1936-1942. </p>
      <p>Dr. Hanson’s focus on public health issues included rodent eradication (perhaps
                recalling the “burning of Paita” when he burned houses to kill rats and thus end a
                bubonic plague outbreak in the Peruvian town of Pieta in 1920) and establishing
                statewide mosquito control efforts. After a very successful career, he retired in
                1945 and moved to Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
      <p>Dr. Henry Hanson passed away at age 76 on February 13, 1954. In 1959 the Florida
                State Board of Health laboratory building was renamed “The Henry Hanson Building.”

                Collections web exhibit on Hanson. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>The diary begins October 4, 1925, the day after Hanson boarded the S.S. Majestic in
                New York City to cross the Atlantic as the first leg in his journey to Nigeria to be
                part of the West Africa Yellow Fever Commission. Hanson summarized his work in the
                Peruvian campaigns from July 1919 to May 1922 as well as mentioned the time he spent
                in Central America, but the bulk of the diary describes his work in southwestern
                Nigeria which included 5,000 house visits to inspect for containers with water and
                breeding mosquitoes in 22 months. Hanson stated the language barrier and climate
                were major difficulties. He left Nigeria on May 17, 1927 and the diary ends on July
                27, 1927 when he is in England.</p>
