</head>
<p>According to the obituary in "The Daily Progress" on August 19, 2006, Catherine Marie Russell was born November 20, 1910, in Tuckahoe, New York. She earned her undergraduate degree from the College of Mt. St. Vincent in Riverdale, NY; her Masters in Botany from Columbia University in 1948; and her PhD in Microbiology from the University of Virginia in 1951. She was appointed to the UVa faculty in 1952 as an Assistant Professor of Clinical Pathology and Microbiology. She became a full Professor in 1974, the first woman to do so in the UVa School of Medicine. She retired in 1977 and was elected Professor Emeritus of Pathology and Associate Professor of Microbiology. Dr. Russell helped establish the bacteriology lab at the Medical Center and published many articles on her research in parasitology and bacteriology. She was a member of the American Society of Microbiologists and the Society of Tropical Medicine. She was listed in the National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel.
In addition to her academic accomplishments she was active in religious education programs at both Holy Comforter Catholic Church and St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church, both in Charlottesville, Virginia. She died August 16, 2006, in Charlottesville, Virginia.
