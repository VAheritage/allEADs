         <p>E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr., a life-long resident of the
         Washington, D.C. area, received his undergraduate degree from
         Yale University in 1949. He attended law school at the
         University of Virginia and served on the editorial board of
         the 
         <title render="italic">Virginia Law Review</title>. In
         addition he was active in the Student Legal Forum on behalf of
         which he extended speaking invitations to Justices Robert H.
         Jackson and Felix Frankfurter, both of whom accepted. In late
         1952 Prettyman was selected to clerk for Justice Jackson after
         graduation the following June.</p>
         <p>The Supreme Court was deeply involved in consideration of 
         <title render="italic">Brown v. Board of Education</title>when
         Prettyman began his clerkship. In his history of 
         <title render="italic">Brown</title>titled 
         <title render="italic">Simple Justice</title>(New York: Alfred
         Knopf, 1975), Richard Kluger describes in detail the work of
         the justices in early 1954. "[Chief Justice Earl] Warren's
         highest hope, for a single unanimous opinion, did not look
         especially bright. It rested in large part on his overcoming
         the philosophical reservations of both Felix Frankfurter and
         Robert Jackson, men who could talk, write and think rings
         around the Chief Justice. Neither was likely to curl up at
         Warren's mere bidding."(683)</p>
         <p>Justice Frankfurter circulated a memorandum outlining his
         thoughts in January, and in February Justice Jackson wrote out
         his ideas in a lengthy draft opinion. He began: "The race
         problem would be quickly solved if some way could be found to
         make us all live up to our hypocrisies." Jackson discussed the
         history of racism from the legislative and judicial
         perspective and found no acceptable justification for revising
         the pattern. He finally concluded that segregation should be
         forcefully put to rest simply because the black population,
         not the Constitution, had changed.</p>
         <p>Barrett Prettyman read Jackson's memorandum and wrote a
         thoughtful reply. Of Prettyman's work, Kluger wrote: "It is
         doubtful if any of the many excellent young men who have come
         fresh out of the law schools or soon thereafter to serve the
         Justices of the Supreme Court ever served more faithfully or
         usefully than Barrett Prettyman served Justice Jackson. What
         part Prettyman's memo played will never be known, but it is a
         fact that Jackson, having written this much on the segregation
         cases, wrote no more."(691)</p>
         <p>Justice Jackson had a heart attack about seven weeks before
         the decision in 
         <title render="italic">Brown</title>was handed down in the
         spring of 1954. During his subsequent extended
         hospitalization, Prettyman brought work for him to review,
         including Chief Justice Warren's draft opinion in 
         <title render="italic">Brown</title>and Justice Frankfurter's
         colorful and verbose reports of the justices' conferences.
         Despite his poor health, Jackson was on the bench on May 17
         when the unanimous 
         <title render="italic">Brown</title>decision was handed
         down.</p>
         <p>During the summer of 1954 Chief Justice Warren appointed
         six clerks to study and report ways that desegregation might
         be implemented. Prettyman, a member of this team, was assigned
         to map out Spartanburg, South Carolina, in terms of its black
         and white population and to suggest a prototypical plan for
         integrating its schools; other clerks were given similar
         assignments. They then pooled their ideas to formulate an
         approach the Supreme Court should take on implementation of
         integration, but could not agree on the important question of
         timing. Prettyman favored a compromise between forcing
         immediate desegregation and allowing communities an indefinite
         period of time to act.</p>
         <p>Justice Jackson died in the fall of 1954, and Prettyman
         went to work for Justice Frankfurter, who had the highest
         praise for the young man's work and clearly took a personal
         interest in him. John Marshall Harlan, a judge on the U.S.
         Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, was nominated in
         November 1954 to take Jackson's place on the Court. Harlan's
         mere name put Senate conservatives on guard because his
         grandfather had been the sole dissenter in 
         <title render="italic">Plessy v. Ferguson</title>;
         consequently his nomination was held up in the Senate for four
         months. In the interim he invited Prettyman to be one of his
         first two clerks, and Prettyman accepted.</p>
         <p>At the conclusion of his clerkship in the early summer of
         1955, Barrett Prettyman joined the Washington, D.C. firm of
         Hogan and Hartson, where he is now a partner.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The papers of E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr. consist of
         correspondence files dating from 1944 to 1982, as well as the
         working papers from his clerkship for Justices Jackson,
         Frankfurter and Harlan (1953-1955).</p>
         <p>Prettyman had arranged the correspondence by name of the
         justice who was the correspondent/subject. For each man there
         is correspondence from Prettyman's clerkship period and later
         correspondence with other former clerks about reunions. In
         addition, the Jackson correspondence contains a few letters
         from Jackson and a good many related to his death. In the
         Frankfurter file there are many short, handwritten notes from
         Frankfurter to his clerk commenting on cases before the Court
         as they were being heard, making requests, or expressing
         opinions about other justices' views. Frankfurter's notes are
         also sprinkled throughout the case materials. The Harlan
         letters date from the period just before he went on the Court
         until the time of his death, since Justice and Mrs. Harlan
         maintained their friendship with Prettyman and his wife Evelyn
         after the short clerkship ended.</p>
         <p>The working papers contain one or more folders on a dozen
         specific cases, several folders on an assortment of cases, and
         twelve folders containing Prettyman's certiorari petition
         memoranda annotated by the three justices. Of the case
         material, the most significant concerns 
         <title render="italic">Brown v. Board of Education</title>and
         includes drafts of Prettyman's memoranda to Jackson regarding
         the justice's draft opinion, the map of Spartanburg,
         Prettyman's memo concerning implementation, and signed copies
         of the opinion and the decree.</p>
         <p>This collection documenting the work of a Supreme Court law
         clerk is significant because of the stature of the three
         justices Prettyman clerked for at such an important time in
         the Court's history. Furthermore, records of Supreme Court
         clerkships are rare. Legal historians of the 
         <title render="italic">Brown</title>era will find these papers
         valuable and interesting.</p>
