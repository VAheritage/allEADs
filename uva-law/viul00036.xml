         <p>Garrard Glenn was born in Atlanta, Georgia on 17 August
         1878. His parents were Helen Garrard and John Thomas Glenn, a
         veteran of the Civil War. Garrard received his B.A. in 1899
         from the University of Georgia where he was a member of Phi
         Beta Kappa and Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He went to Columbia Law
         School from which he received an LL.B. in 1903; while a
         student there he served on the editorial board of the 
         <emph render="italic">Columbia Law Review</emph>with John M.
         Woolsey, founder of the journal. Upon graduating he worked
         five years for Davies, Stone and Auerbach in New York. He then
         helped establish the firm of Shattuck and Glenn.</p>
         <p>In 1913 Glenn began lecturing at Columbia and continued
         there as a part-time associate professor until 1921. He had
         devised a course called Creditors' Rights which so impressed
         the Columbia faculty that they hired him to teach it. In early
         1927 Glenn turned down the offer of a teaching position at the
         University of Virginia Law School, but in December he decided
         to accept. He was the James Monroe Professor of Law from 1929
         until his death in 1949. Glenn, a well-loved and respected
         professor, taught Trusts, Equity, Corporations, Evidence,
         Creditors' Rights, Security and Insurance.</p>
<p>Garrard Glenn's prolific writing career began while he was a student and extended through the years of ill-health preceding his death.  In 1910 he published <emph render="italic">Secret Liens</emph> and in 1915, <emph render="italic">Creditors' Rights</emph>, a major work in an area of the law which he helped bring into focus.  World War I prompted him to write <emph render="italic">The Army and the Law</emph>, and in 1931 he published <emph render="italic">Fraudulent Conveyances</emph>.  Naturally after he began teaching Glenn had more time for scholarship, and in the thirties and forties his most respected works were written.  <emph render="italic">Glenn on Liquidation</emph> appeared in 1935, and the three-volume work, <emph render="italic">Glenn on Mortgages</emph>, was published in 1943.  His first casebook, <emph render="italic">Cases on Creditors' Rights</emph> came out in 1940, as did a revised edition of <emph render="italic">Fraudulent Conveyances</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Cases on Equity</emph>, co-authored with Kenneth Redden, appeared in 1946.  He served as editorial adviser for <emph render="italic">Jurisprudence in Virginia and West Virginia</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Restatement of the Law of Security</emph>.  Glenn produced more than 40 major articles for law reviews across the country and covered topics from creditors' rights to Sir Thomas More, whom he felt should be the patron saint of his profession.  While at the University, he served on the faculty committee of the <emph render="italic">Virginia Quarterly Review</emph> and was a faculty advisor to the <emph render="italic">Virginia Law Review</emph>.</p>
<p>In 1909 Glenn married Rosa Aubrey Wood, and they had two sons, Garrard W. and John Forsyth, both of whom received law degrees at the University of Virginia; the sons are often referred to as "Fox" and "Rab", respectively, in the correspondence.  The Glenns lived at "Spring Hill" in Ivy, and Glenn did most of his writing in the library of his home.  He enjoyed collecting rare books for his personal library and often advised alumni and Frances Farmer about purchases of rare items for the Law Library.</p>
