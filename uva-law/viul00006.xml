         <abstract label="Abstract">The journals of William Minor Lile
         were written between 1882-1932. He wrote regularly during the
         years 1882-1883 when he was establishing a law practice in
         Lynchburg, Virginia, and then ceased consistent writing when
         he joined the law faculty at the University of Virginia. When
         he resumed writing in 1918, he was dean of the law department.
         The journals are especially valuable for their impressions of
         life at the University of Virginia between
         1918-1932.</abstract>

         <p>William Minor Lile, who was born in Alabama in 1859, earned
         his LL.B. from the University of Virginia in 1882 and
         practiced law in Lynchburg before joining the law faculty in
         1893. Lile's uncle, John Barbee Minor, had served as
         unofficial head of the Law School since 1845, and when Minor
         died in 1895, Lile assumed the role. He was not an advocate of
         the case method, the late-nineteenth-century innovation in
         legal education, but his lecture-and-textbook method of
         teaching was nonetheless effective, and his students loved
         him. After the University appointed its first president, Edwin
         A. Alderman, in 1904, Lile became the first dean of the Law
         School.</p>
         <p>During Lile's term the Law School underwent greater changes
         than at any other period. Thanks to his persistent leadership,
         the required length of the law course was extended to two and
         eventually three years, and the admission requirement
         increased from a high school diploma to two years of college.
         Because Virginia did not adopt these higher standards as
         rapidly as other law schools, this school was not a charter
         member of the Association of American Law Schools, but
         Virginia did gain membership in 1915. The year Lile joined the
         faculty there were 139 law students, and by his retirement
         there were 257. In 1920 the first women students were admitted
         to the Law School, and in 1923 Elizabeth Tompkins became the
         first woman to earn and LL.B. Lile oversaw the construction of
         Minor Hall, the Law School's first building which opened in
         1911, as well as Clark Hall which opened in 1932. During his
         deanship the faculty grew from three to five as the curriculum
         greatly expanded. As soon as Clark Hall opened, Lile, age 73,
         retired. He died in 1935.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection of eleven bound, handwritten journals date
         from 1882 to 1932. Lile began keeping a journal when he was
         struggling to establish himself in law practice in Lynchburg
         and to woo the Methodist minister's young daughter, Maud
         Carson. He wrote regularly until he began teaching law at the
         University. At that point he stopped for about twenty-five
         years and resumed near the end of World War I. For the most
         part the journals are focused more intently on Lile's personal
         and family life than on law practice or teaching. The later
         volumes, however, provide invaluable vignettes on the Law
         School and University life in the 1920s and early 1930s.</p>
