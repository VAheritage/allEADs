         <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
         <p>John B. Minor was born in 1813 in Louisa County, Virginia,
         and educated by well-read family at home. At age seventeen he
         went off to Kenyon College in Ohio to study moral and natural
         philosophy. Dissatisfied there, he left after a year and
         enrolled at the University of Virginia in 1831 where, over the
         next three years, he studied ancient and modern languages,
         mathematics, chemistry, and law. His parents and older brother
         were strongly supportive of his studies and encouraged him to
         be a disciplined and serious-minded student. He, like only
         eight other law students from a total of forty-four, passed
         the final examinations and graduated in 1834. During his
         college years Minor also found time to tutor Professor Davis's
         children and to fall in love with his future wife, Davis's
         sister, Martha.</p>
         <p>After graduation Minor practiced law in Botetourt County
         and Charlottesville, but he was quite eager to give up
         practice to try teaching when he learned in 1845 that the
         University's Board of Visitors was searching for a law
         professor. Their first choice turned them down, and on July
         29, the Board appointed thirty-two year old Minor to the
         professorship.</p>
         <p>In October Minor began teaching and rigorously followed the
         traditional curriculum. Student notes indicate that his
         Blackstone lectures followed Davis's in plan and emphasis. His
         first innovation was the moot court which provided students a
         structured introduction to local, state and federal practice.
         Enrollment in Minor's classes was low at first, dropping to
         eighteen his second year, and then rising to sixty-one by
         1850. In the spring of 1851 Minor received a letter from James
         P. Holcombe, a legal scholar from Cincinnati, who wrote Minor
         that he had a great interest in teaching at the University if
         an adjunct professorship could be created for him. Minor
         explained to the Board of Visitors that he found the current
         teaching arrangement "far short of satisfying my own ideas of
         what is to be desired," since he felt the curriculum was too
         wide for one person to cover. Holcombe accepted the light
         teaching load and low salary initially offered by the
         University and began teaching in October 1851. Within a year
         the two men had revised the curriculum and the number of
         students enrolled in law steadily climbed through the 1850s.
         As he had proposed, Holcombe enhanced the curriculum by
         offering expanded lectures in commercial and civil law, as
         well as equity. Minor concentrated on common and statute
         law.</p>
         <p>By 1860 Minor and Holcombe had 142 students. The following
         year Holcombe, an outspoken advocate of secession, resigned to
         run for the state legislature, and Minor carried on alone
         during the war with just five or six students per year. In
         1866 Stephen O. Southall, who had studied law under John A.G.
         Davis and practiced ever since in Prince Edward County, was
         hired to replace Holcombe. By 1867 there were over one hundred
         law students once again, a post-war boost in enrollment the
         Law School would also experience in the twentieth century.
         After the war the number of graduates also rose. Soon after
         the war Minor worked closely with officials in Richmond to set
         up the state's first free public education system. His
         dedication to this long overdue legislation testifies to
         Minor's commitment to the widest possible education. We may
         assume that these efforts grew in part from his concern over
         University students' lack of preparation.</p>
         <p>In 1875 Minor published the first two volumes of the 
         <title render="italic">Institutes of Common and Statute
         Law</title>, followed quickly by volumes three and four. The
         publication of the 
         <title render="italic">Institutes</title>was certainly one of
         the high points of Minor's career and established him as the
         leading legal scholar in the South. Always enterprising, Minor
         in his late fifties started a private summer law course
         designed as an introduction for novices and a refresher for
         practicing lawyers. Immensely popular, this course attracted
         scores of students each summer. After the post- war boom, the
         number of regular law students dropped a bit but then steadied
         to an average of 83 per class between 1875 and 1895. About 30%
         of those students were awarded LL.B. degrees.</p>
         <p>Stephen Southall died suddenly in 1884 and was succeeded by
         James H. Gilmore the following year. By this time Minor was in
         his seventies. Although he would continue to teach year-round
         until the end, he was slowing down. As soon as his sons, John
         B., Jr. and Raleigh, passed their law exams in the early
         1890s, they were hired to assist their father in his classes.
         Minor's fiftieth year at the University was celebrated in
         early July of 1895, and he died later that same month.</p>
