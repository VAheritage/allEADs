         attorneys, especially Henry A. Barling and A.H. Davis. Between
         1870 and 1876 Crapo and others were seeking restitution for
         their clients before the Court of Commissioners of Alabama
         Claims in Washington. Additional correspondents include
         members of Congress, administration officials, and clients
         whose ships and goods were destroyed by Confederate cruisers
         during the Civil War.</abstract>

         <p>After the Civil War the United States sought restitution
         from Great Britain which, despite its neutrality, had allowed
         Confederate cruisers bent on destroying U.S. commerce to come
         and go from its ports during the war. The U.S. government and
         private citizens claimed millions of dollars of damage and
         loss at the hand of these cruisers. The Treaty of Washington,
         signed by the U.S. and Britain in early 1871, among other
         things, provided for arbitration of these claims. In the fall
         of that year, representatives of the two countries went to
         Geneva to argue their cases before an international
         arbitration tribunal, the first of its kind. The United
         States' case was argued by former Assistant Secretary of State
         Bancroft Davis, along with lawyers Caleb Cushing, William M.
         Evarts, and Morrison R. Waite, under the direction of
         Secretary of State Hamilton Fish and Secretary of Treasury
         George Boutwell. On the tribunal were Charles Francis Adams
         representing the U.S., Chief Justice Sir Alexander Cockburn of
         Great Britain, along with arbitrators from Brazil, Italy, and
         Switzerland. At the conclusion, Great Britain agreed to pay
         the U.S. the $15,500,000 (&#163;3,200,00) awarded by the
         tribunal to cover the depredations of the cruisers 
         <title render="italic">Alabama, Florida,</title>and 
         <title render="italic">Shenandoah</title>.</p>
         <p>Bancroft Davis and members of the cabinet had originally
         hoped to recover far more from Great Britain than the amount
         of loss directly attributable to the cruisers. They had wanted
         to hold the British liable for losses in commerce, hikes in
         insurance rates, and even the general costs of a protracted
         war. The tribunal was not sympathetic to this side of the U.S.
         case, and subsequently, individual claimants feared that the
         government would try to withhold some of the award for the
         ailing treasury. Congress, however, favored the claimants and,
         soon after the arbitration award was made, established a Court
         of Commissioners of Alabama Claims in Washington to handle
         individuals' cases.</p>
         <p>The letters in this collection were written to William W.
         Crapo, a lawyer in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Crapo, educated
         at Yale College and Harvard Law School, began practicing law
         when he was twenty-five. That same year he became city
         solicitor and the following year, representative to the
         General Court. He was also active in politics, serving three
         terms in Congress and running unsuccessfully several times as
         the Republican candidate for governor of Massachusetts. By
         Crapo's fortieth year, 1870, when this correspondence begins,
         he was a prominent figure in legal, business, and political
         circles in his state. Along with other New Bedford lawyers
         Charles R. Tucker and George C. Crocker, Crapo was beginning
         to prepare claims for a number of New England "Sufferers,"
         principally whalers, who had lost property to or incurred
         damage because of the Confederate cruisers' actions. In
         addition Crapo worked closely with New York lawyers Henry A.
         Barling and A. H. Davis, who were partners, as well as Charles
         C. Beaman, Jr.</p>
         <p>Beaman, formerly private secretary to Massachusetts Senator
         Charles Sumner, published 
         <title render="italic">The National and Private "Alabama
         Claims: and Their "Final and Amicable Settlement""</title>in
         March of 1871, and early the following year was sent to Geneva
         to assist Bancroft Davis in arguing the U.S. case by gathering
         and presenting evidence of the claims. The association of
         Crapo, Barling and Davis with Beaman was critical to the
         preparation of their clients' claims, as well as to their
         tactical lobbying efforts in Washington between the time of
         the award and the creation of the Claims Commission.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection consists of over one hundred letters
         concerning the 
         <title render="italic">Alabama</title>claims cases. Written to
         William Crapo between 1870 and 1876, the letters provide a
         detailed view of the lawyers' legal and political efforts to
         secure restitution for their clients. Crapo's principal
         correspondents were lawyers Barling and Davis who wrote him
         over fifty letters between December of 1870 and February of
         1873. Of particular interest are the letters written in late
         1872 regarding the lawyers' efforts to influence members of
         the administration and Congress to ensure that the full award
         went to the claimants. The names of George Boutwell, Caleb
         Cushing, Bancroft Davis, William Evarts, Hamilton Fish,
         Ulysses Grant, among others, appear in their letters to Crapo.
         Additional correspondents include other lawyers working on
         similar cases, bankers, insurance officials, and individuals,
         some poor and poorly educated, who had suffered great
         losses.</p>
