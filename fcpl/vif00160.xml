<head>Historical and Biographical Information</head>
<p>In July 1945, the Virginia Soil Conservation Committee approved the establishment of the Northern Virginia Soil Conservation District which included Loudoun, Prince William and Fairfax counties. Those three counties voted for its creation in a referendum held on April 26, 1945. Renamed the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District (NVSWCD) on July 1, 1964, it was established to develop a public understanding of the need for planning and action to preserve natural resources; to encourage landowners to use the most effective practices and procedures in the conservation of soil and natural resources; and to assist landowners and operators with conservation. The District was also concerned about the consequences of erosion, flooding and sedimentation caused by the sudden increase in land development and construction.</p>
<p>A board of five supervisors directed the work of the District assisted by professional personnel of the Soil Conservation Service of the Department of Agriculture. The offices were originally located in Manassas, then at 114 East Main Street at Fairfax Circle, and later in January 1970, the District moved to 3945 Chain Bridge Road in Fairfax. Today, its offices are in the Fairfax County Government Center.</p>
<p>Following World War II, the rural character of Fairfax County was rapidly changing due to the influx of people seeking housing and the related expansion of shopping centers, roads, schools, and recreation. The hasty development brought about staggering damage and destruction to many irreplaceable natural resources and it caused abundant soil and water conservation problems.</p>
<p>Originally orientated toward agriculture, the District undertook a pilot urban conservation program in Fairfax County beginning in July 1962, with the intent of minimizing and preventing further destruction. Glenn B. Anderson of the Soil Conservation Service was assigned to the District to assist with the pilot project over the next decade. Subsequently, the District undertook many initiatives including developing a conservation policy for the county, conducted field tours outlining major conservation problems and the techniques used to alleviate them, various planting projects, conducted environmental studies and assessments at the request of county agencies, provided consultation services, assisted farmers with conservation practices and projects, and provided conservation outreach to the public. The District celebrates 80 years of promoting soil and water conservation in Fairfax County in 2025.</p>

<head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District Photograph Collection contains 141 photographs and six negatives from 1962-1971. The images depict a quickly developing Fairfax County suffering from erosion and other environmental problems, and conservation efforts to combat them. The photographs were taken to increase public understanding of the conservation needs and problems in Fairfax County. Some of these images were originally published in the District’s annual reports and were mostly photographed by Glenn B. Anderson, the District Conservationist; Gordon S. Smith, an information specialist of the Soil Conservation Service based in Upper Darby, PA; and Clarence Deland, a field photographer for the Soil Conservation Service. Locations featured include Annandale, Burke, Centreville, Chantilly, Fairfax, Falls Church, McLean, Seven Corners, Springfield, Tysons Corner, and Vienna, VA.</p>
