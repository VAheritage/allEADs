<head>Historical and Biographical Information</head>
<p>On August 4, 1986, the Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County issued a proclamation establishing the Fairfax County Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution with the purpose of promoting the 200th anniversary of the drafting and ratification of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. The Board declared 1987-1991 as the Constitutional Bicentennial Commemoration Era and tapped the Commission to educate and inform the public about the founding constitutional documents, the significant role Fairfax County played in creating them, as well as the contributions of two distinguished Fairfax County residents, George Washington and George Mason. The Board of Supervisors appointed the initial Board of Directors, consisting of 24 individuals represented from various historical and institutional organizations in the county.</p>
<p>The Commission planned, developed, and coordinated observances and activities commemorating these historic events. They distributed free bumper stickers reading “Fairfax County, Home of the Bill of Rights” through the Fairfax County Office of Public Sales and local public libraries. The Commission created a traveling display recounting the story of Fairfax County as home to George Washington and George Mason through pictures and text. They also printed articles on George Mason in the Fairfax Chronicles and helped underwrite the publication of the book “George Mason and the Legacy of the Constitutional Liberty”.</p>
<p>The Commission manned a booth at the annual Fairfax Fair, where they featured their traveling display and passed out bumper stickers and pamphlets. In September 1989, the Commission contributed to the celebration of the Fairfax/French Alliance 1789-1989 held at Gunston Hall. The group also partnered with George Mason University on several projects including a “George Mason and the Bill of Rights” conference held on the college’s campus.</p>
<p>The Commission’s last initiative before disbanding in 1992 was a public ceremonial celebration of the 200th anniversary of the ratification of the Bill of Rights, which was observed at Gunston Hall on December 15, 1991.</p>
