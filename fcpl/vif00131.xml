<bioghist encodinganalog="545$a">
<head>Historical and Biographical Information</head>
<p>Henry Wirt Thomas was born in Leesburg, Virginia on October 20, 1812, to Margaret and John Henry Thomas. After studying law in a Washington, D.C. college, he taught school for a period, and moved to Fairfax Court House in 1833. In 1837, Thomas served as a Major in the Virginia Militia. At age 26, Thomas was selected as the Commonwealth’s Attorney, followed by his election to the House of Delegates for the 1841-1842 and 1847-1849 sessions. He went on to serve as the Fairfax County and Alexandria County representative in the Senate from 1850-1863, and from 1871-1875.</p>
<p>During the outbreak of the Civil War when the residents of Fairfax County deliberated on seceding, Thomas initially opposed secession, but later changed course. He is alleged to have stood in the Fairfax Courthouse’s doorway intimidating voters into voting for secession. After seceding, Thomas moved to Richmond and offered his services to President Jefferson Davis.</p>
<p>On April 5, 1865, Thomas was appointed to a committee of three to wait on President Abraham Lincoln and discussed with him how to reestablish civil government in Virginia. On August 12, 1867, Thomas, then a judge of the Ninth Judicial Circuit of Virginia was arrested by the U.S. Grand Jury for violating the Civil Rights Bill. He had earlier refused to allow Jane Taylor, an African American, to testify in his court in May 1866. Despite this, he was elected as the 12th Lieutenant Governor of Virginia from 1875-1878, and continued to serve as a judge on the Fairfax County Circuit Court until shortly before his death in June 1890.</p>
