<head>Historical and Biographical Information</head>
<p>The Woman’s Club of Fairfax (WCF) was founded in 1956 and chartered under the General Federation of Women’s Clubs (GFWC). Throughout its existence, the club has provided service to the Fairfax community through volunteer activities and financial support. WCF created and maintains the Ford House Exhibit in the Ford Building in the City of Fairfax, VA and contributes volunteer services and financial support to the preservation and restoration of Fairfax historical properties, such as the Ratcliffe-Allison-Pozer House, built by the City of Fairfax’s founder Richard Ratcliffe and formerly known as Earp’s Ordinary and the Ratcliffe-Allison House. Each year, WCF grants an achievement scholarship to a local high school senior; designs, purchases, and sells a Fairfax commemorative Christmas ornament; and contributes funds and volunteer services to Fairfax cultural and civic events such as the Independence Day celebration and Chocolate Lovers Festival. The club regularly sponsors fundraising activities such as fashion shows, yard sales, and bake sales to support local, national, and international charities and causes, and hosts a number of social activities for its members. The club’s signature event was a popular annual antiques show, held from 1957-1972.</p>
