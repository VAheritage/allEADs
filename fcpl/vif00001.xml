<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The area now known as Annandale was home to an Indian village and
trading post until 1685, when Col. William Fitzhugh purchased the 22,000
acre tract from the original grantee, John Matthews. He named the tract
Ravensworth in honor of his family’s ancestral home in Yorkshire.
Fitzhugh brought in slaves and overseers to cultivate the land and also
leased parcels of it to Huguenot refugees.</p>

<p>The Fitzhughs built three notable mansions in the area during 1790s:
Oak Hill, Ossian Hall, and Ravensworth. William Fitzhugh built the
Ravensworth mansion which later came into the possession of the Lee
family. Robert E. Lee’s mother died in Ravensworth and later Lee’s wife
and family temporarily sought refuge there during the Civil War. The
house burned in 1926 due to an arsonist.</p>

<p>Nicholas Fitzhugh built Ossian Hall, which received many illustrious
guests including George Washington and George Mason. Long abandoned and
heavily damaged by vandals, the Annandale Fire Department burned the
house in a controlled fire practice drill to make way for a new
subdivision in 1957. Today, Ossian Hall is featured on the logo of the
Annandale Fire Department.</p>

<p>Around 1790 Richard Fitzhugh built Oak Hill. Edward and Jane Howrey
purchased the house in 1935 and had it restored. It is the only one of
the three houses which survives to this day and is listed on the
National Register of Historic Places.</p>

<p>With the completion of Little River Turnpike in 1811, a little white
toll house was erected on the road in Annandale. The toll house served
as a toll gate and polling place, where residents of the area later cast
votes in favor of secession.</p>

<p>By 1830, the community’s name changed to Annandale. The origin of the
name is subject for debate. One theory is Annandale earned its name from
a town in Scotland which is located along the Annan River. Another
belief is the name comes from Sir Robert de Brus, the “Earl of
Annandale” in Scotland. Regardless of the name’s source, the area
officially became known as Annandale when the first “Annandale Post
Office” opened in 1837.</p>

<p>The area saw some Civil War action as the site of several skirmishes.
The Union Army used the Annandale United Methodist Chapel as a temporary
headquarters before dismantling it for firewood and winter quarters.
Following the Civil War, the area remained fairly rural until the 20th
Century when Fairfax County became a popular place to live for D.C.
government employees. Starting in the late 1950s, developers bought the
remainder of the Ravensworth property and subdivided it for new homes
and shopping malls. The site of the Ravensworth mansion is now marked by
a Historical Marker.</p>
