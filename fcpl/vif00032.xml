<head>Historical and Biographical Information</head>
<p>Bayard Daniel Evans was born on February 1, 1900 in Scranton, Pa. to Daniel and Rachel Evans. After public schooling, he studied dairy husbandry at Pennsylvania State College and graduated in 1923. He funded his college studies with menial jobs as a cab driver, steward, and waiter. Evans developed an interested in the cafeteria business and later worked in a number of restaurant chains including the Automat in New York. By 1930, he managed a local Scranton cafeteria.</p>
<p>After marrying Ruth Nickell, the couple and their two children, Ralph and Caroline, moved to Northern Virginia. In 1939, Bayard and Ruth opened the Evans Coffee Shop in Arlington at 4770 Lee Highway with a $2,000 investment. Originally a 50 seat restaurant decorated with historical memorabilia, the coffee shop later expanded to 265 seats before closing in 1961. In 1951, the Evans’ also opened the Evans Cafeteria in the District at 2023 I Street, N.W. although it was short-lived.</p>
<p>In the early 1940s, Evans accumulated 43 acres of land in McLean and the family settled into an existing farmhouse on the property. In 1957, the couple commissioned local architect Walter Macomber to construct a restaurant on the family farm using materials from a number of historic buildings including old mills, barns, and churches. The new restaurant, “Evans Farm Inn”, opened for business in 1958.</p>
<p>Evans Farm Inn became a local McLean landmark. The farm operation on the property provided fresh vegetables, produce, and pure well water. Horses, ducks, goats, and other wildlife roamed the open farmland. In addition to the main dining room, the property contained a country store, a waterwheel and millhouse, a barn, a cookhouse built from old paving blocks from Georgetown, and the Sitting Duck Pub which had the atmosphere of a traditional British pub. The Evans’ enhanced the Colonial atmosphere of Evans Farm Inn with antiques and historical memorabilia, as well as plantation style food served by waiters dressed in Colonial apparel. A host of celebrities, politicians, and royalty visited the restaurant over the years. After Bayard’s death, Maria and Ralph Evans continued running the restaurant until 1999, when Evans sold the family farm to townhouse developers.</p>
<p>In addition to restaurateur, Bayard Evans was very active in civic affairs. He was a Charter member of the McLean Business and Professional Association, Charter member of the Fairfax Hunt, Founder of the McLean Kiwanis Club, Founder of the McLean Horse Show, Past President of Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce, Past President of the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington, Treasurer of the McLean Citizens Association, and a member of the Virginia State Restaurant Association. In 1965, the National Restaurant Association chose Evans as “Restaurateur of the Year”.</p>
<p>As evidenced by his collection of antiques and historical memorabilia, Evans had a tremendous passion for local history. Concerned about historic preservation, he founded the Fairfax Landmark Preservation Committee, today known as the Fairfax County History Commission. He was a member of the Arlington and Fairfax County Historical Societies, as well as a member of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. He was also largely responsible for saving and restoring Colvin Run Mill, Dranesville Tavern and other historical landmarks in the area.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of September 7, 1980, Evans and his wife were traveling northbound on Utterback Store Road when his car collided with another at the Georgetown Pike intersection. Their car overturned pinning down Ruth who later recovered, but fatally injured Bayard. </p>
