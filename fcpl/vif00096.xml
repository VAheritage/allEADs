<head>Historical and Biographical Information</head>
<p>In October 1969, Robert E. “Eddie” Wagstaff established the Sully Foundation Ltd. to promote and support the preservation and interpretation of the Sully Historic Site, also known as Sully Plantation. Henry Lee I purchased the plantation in 1725, and gave it to his son, Richard Bland Lee, in 1794. Several families lived on the plantation until the Fairfax County Park Authority acquired the site in 1959, saving it from demolition during the construction of Dulles International Airport.</p>
<p>Wagstaff, who was largely instrumental in saving Sully from destruction, formed the Sully Foundation to promote the site’s educational value and to maintain, further develop, and restore the house. The Foundation sought to use Sully for educational purposes by providing tours and encouraging visitors. The organization also sought to restore and furnish the plantation and its grounds through the solicitation of financial gifts and donations of artifacts. The Foundation consisted of a directorate of six to fifteen persons of which Wagstaff named the original group. Wagstaff died only a few months after he donated his life’s savings to create the Sully Foundation in August 1970.</p>
<p>In 1971, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors expressed a desire to publish a manuscript on the history of Sully Plantation. The Fairfax County Office of Comprehensive Planning appointed Robert S. Gamble to prepare a study which resulted in the 1974 publication of the book “Sully: The Biography of a House”. The Sully Foundation supported and underwrote the book’s publication and later received publication rights for it. Gamble’s book is now widely regarded as the definitive study on Sully Plantation.</p>
<p>In 1996, the Fairfax County Park Authority erected a plaque in front of Sully in commemoration of the Sully Foundation’s many years of service towards preserving the house.</p>
