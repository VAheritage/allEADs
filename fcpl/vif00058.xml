<head>Historical and Biographical Information</head>
<p>Melinda Elizabeth Pitman grew up in Falls Church, Virginia and attended Devonshire Elementary School and Whittier Intermediate School. From 1968-1971, Pittman attended Falls Church High School and participated in the drama program under the direction of George Robert Allen. She partook in over twenty school plays and was an honor thespian. After graduating, Pittman studied theatre at Virginia Tech, Tulane University, and went on to have an active career in Portland, Oregon as a singer-songwriter, composer, and performer. She wrote and directed seven original full-length musicals and in 1999, wrote and composed “Wonderbroads” which won the Oregon Book Award for Best Drama. Pittman founded the non-profit touring company BroadArts Theatre, which creates original musical plays celebrating the impact of women and minorities.</p>
