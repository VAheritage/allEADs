<head>Historical and Biographical Information</head>
<p>Frederick (Fred) J. McCoy grew up in Queens, New York, and graduated from Andrew Jackson High School in New York City in 1947. After graduating from high school, he worked as a machinist from 1947 to 1949, and then as a purchasing agent from 1949 to 1951. He served in the U.S. Army from 1951 to 1953, after being honorably discharged, returned to work as a purchasing agent from 1953 to 1958. McCoy attended the Pratt Institute (1948-1951) and Long Island University (1954-1958) and graduated from Georgetown University School of Dentistry with his Doctor of Dental Surgery degree in 1962. Upon graduation, he moved to the City of Fairfax and opened a dental practice based in his home that he ran until retiring in 2006.</p>
<p>McCoy was elected to the City of Fairfax City Council for the 1972-1974, 1974-1976, and 1976-1978 terms. During the 1972 and 1974 elections, McCoy was elected as part of the “Fairfax Citizens for a Livable City” slate of candidates, who promoted balancing commercial development with preserving the residential character of the city and encouraged citizen participation in the government. Critical issues during the 1976 election included bond referendums for $1.75 million in capital improvements at two city elementary schools as well as city transportation and a gas tax to pay for Northern Virginia’s Metro bus costs. McCoy opposed paying the full Metro deficit, believing it outweighed the service and benefits the city received. He also opposed the school bonds as being “extravagant” and potentially requiring a raise in taxes. McCoy was defeated in his bid for reelection in 1978. A critical issue during the 1978 election was whether the city would maintain a contract with Fairfax County to remain within the county school system or establish a separate city school system. All of the candidates who supported an independent school system, including McCoy, were defeated. During his time on the City Council, McCoy served on the Council of Governments Transportation Planning Board, the Committee on Drug Abuse, and the Storm Drainage Committee. McCoy unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 1980 with a campaign theme of “Let’s Talk City!” focused on open and transparent government and informed citizens.</p>
