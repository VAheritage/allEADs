<bioghist encodinganalog="545$a">
<head>Historical and Biographical Information</head>
<p>James Monroe Love Jr. was born on February 12, 1875 in Fairfax, Virginia to Maria and Judge James M. Love Sr. (1842-1933). His father, a son of Thomas R. Love, was a judge of the courts at Fairfax County and Alexandria. He also was a Confederate Civil War veteran and fought with the “Black Horse” Fourth Virginia Calvary. Love was a founder of the Marr Camp of Confederate Veterans of Fairfax County.</p>
<p>On February 15, 1879, Judge James M. Love purchased from the heirs of E.R. Ford 10.5 acres of land adjacent to Truro Church containing Coombe Cottage. In 1845, Dr. Frederick Baker had purchased this same tract of land and built a collection of buildings including a residence and a private school for young women. He named the academy Coombe Cottage which operated until the Civil War. Love resided there for over 50 years, and Coombe Cottage became known locally as the “Love House”. Love died at the home of his other son, Thomas B. Love, at 1925 S Street, NW at age 91 on June 12, 1933.</p>
<p>After Love’s death, the chancery case Love v. Love forced the sale of the property. On November 13, 1945, Lyman B. Kirkpatrick, Jr. (1916-1995) purchased the Love House for $18,000. The sale included original furnishings and other belongings of Judge Love’s, of which the three books found in this collection were included. In 1955, the Kirkpatricks sold the property, and developers demolished Coombe Cottage in 1962 to make way for the Mosby Apartments, presently known as Mosby Tower at 10560 Main Street.</p>
<p>On March 17, 1898, James M. Love Jr. married Rebecca Fowle Daingerfield of whom he had two daughters with. He joined up with the U.S. Army and was appointed a Second Lieutenant with the 21st Infantry in September 1898. On October 8, 1899, he was appointed as a First Lieutenant of the 5th Infantry and went on to fight in the Spanish-American War. He was severely wounded in the right arm while serving with General Henry Ware Lawton near Manila in the Philippines.</p>
<p>After the war, Love returned home and in 1899 saw duty as adjutant general of the District of Columbia National Guard with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. On July 16, 1900, he applied and later received permission to be relieved of that assignment desiring to see active service in China due to the Boxer Rebellion. He was transferred to the 21st Infantry on February 27, 1902. Afterwards, he attended the Infantry and Calvary School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas where he studied law and graduated in 1905. He received the rank of Captain of the 15th Infantry on August 21, 1905.</p>
<p>During World War I, he was in command of the 3rd Officers Training Camp at Camp Lee (now Fort Lee) in Prince George County, Virginia. He saw action on the French front, and served as a Lieutenant-Colonel in the 318th Infantry and commanded Fairfax County soldiers in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Upon returning home from World War I, Love was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his meritorious service with the U.S. Army in France.</p>
<p>Love went on to attend the Army War College at Washington. After his graduation, the Army assigned him to be an instructor at the Fort Leavenworth, Kansas army college in August 1921. Love finished his career at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, and he received orders to retire in October 1922. After retiring, he moved to the Far East, and married for a second time on January 6, 1927, to Elizabeth A. “Bessie” Tobin.</p>
<p>During World War II, the Japanese captured him while living in Manila, Philippines and placed him in an internment camp. He was released in February 1945, and returned to the United States in May, living at the Army and Navy Club until his death on March 18, 1957 at Walter Reed Army Hospital. He is buried near his father at the Fairfax City Cemetery. </p>
