<head>Historical and Biographical Information</head>
<p>Ruth Katherine Doehrman was born in Elizabeth, N.J. on December 10, 1910.</p>
<p>She was a ballet dancer in New York as well as a member of the Elizabeth, N.J. Dramatic Club. She married Paul Peter, a Washington D.C. native and research director for the National Association of Broadcasters. The couple had two children, Suzanne and Paul B. Peter, and settled down in Falls Church, Va. in 1938.</p>
<p>“Snip”, as she was called by her friends, led an active life in community affairs. She taught ballet and ballroom dancing to local students and performed in Falls Church Community Theater shows. She founded the Tuesday Afternoon Club, Fairfax Christmas Ball, and served as president of the Garden Club of Fairfax as well as a board member on the Garden Club of Virginia. “Snip” also sung in the choir of Truro Episcopal Church in Fairfax, acted as a founder and vestry member of the Church of the Apostles in Fairfax, and served as a member of St. John’s Episcopal Church in Centreville.</p>
<p>The Peter family frequently appeared in the society sections of local newspapers. “Snip” also wrote as a columnist for the Northern Virginia Sun’s Woman’s Page.</p>
<p>In 1958, “Snip” opened her own pre-school, Greenwood School, on Orchard Drive in Fairfax, Va. running it until the late 1960s. Her husband, Paul, also became a teacher, teaching social studies at Fairfax High School (1951-1962) and Oakton High School (1968-1969). From 1962-1968 Paul acted as chief of the Fairfax Education Association which represented Fairfax County’s 5,200 teachers.</p>
