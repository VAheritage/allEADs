<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Anne Johnston Anderson was born in Rock Hill, South Carolina on April 23, 1914 
to John Wesley and Anne Luckey ‘Jenks’ Anderson. She attended Winthrop Training School 
and enrolled in Winthrop College where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in History 
and English. As a college student she organized the Roosevelt-Garner Club and the Young 
Democratic Club of York County and went on to be selected as the Young Democrats national 
committeewoman from South Carolina in 1933..</p>

<p>After graduating in 1934, she attended George Washington Law School. While studying 
there she met Donald Wilkins, an assistant dean and roll-keeper for one of her classes. 
They married on September 4, 1937. In 1938 she graduated with her L.L.B. while her husband 
received his Master’s degree in the same ceremony. That same year she also passed the District 
of Columbia Bar.</p>

<p>In 1939 the Wilkins family moved to Fairfax County living in a small house in Lee Boulevard
 Heights. Anne Wilkins lived the life of a housewife, raising their two children, Gary and John. 
In 1943 the Wilkins’ bought and moved into Munson Hill. The house, built in 1859, saw many 
encounters between Confederate and Union forces during the Civil War, including J.E.B Stuart’s 
occupation of the hill. .</p>

<p>The public health situation of Fairfax County stimulated Wilkins’ involvement in politics. 
Her children attended a local school and she felt the health department did not give enough 
attention to communicable disease control. Wilkins met with the local public health officer 
to raise her concerns, and he inspired her to organize citizen support for public health facilities. 
As a result, she founded the Lay Health Association which sought to broaden the scope of the 
health department. </p>

<p>Wilkins went on to become very active in civic affairs. In 1941 she and her husband helped 
found the Fairfax County Federation of Citizens Association. She also worked bringing about 
community change with the Community Chest, the League of Women Voters, the Good Government 
Committee and the PTA. </p>

<p>In 1947 the County Board proposed rezoning land near Seven Corners for the construction 
of Willston Apartments, a large unwanted apartment complex that would dramatically increase 
the community’s population. With plenty of support, Anne Wilkins led the opposition to the rezoning. 
Nevertheless, the County Board rezoned it, and this defeat inspired Wilkins to get more involved 
with politics to instigate change. </p>

<p>In 1950, Anne and Donald acted as leaders in the campaign to change the inefficient form of the 
county government. Under the old form, voters separately elected all heads of government, the county 
suffered a lack of budget control, and the government was unprepared for the rapid influx of population 
in the area. Through their involvement with the Federation of Citizens Association and League of 
Women Voters, they successfully won this campaign. On November 5, 1950 Fairfax County voters approved 
the county executive form of government to be implemented in 1952.</p>

<p>In 1951 with the help of the League of Women Voters, Wilkins set up a grassroots campaign to 
get her elected to the Board of Supervisors. She successfully acquired the Democratic nomination for
 supervisor in the Falls Church District over incumbent C.B. Runyon. She went on to win the general 
election over Republican Frank Clem, which made her the only woman board member in Virginia at that 
time. In 1955 she ran for reelection in the Mason District defeating Republican James L. Deaver, and 
again in 1959. In 1958, she served as the board’s first female chairman and again in 1960 and 1961. 
She lost her campaign for a fourth term in 1963 to Republican Stanford E. Parris.</p>

<p>Wilkins accomplished a tremendous amount of progress in her twelve years on the Board and is credited
 for single-handedly shaping the direction of Fairfax County’s growth and development. During her first 
year on the Board in 1952, Wilkins oversaw the implementation of the county executive form of government. 
During the change, elected officials transitioned into appointed offices.</p>

<p>As one of the first advocates for a countywide master plan, she immediately initiated the master plan 
studies which resulted in the county’s first long-range Master Plan for land use. The Master Plan formed 
the basis for all future development in the county. While on the board, she planned and built a county-wide 
sewer and water system, set up modern county police and fire departments, provided garbage collecting services, 
and created guidelines for storm drainage. She helped build modern schools, improved school standards, aided 
in the formation of George Mason University, and successfully led Fairfax County through integration despite 
substantial resistance. In addition to setting up a modern public health department and constructing new clinics,
 Wilkins helped establish Fairfax Hospital, the county’s first hospital. Wilkins also fought a losing battle for
 annexation of the City of Fairfax.</p>

<p>Wilkins served on the Planning Commission and involved herself in many land-use and zoning issues. 
She convinced the federal government of moving the proposed metropolitan area airport from Burke to Chantilly. 
The government had already purchased the land in Burke for the construction of the airport, despite major protest 
from the community. After consulting soil scientists, Wilkins discovered that Burke had insufficient soil and 
an abundant amount of granite that would be costly to remove for construction of runway foundations. The 
Chantilly location had adequate soil and constructing an airport would prove to be immensely more economical. 
While the government later cited the traffic pattern for moving the airport to Chantilly, her argument convinced 
the government enough to cease pursuing the Burke location and re-evaluate their plans. She later successfully 
lobbied for a sufficient right of way for the Dulles Toll Road.</p>

<p>While on the Board of Supervisors, Wilkins also acted as a charter member of the Washington Metropolitan
 Regional Conference, now known as the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. She served on several 
of its committees including Transportation in which she laid the groundwork for future development of the 
Metro. While on the Water Supply and Pollution Abatement Committee, she succeeded in cleaning up the Potomac 
River and adopted water quality standards.</p>

<p>When she lost the 1963 election, Wilkins drifted away from politics. She became a real estate broker with 
Edward R. Carr, Inc. handling Carr’s land and commercial sales in Springfield and Annandale. In 1972 she started 
her own real estate business, Anne Wilkins and Associates, and went on to make a major land sale that became the 
planned community of Lake Ridge in Prince William County.</p>

<p>After leaving politics, her family suffered multiple tragedies. In 1966, the Alexandria Federal Court 
convicted Donald Wilkins of income tax evasion. Accused of submitting fraudulent tax returns that cheated 
the government out of almost $23,000, Wilkins served a brief prison sentence. Anne had filed joint returns 
with her husband but the government did not charge her with misconduct. In 1977, Wilkins’ son, John, died 
suddenly of an aneurysm at age 33. Anne retired from her business in 1993 and moved to Merry Point, Virginia. 
She died at her home of breast cancer on September 9, 1996.</p>
