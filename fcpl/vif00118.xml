<head>Historical and Biographical Information</head>
<p>In 1851, the Orange &#38; Alexandria Railroad established Fairfax Station. A small community mostly of Irish immigrants grew up around this railroad depot and built Saint Mary of Sorrows Catholic Church in 1858. The community saw several skirmishes during the Civil War. Following the Second Battle of Bull Run, Clara Barton established her headquarters at St. Mary’s to treat wounded soldiers. The village was renamed Swetnam in 1897, and reverted back to Fairfax Station in 1921. The Southern Railroad closed Fairfax Station in 1973, which at the time was the last operating railroad station in Fairfax County. In 1981, volunteers spearheaded by Lena Wyckoff dismantled the old station and rebuilt it on a new property where it opened in 1987 as the Fairfax Station Railroad Museum.</p>

<head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The Fairfax Station, Virginia Collection consists of 0.25 linear feet spanning the years 1861-1911. Included is an 1861 Bank of the Old Dominion (Alexandria, Va.) check made out to J.H. Wright and Son by C.M. Schroffe of Fairfax Station. Also included are Mutual Fire Insurance of Fairfax County Policy papers for Mrs. Mary E. Malcom, a widowed farmer who lived in Stoneleigh, Virginia. Stoneleigh was a small postal village located on Ox Road near Silverbrook Road, in present day Fairfax Station, Virginia. The post office operated from 1885 to 1908 with David S. Beach as postmaster. All that remains of the village today is the Stoneleigh House, built in 1835 located at 8108 Ox Road. Papers include policies signed by M.D. Hall, who was the superintendent of Fairfax County Public Schools, and a National Bank of Fairfax postcard from 1908.</p>
