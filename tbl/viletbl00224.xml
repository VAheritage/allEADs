<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Mary Carter (1897-1 October 1944) was the daughter of Charles Shirley Carter, Jr. (1871-1949) and Bessie Bentley Carter (1860-1938). The family lived in Leesburg in the home of Carter's father, Charles Shirley Carter, Sr. (1840-1922), a physician. She attended the Misses Eastman's School for Girls in Washington, D.C.; she graduated in 1916. Carter spent much of her time at school in Washington and returned to Leesburg for summer and winter breaks. When home, she attended dances and parties with the other young people of Leesburg, many of whom also attended boarding schools.
</p>
<p>Carter moved permanently to Washington in her twenties, where she worked as a secretary in several government offices. She died in October 1944 and was buried in Union Cemetery, Leesburg.</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Mary Carter kept a scrapbook during 1914 and 1915, mostly during her summer and winter breaks. She called it "My good time book." In it, she collected newspaper notices and announcements of dances, parties, card games, and weddings. Carter often added notes about who attended the events, how late everyone stayed out, and other general comments. The book also includes place cards, invitations, programs, and calling cards. Though most of the material comes from her stays in Leesburg, there are several things from the Misses Eastman's School for Girls, including an invitation to a tea hosted by the class of 1915.
</p>
<p>The collection also includes a copy of "A Sketch, Richard Baxter Fishburne 1896-1922-1925," written by Margaret Fishburne Welbourn (1889-1968). Richard B. Fishburne (1896-1925) was one of Mary Carter's friends. He developed tuberculosis and went to a sanitarium in Oteen, North Carolina in 1923. Fishburne's sister, Margaret, wrote a sketch of the last years of his life based on letters he sent to her while she was living in Japan. She gave copies of the sketch to friends and family on an anniversary of his death.</p>
