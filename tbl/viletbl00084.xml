<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Opera House occupied the second floor of the Leesburg Town Hall/Opera House, located on the northeast corner of King and Loudoun Streets in downtown Leesburg.  At a called meeting on 20 May 1887 the Leesburg Town Council accepted a bid of $14,985.00 to build a town hall from Norris Brothers, who constructed many buildings in Leesburg.  The previous structure on the lot, an ordinary owned by Stephen and Elizabeth Emery, was demolished and construction of the new building was accepted as completed on 3 July 1888.  </p>
<p>The ground floor of the building housed town offices and retail stores.  The fire department was located at the rear of the building, with a tower housing the bell used to summon firefighters.  According to the map prepared by Sanborn Map Company only the first floor of the building was brick, although pictures of the building suggest that it was an all brick structure. The Opera House occupied the second floor of the building with one balcony and seated 450 people on folding wooden chairs.  It was lighted by kerosene oil lamps.  According to most sources, it is doubtful that an opera was ever performed at the Opera House, but it was used for various functions, including a grand ball in September of 1895.  It was mainly used for movies, especially during the silent movie era.  In spite of modifications, when talking movies started, it seemed to be less than adequate for that purpose.  </p>
<p>The Leesburg Town Council sold the building in 1955 for $35,000.  It was demolished the following year and White's Department Store built a new structure on the site, which still stands.</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The collection consists of a reproduction of a handbill advertising a lecture presented by Belle Boyd at the Leesburg Opera House on 4 Dec 1894.  Maria Isabella Boyd, better known as Belle Boyd (9 May 1844- 11 Jun 1900), was born in Martinsburg, VA (now WV).  Because of her activities as a spy for the Confederacy during the Civil War she was arrested and imprisoned three times.  In the late 1880s she began to travel around the country giving dramatic presentations describing her memories of the Civil War and her exploits as a Confederate spy.  Boyd died suddenly of a heart attack while on tour in 1900.
