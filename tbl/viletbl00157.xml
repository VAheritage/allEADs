<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Blue Ridge Library began around 1885 in the Purcellville jewelry shop of Joseph R. Janney (1842-1911), local jeweler and retired Civil War soldier. Janney had collected about four shelves of books that he would loan out to Loudoun County citizens for a few cents apiece. In 1899, the library was taken over by Lillian Davis (n.d.), Virginia B. Hirst (1857-n.d.), Linda Pancoast (ca. 1878-n.d.), and Mary Virginia Smith (n.d.), who organized a collection of 407 books in the general merchandise store of Mr. W. P. Pancoast (1852-1940). On 23 May 1900, however, a fire began in Pancoast's store which spread quickly and destroyed the entire central portion of Purcellville. It is unclear how much, if any, of the collection was saved from the flames.  After the fire, the library moved around to various locations, including a dentist's office. 
</p>
<p>The Blue Ridge Library was run by a board of executive officers, and it hosted fund-raising events such as plays, concerts, and other entertainment. In order to encourage the inhabitants of Purcellville to make use of the library, it also held a weekly story time for children. The library was privately funded during this time, and in 1934 a committee was selected to appeal to the town council for public funds to pay the library's rent.</p>
<p>Records suggest that the Blue Ridge Library closed down at some point between 1934 and 1936 due to the Depression. In 1936, however, the Blue Ridge Library board elected to build a new building for a Purcellville Public Library and Community Center. Funds came from benefit concerts and shows and a grant from the Federal Public Works Administration, and the new library was completed on 13 September 1937. The Purcellville Library still exists today as part of the Loudoun County Public Library System.</p>
