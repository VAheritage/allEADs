      <abstract label="Abstract">This collection consists of 12 family trees or other visual representations of genealogies. Several, such as the "Chichesters of Widworthy" and the Hoge family tree, are examples of artistic representations of pedigree charts as actual trees. They start with an ancestor at the base of the tree and work forward in time, with descendants as leaves on the tree. Other genealogies in the collection are less decorative in their presentation, but also start with one ancestor and work forward in time. The chart for the Dulaney and Weems families, however, is a fan chart; it starts with an individual and traces her ancestry back in time on both sides. Most are reproductions, photocopies, or computer generated prints.

      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>The accessions made in 1995 come from unknown sources. They were extant in the collection at Thomas Balch Library when it belonged to the Loudoun County Public Library System and were transferred as part of the collection when the Town of Leesburg took over ownership of the library. This is an open and artificial collection. Oversized family charts donated to the library will be added to this collection is they do not belong with another set of material.
