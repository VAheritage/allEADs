      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>Westmoreland Davis (1859-1942) was the son of prominent parents who encountered financial difficulties during and after the Civil War.  Despite monetary concerns, Davis was able to attend the Virginia Military Institute as a scholarship student.  He also attended Columbia University and studied law at the University of Virginia.  Afterwards he became part of a successful New York law firm.</p>
      <p>In 1903, Davis bought the Morven Park estate in Loudoun County in an attempt to begin farming.  His political career began in 1917 when he was elected governor on an anti-prohibition platform, and remained in office until 1922.  During his years as governor, he developed an advanced budget plan for Virginia and increased funding for schools and universities.  Westmoreland Davis died on September 7, 1942, at Morven Park.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The Westmoreland Davis Political Collection consists of several broadsides, booklets, and pamphlets from Davis's years as governor.  The items are in overall good condition but should be handled carefully.</p>
      <p>Political circulars are the first items in the collection.  The circulars are small cards that state Westmoreland Davis's platform as respect for fundamental labor rights and remedial legislation for farmers, and urges voters to select him as their next governor.  The next two items are pamphlets declaring Westmoreland Davis as "the Friend of the Children of Virginia."  They discuss Davis's role in appointing the Children's Code Commission and credit him with passing eighteen laws promoting children's welfare.  There are also two pamphlets entitled, "Westmoreland Davis: Of the People, For the People."  They are concerned with improvements he made as governor, including an effective budget plan for Virginia, and improvements in healthcare, education, and law enforcement.  This collection also contains two copies of Davis's Inaugural Address, given in Richmond on February 1, 1918.  In it he discusses the need for education funds and developing state highways.  The next item in the collection is a booklet listing the inaugural ceremonies that took place, as well as pictures of state officials and the governor's mansion.  Also included is an Anti-Saloon League of Virginia broadside, warning voters not to support Davis and other "wet," or anti-prohibition, political figures if they wish to sustain law and order in the state.  Lastly, the collection contains an anti-Davis broadside, insisting that his ambivalence towards labor movements will result in compulsory arbitration and antistrike laws.</p>
      <p>The circulars, pamphlets, and broadsides are the only items in this collection,</p>
