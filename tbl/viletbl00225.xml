The scrapbooks contain clippings from Loudoun County newspapers about births, deaths, marriages, dances, parties, local interest stories, and property transfers. The first scrapbook was probably created in 1938 and 1939, but contains material from much earlier, such as an invitation to her parents' wedding in 1890 and the published wedding announcement. Inserted material from Scrapbook 2 includes a small photograph of Connie and a cutting of her hair. There is a notebook filled with anecdotes and jokes, some of which are suggestive.

</head>
<p>Constance "Connie" Welsh (30 November 1889-12 January 1990) was born to Fayette G. Welsh (1854-1943) and Susan Parthenia Brown Welsh (1865-1948). The family lived on a farm near Hamilton, Virginia, and later moved to Purcellville. Active members of the Society of Friends, the family attended the Goose Creek Meeting. Connie graduated from Lincoln High School; she then attended a business college in Washington, D.C. and worked for the Treasury Department for several years. After working in Washington, she attended Harrisonburg State Teacher's College and the University of Virginia. Connie taught school in Loudoun County for eight years, and then worked as a secretary.
