<abstract label="Abstract">This photographic collection consists of twenty-five black and white photographs of sites within Loudoun County. The majority of the pictures taken are historic homes.  However, a few other landmarks within the county were also captured including Waterford Mill, Thomas Balch Library, Loudoun County Courthouse, Paxton House, Springwood Ball Home Place, and St. James Episcopal Church.  Also included are two farms.  Most of the photographs have been identified although the identities of a few remain unknown. In the list below, photographs identified by Birchfield appear without brackets; those in brackets have been identified by library staff.The photographs appear to have been taken over the course of many years, and all likely date to 1945-1983, the years Birchfield lived near Leesburg. The photographs represent a wide variety of unique architectural styles.

<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Jim (James Fenton) Birchfield (1908-1997) was born in Marion, Virginia and graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1929. In 1935, Birchfield began his career in journalism as editor of <title render="italic">The Washington County</title> (Virginia) <title render="italic">Forum</title>, a newly established weekly in Abingdon. He joined the <title render="italic">Richmond-Times Dispatch</title> editorial staff in 1939, where he remained until 1942. At this juncture, he obtained a position in Washington, D.C. on the editorial staff of the <title render="italic">Washington Star</title>. There he worked on the picture desk and in other editorial roles including serving as state, farm and real estate editor.  As editor for the <title render="italic">Washington Star</title>, he wrote a column entitled "Life in the Country" focusing on the struggles and rewards of rural living. During this time, he resided on his family farm, "Forty Acres," near Leesburg.  In 1974, he retired from the <title render="italic">Washington Star</title>. Birchfield then served briefly as an editor for <title render="italic">The Piedmont Virginian</title>, an environmental weekly based in The Plains, before accepting a position with the <title render="italic">Loudoun-Times Mirror</title>, where he worked from July 1975 until July 1978.  
</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Birchfield cultivated his photographic interests.  In 1965, he became a founding member of the Northern Virginia Photographic Society whose aim was to serve as a camera club for the area.  His photographic images of Loudoun County were used during several calendar years (1974, 1981) for the Peoples National Bank of Leesburg, Virginia.  Photographs of Washington County, Virginia taken by Birchfield were also used for a monograph entitled <title render="italic">Places in Time: Abingdon, Virginia 1778-1880 </title>(Volume 1.) </p>
<p>In 1983 after selling "Forty Acres," he and his wife moved back to Abingdon.  He died at the age of 89 following complications from a stroke.  He is best remembered for his editorial talent, polished writing abilities, and compelling photographic work.</p>
