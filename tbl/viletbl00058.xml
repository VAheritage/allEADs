<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Founded in 1954, Loudoun County High School is the oldest high school in the county, and remained the only high school serving the central part of the county for over 45 years after it opened.  From 2000 to 2005, much of its student population was relocated to Stone Bridge, Heritage, and Freedom High Schools.  In 2005, the school underwent extensive renovations, including the building of a new auxiliary gym and a new library.</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p><title render="italic">Loudoun Destiny</title> is a play detailing the history and origin of Loudoun County.  The play is in overall good condition but should be handled carefully.  </p>
<p>The first scene is a bicentennial parade, including Boy and Girl Scouts, school bands, and a narrator praising how far Loudoun has come.  It then briefly describes the customs of various Native American tribes, and their dislocation to reservations.  The history of Loudoun County is told a series of brief episodes, beginning with early German and Quaker settlements and ending at the bicentennial of the county's founding. The play is particularly concerned with the founding of early Methodist, Quaker, and Catholic Churches in the eighteenth century, the coming of the W &amp;OD Railroad in 1851, and Loudoun's crucial role in the Civil War.  Many of Loudoun's prominent former citizens are mentioned, including Richard Brown (d. 1745) and William Wenner, Sr (d. 1821).  It also details the changes brought by the twentieth century, including electricity, cars, and paved streets.  The repercussions of major national events such as the Great Depression and World Wars I &amp;II in Loudoun are mentioned.  The last scene discusses the impact of the Atomic Age upon the county, the nation, and the world.  The play concludes with the band's rendering of the National Anthem. </p> 
<p>The play is the only item in this collection.           </p>
