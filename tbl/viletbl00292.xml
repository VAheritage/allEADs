<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Lincoln High School was located in Lincoln, Loudoun County, Virginia. The town formerly known as Goose Creek was settled by Quakers from Bucks County, Pennsylvania in 1733. In 1801, a committee of twenty-five was appointed by the Society of Friends, then known as the Goose Creek Meeting House Friends to create their first school building. Later, the Young Friends Association came to the conclusion a new two-story building was needed. In 1908, both the original school and the two story brick school building became insufficient. The community decided a new high school would be built within three-eighths of a mile of the Lincoln crossroads. By 1909, members of the community had raised $14,540 for the new school building on a ten acre site. The Mount Gilead School District also contributed $1,050 towards the school. The first graduating class was comprised of two women. On 1 April 1926 the school burned down and was replaced by a one story building in the same location.</p>
<p>The Lincolnite was a student run newspaper. It lasted up until 1954 when Lincoln High School merged with Loudoun County High School, in Leesburg, Virginia. The old building became the school house for Lincoln Elementary. The original owner of the collection was Katherine Bodeena Graham Updegrove (1924-2016). Bonnie Graham, as she was known, was an active member of the Lincoln High community. She was a forward on the girls' basketball team, she refereed for the school, and participated in the school newspaper. During her senior year of high school, she became both a sports editor and the editor for the paper. After high school, Graham attended Madison College, now known as James Madison University. She then went on to Medical College of Virginia School of Nursing, where she later served on the faculty. Graham married Earl David Updegrove (1919-1989), in Washington DC on 16 January 1949. She worked as an emergency room registered nurse and ended her career as the Associate Director of Nursing at Arlington Hospital before retiring in 1988.
