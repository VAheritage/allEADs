     <head>Historical Information     </head>
          <p>The 210 files in this collection represent architectural surveys prepared for the Black History Committee of Friends of the Thomas Balch Library, Inc. and the County of Loudoun, Department of Planning by History Matters of Washington, D.C.</p>
	  <p>The structures surveyed are in all sections of Loudoun County and represent domestic sites and buildings of numerous types:  dwellings, schools, religious buildings, a few agricultural and commercial buildings, and several cemeteries.  Approximately 90% are located in 30 predominately African American villages, hamlets or neighborhoods of towns.  The remaining properties are located in rural areas and the incorporated towns of Hamilton, Purcellville, and Round Hill.</p>
	  <p>Most of the small communities were founded by freed African Americans in the latter part of the 19th century following the Civil War.  A few were built earlier for white families and were later owned or occupied by African Americans.  Many more were built in the first half of the 20th century.  </p>
	  <p>In the years following the Civil War inhabitants of the hamlets primarily were employed on neighboring farms.  Some ran small stores in the hamlets or were teachers in one-room schools often found in the hamlets and villages.  Inhabitants of the towns worked as domestics or for small businesses in menial jobs.  Preachers for local churches held other jobs as well.  The buildings are unpretentious but generally well built and some have now grown through additions and remodeling as the African Americans became more prosperous and held better paying jobs.  </p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The collection includes 210 file folders coverings sites and structures in all sections of Loudoun County.  Forty-two of the files represent additional information or references to the Lewis/Edwards Architectural Surveys of Loudoun County.  The surveys include a paper form listing address, tax map number, Virginia Department of Historic Resources identification number, a brief description of each site and a notation of its eligibility for the State Historic Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places; photographs of the building(s) or sites, sketch maps of the site, and a copy of the immediate area as shown on the relevant United States Geological Survey (USGS) map.  Also included are one volume of text and two CDs:  one a Power Point presentation of the material and the other a copy of the Survey Report in MS Word format.  There is a printed script to accompany the Power Point presentation inserted in the back of the Report.  Each folder has a copy of the relevant section of the appropriate USGS map.  The relevant USGS maps marked with all of the sites by their state designated numbers are available in the Rust Archive of Thomas Balch Library.  The map of historically African American Communities in Loudoun County reproduced on page three of History Matters' report is available in an enlarged version in the Loudoun County Office of Mapping  in Leesburg, Virginia (Map #2001-015).  The period covered is ca. 1750-ca. 1950.
