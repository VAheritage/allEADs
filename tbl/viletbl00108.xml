<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Griffith E. Thomas (1814-1899), described in his obituary as "one of Loudoun's oldest and most highly respected citizens," was laid to rest in the Mount Zion Cemetery at the time of his death.  Beginning circa 1934, the direct descendents of his nine children with Rebecca Wright Thomas (1821-1911) established the annual Griffith Thomas family reunion that has been held almost exclusively at the church since its inception.  Currently, the family still meets once every year. </p>
<p>The Mount Zion Baptist Church was founded in 1851.  On 4 July 1864, it was the site of a bloody skirmish between Mosby's Rangers and the Second Massachusetts Cavalry, resulting in at least 105 Union casualties.  The church held services until 1980, and is now a Loudoun County historical site.   </p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Griffith Thomas Family of Virginia Collection includes photocopied, handwritten, and typed transcripts of consecutive family reunion meetings between 1934 and 1990.  These items are in overall good condition but should be handled carefully. </p>
<p>The collection minutes begin with the year 1934, and record meeting transactions, marriage and graduation notices, as well as financial reports accounting for monetary awards to graduates, janitorial fees, and the cost of postage.  Also noted are the individuals annually elected to the offices of association president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and historian.  The organization met annually during these decades at the Mount Zion Baptist Church near Aldie, Virginia, with between 80 to 110 members typically present; an exception was the year 1935, in which an outbreak of polio led to its cancellation.  The 1981 transcripts describe the dedication of Carruthers Hall at the University of Virginia in honor of Elmer Irving Carruthers (1874-1951), who served as university bursar and was present at the earliest Griffith Thomas reunions; the 1982 minutes include a biographical obituary of Elizabeth Burns Thomas (1888-1982), which describes her childhood in Loudoun, experiences on a Montana homestead, and subsequent return to Virginia.  In 1985, after expressing concern about the maintenance of the grounds and cemetery, the family formed the Mount Zion Cemetery Company to assist in its preservation.  Along with the trustees of the Mount Zion Church, the Griffith Thomas family funded the placement of a historical marker in 1986.  The reunion minutes and transactions conclude with the year 1990.  </p>
