<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The planned community of Sterling Park originally known as "Broyhill's Addition to Sterling Park" was established in 1962. In 1966, the Sterling Park Woman's Club initiated a project to create a library in Sterling Park. The Sterling Park Woman's Club became a member of the Northern District of the Virginia Federation of Woman's Clubs in 1964. 
</p>
<p>The Sterling Park Woman's Club chose to establish a public library service in Eastern Loudoun County as their Community Improvement Program. The Woman's Club initiated this project in response to the dramatic changes in lower Loudoun County. The county had transformed from a rural area into a suburban area during the 1960s. Loudoun County was only being served by two public libraries (Purcellville and Thomas Balch) in the 519,000 square miles that Loudoun County covered. In 1966, the Sterling park Woman's Club Library Committee began the process of establishing a new public library. The project received strong community support and the Club's Library Committee worked closely with the Purcellville Library and Sterling Park Development Corporation. The Purcellville Library provided guidance, while Sterling Park Development Corporation helped secure a building for the library. The Sterling Park Woman's Club worked on the establishment of the library from May 1966 until the creation of the Sterling Park Library in April 1968.</p>
<p>The Woman's Club successfully helped run the library from 1968 to 1970. The Sterling Park Woman's Club held fundraisers, set up book donations, and organized many events at the Sterling Park Library. The Sterling Park Library joined Loudoun County Public Library system in 1973 with Joan Ciehoski (fl. 1970s) of the Sterling Park Woman's Club becoming one of the initial members of the Library Board. The Sterling Park Library is now referred to as Sterling Library.</p>
