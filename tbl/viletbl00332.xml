</head>
      <p>Morven Park hosted a Smithsonian traveling exhibit program called Museums on Mainstreet in 2022. The exhibit entitled, Crossroads: A Change in Rural America, explores America's agrarian past and how in recent years the population has shifted from about 40% living in rural areas in 1900 to less than 18% in 2010. The exhibit offers small towns a chance to look at their own paths to highlight the changes that affected their fortunes over the past century. The goal is to prompt discussions about what happened when America's rural population became a minority of the country's population and the ripple effects that occurred. The exhibit was housed in Morven Park's Winmill Carriage Museum and visitors were allowed to roam through the exhibit at no charge. The Smithsonian provided postcards with prompts on them to allow the visitor to reflect on their own community and the challenges it faces presently. The exhibit ran from 22 April 2022, to 13 June 2022. </p>
