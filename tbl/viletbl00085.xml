<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Lincoln High School was located in the unincorporated village of Lincoln in Loudoun County, VA.  Goose Creek, as the community was first named, was settled by Quakers during the 1750s.   The Friends were concerned about education, and established a committee of 75 to seek better education for all white children.  Their efforts resulted in the construction of a one-room school house in 1815 at a cost of $400.00.</p>
<p>In 1880 the Young Friends Association began discussions about a need for better higher education in conjunction with a graded school.  Largely due to their efforts a new two story school building was built nearby with graded classes on the first floor and high school on the second.  By 1909 this building was no longer adequate, and the Lincoln community raised $14,540.00 for a new building on a ten acre site.  The Mt. Gilead School District added another $1,050.00.  The community provided much funding for furnishings and supplies, and supplemented teachers' salaries.  Two students graduated in the first graduating class in 1910.  Because of the reputation of the school, some students from other parts of the county boarded in homes in the community so that they could attend Lincoln High School. </p>
<p>On 1 April 1926 the building burned to the ground, but after much discussion and controversy about where a new school should be built, a new one-story building was built on the same site as the previous building.   It continued to serve as a high school until 1953, when funds were approved to build a consolidated high school, Loudoun County High School, in Leesburg in 1954.  Lincoln's elementary school students moved into the old Lincoln High School building in 1954. </p>
