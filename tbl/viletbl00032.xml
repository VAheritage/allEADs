<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Hugh Campbell (d. 20 Nov 1731) was the eldest son of James Campbell, 2nd Earl of Loudoun (d. 1684), and Lady Margaret Montgomery (n.d.).  He succeeded his father as 3rd Earl of Loudoun upon James' death in 1684 and took his seat in Scotland's parliament on 8 Sep 1696.  Upon the recommendation of the Earl of Argyll, Campbell was appointed Extraordinary Lord of Session by King William in 1699.  Under Queen Anne Campbell held the offices of Commissioner of the Treasury, joint Secretary of State for Scotland, and Keeper of the Great Seal.  Following the ascension of King George I in 1714 he was sworn a privy councilor and in 1715 was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ayrshire.  Between 1722 and 1731 he was elected Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland six times.</p>
<p>Campbell served under John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, at the Battle of Sheriffmuir in 1715 during the second major Jacobite rebellion.  The Earl of Mar, a former supporter of Queen Anne, began to amass forces in September of 1715 to join the English Jacobites in their effort to return a Stuart to the throne.  Argyll was placed in command of a combination of English and Scottish troops that supported the Hanoverian government.   The two armies met at Sheriffmuir on 13 November and engaged in a bloody battle.  Argyll's men were outnumbered by the Jacobites, but both sides took heavy casualties and there was no decisive victory.  The battle sapped the momentum of the uprising and it soon petered out.  After the rebellion had been quelled, Campbell had some success interceding with the government on behalf of Jacobite prisoners.</p>
<p> Hugh Campbell married Lady Margaret Dalrymple (4 Sep 1677-3 Apr 1777) on 6 Apr 1700.  They had three children, John (1705-1782), Elizabeth (n.d.), and Margaret (n.d.).  Hugh Campbell died in Loudoun Castle, Ayrshire.  John, who took the title in 1731 following his father's death, is the namesake of Loudoun County, VA.</p>

<head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>This collection contains one bookplate belonging to Hugh Campbell, 3rd Earl of Loudoun, bearing the motto, "I Byde My Time." The bookplate's printed coat of arms features a two-headed dragon resting on a helm nestled into a five-pronged crown. A shield is below the crown, divided into eight pie-slices that alternate between ermine fur and dark sections. Its oval shape is unusual.  The shield is stabilized on either side by a soldier with an upright spear and a woman holding a roll of paper. The shield most likely was colored Argent and Sable, or black and white.
