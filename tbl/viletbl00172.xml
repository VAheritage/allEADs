<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Leesburg Hospital, Inc. (now Inova Loudoun Hospital)*, was originally located on Market Street in Leesburg, VA.  It was established in 1912 by Dr. William Clayton Orr (1878-1926), President, and Dr. John A. Gibson (1876-1947), Vice President.  The Ladies Board (TLB) was organized the same year to provide volunteer supervision of housekeeping and to provide fund raising.   The board, originally composed of forty women representing various areas of Loudoun County and called the Ladies Board of Managers, was headed by Mrs. William Cochran Eustis (Edith Livingston Morton) (1874-1964) who served as president until 1919. It is unclear when the name of the Ladies Board of Managers was changed to The Ladies Board, but it seems to have been in 1912 or 1913.  In time the volunteers on TLB not only oversaw housekeeping, they also supplied china, glassware, and silver for the dining room, kitchen equipment, and supplies for beds, rooms, and wards.  From 1926 until 1932 a primary concern of TLB was furnishing and maintaining a home for nurses.
</p>
<p>In order to raise money for these projects, TLB held the first of its rummage sales in 1938 at St. James Episcopal Church in Leesburg, VA; total profit that year was $150.00.  This annual sale, which has become the largest fund-raising event of TLB, outgrew St. James Episcopal Church, moved to the 4-H Fairgrounds, and later to Morven Park Equestrian Center in Leesburg.  In 2010, proceeds from the rummage sale totaled more than $150,000.00.</p>
<p>A Penny Fund, now called Polly Clemens Nursery Fund for its long-time chair, was started to fund needs of The Birthing Inn at the hospital's Lansdowne location.  The facility is called The Ladies Board of Loudoun Inova Hospital Birthing Inn in recognition of TLB. Other fund-raising ventures include the Ladies Board Gift Shop established in 1974, first located in the hospital at Cornwall Street in Leesburg and now at Inova Loudoun Hospital's Lansdowne location.  In 1990 TLB opened a thrift shop, Twice Is Nice, currently located at 305 East Market Street in Leesburg.  To help raise money for nursing scholarships given by TLB, a Lights of Love program was established in 1983.  Lights of Love offers a way to honor or remember people who have made a difference in one's life by making a donation to the program; all donations go toward nursing scholarships.</p>
<p>Funds from all of these activities are donated to various departments of Inova Loudoun Hospital, and have funded many projects contributing to patient care and treatment through the years.</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection includes scrapbooks, annual reports, news articles, and photographs tracing the activities of The Ladies Board (TLB) from its founding in 1912 until 2009.  Most of the records are from 1964 to 2009.  It is an open collection since the board is still active in supporting Inova Loudoun Hospital.  Early records are very sketchy and most of the information is found in brief histories of TLB written by early, unidentified members of the board.  Annual reports for eight years were copied from the personal files of Kay B. Stowers of Leesburg, VA; these have been noted in the container list.  Loose materials were removed from scrapbooks or manila envelopes and placed in file folders. Envelopes of photographs were removed to VC 0040.  Manuscript relocation sheets have been inserted in scrapbooks from which materials and photographs were removed.  Materials from 1996, 1997, and 2001 were not kept in scrapbooks but in brown accordion files from which they were removed to the files indicated.  Materials for 1995 and 1998-2002 were kept in manila envelopes from which they were removed to the files indicated.  In several instances miscellaneous materials were in manila envelopes inserted in scrapbooks.  These materials were removed to files and relocation sheets have been placed in the scrapbook and the original location has been noted in the container list.
