<head>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH
</head>
<p>Alexander McIntyre (fl. 1820-1849) was the son of Patrick McIntyre (1788- 1821) and Mary M. McIntyre (1780-1849). He had seven siblings, Christopher (1806-1843), Robert (1811-1864), Catherine (1814-1880), Lucy (1807-1887), Laura (1813-1885), Ellen (1810-1857), and John (fl. 1821 - 1849). Upon the death of Patrick in 1821, his estate, including land in Loudoun County, was divided up among his family. One-third was willed to his wife and the other two-thirds were divided among his eight children.  With the exception of Christopher McIntyre, all of the children named in the will were under the age of 21, so Lewis Penn Witherspoon Balch (1787-1833) was appointed as a guardian. Two chancery court cases were brought in 1824 and regarding portions of the land that were sold by Christopher McIntyre. The eighth share held by Alexander McIntyre was located near Waterford and was adjacent to the parcels of land owned by Abraham Skillman (fl. 1780-1844) and William Wilkinson (fl. 1800-1844). On 1 June 1840, Alexander sold 200 acres of the estate to his brother-in-law William H. Moore (1809-1883).  Along with the eighth share of property inherited by his wife, Laura F. McIntyre Moore (1813-1885), more purchased additional property in this area from the estate of Patrick McIntyre in October 1838. The Moores also owned additional farm land in Loudoun County as well as in Jefferson County.  The couple relocated to Jefferson County, West Virginia before 1860 living in Harpers Ferry and later in Shepherdstown.
