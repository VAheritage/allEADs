<head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
<p>When the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia was ratified in 1776, only white male landowners over the age of 21 could vote. In 1829, voting privileges were extended to white men over 21 who were the heads of their households but did not own land; finally in 1850, all white males over the age of 21 were allowed to vote. After the Civil War, southern states were required to extend voting privileges to African-Americans. In 1868, Virginia ratified a new constitution that enabled black men to vote and hold office. According to an 1870 act passed by the Virginia Assembly, ledgers containing names and information of all eligible voting men were to be kept separate for blacks and whites.
</p><p>Bessie Love Steele (2 August 1870-25 December 1950) was the daughter of Stuart R. (26 July 1833-12 April 1902) and Martha Jane Steele (8 June 1849-15 November 1909). On 4 December 1889, she married Jacob Stuart Smith (18 February 1862-3 January 1930), with whom she had three children: Annie Gertrude (5 October 1890-10 September 1970), Stuart Jacob (9 August 1895-7 August 1971), and Henry Ogden (1900-12 September 1964). Annie worked for the Virginia Electric and Power Company and lived in Purcellville for her entire life. Stuart married J. Myrtle Cornwell (19 May 1889-12 October 1975) on 22 October 1927, worked for the Loudoun Light and Power Company, and was a veteran of World War I. Henry moved to Washington D.C., married, and had three children. Bessie and Jacob lived in Purcellville for over sixty years.</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>
The collection contains a ledger from the Purcellville Precinct recording white men eligible to vote from 1888 to 1901. The list provides voter's name, age, occupation, place of residence, length of residence in the county and in the state, and whether the voter was transferred to or from another district.
</p><p>Interfiled in the ledger were personal items, which have been removed and placed in folders. There is an undated Easter card addressed to Bessie Steele, a calling card to "Mother Steele," a letter addressed to Annie Smith from 1962, and a school diploma awarded to Stuart Smith in 1906. In a miscellaneous folder, there is a July 1909 newspaper clipping from The Winchester Evening Star, blotting paper, and black lace.</p>
