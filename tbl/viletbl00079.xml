<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Brunswick, Maryland traces its beginnings to 1834, when both the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad and the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal began building there. Eventually, the railroad began to supplant the canal system and by 1883, B&amp;O built extensive yards and maintenance shops to service the coal powered trains.  As a result of the investment by B&amp;O, Brunswick exploded in growth. Between 1890 and 1896, the town's population increased from 300 to 3000 and the town continued to grow rapidly during the first two decades of the 20th century. Accordingly, the educational system reflected this population change. Established in 1900, Brunswick High School first opened in one room of an existing building with 31 students. The growth of the town led to different buildings for the high school in 1902 and 1912. By 1927, it was evident that a another new addition would be needed; however, a destructive fire in February, 1928 forced the school to find temporary accommodations for the students until a new building could be erected on the existing site. The new building in 1928 was a two story brick structure with a total of 16 classrooms, an office, a teacher's lounge, two cloak rooms, locker rooms, a cafeteria, an auditorium, and a gymnasium as well an area for home economics for the girls and shop for the boys.  The graduating class of Brunswick High students in the photograph poses in front of what was then a relatively new structure.
