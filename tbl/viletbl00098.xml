      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>In 1871, the Virginia General Assembly passed a bill establishing public schools; prior to 1871, localities had only private schools.  Waterford's first private school, the Friends' Meeting School on Loyalty Road, was established in 1805-1806 with a donation by local merchant John Williams.</p>
      <p>In 1877, Edwin Atlee sold one and one half acres at Fairfax and High Streets to school trustees of Jefferson District for $350 for construction of a public school.  Waterford Academy, built in 1880, was destroyed in February 1909 by a fire started when a custodian cleaning stoves left a bucket of hot coal ashes on the wooden floor.  Classes were held in the Baptist church basement until a new school was completed.</p>
      <p>The new school, which opened for the 1910-1911 session, was built at a cost of $6000 with funds secured from private donations, insurance, and state literacy fund.  The main building was a two-story, three-bay framed structure; an auditorium was added in 1928.  School facilities also included horse stables, the stalls of which were leased by parents whose children rode to school.  This school served as a public elementary school for first through seventh grades until 1965, when the current facility on Loyalty Road opened.  </p>
      <p>In 1966, the Waterford Foundation purchased the old Waterford School property from the Loudoun County School Board. Since then, the facility has served as exhibit space, reception hall for weddings, and a space for New Year's celebrations and craft classes. On 25 January 2007, a fire destroyed the auditorium, but left the original 1910 structure unharmed.</p>
