<head>HISTORICAL SKETCH
</head>
<p>In 1976, the United States celebrated the Bicentennial of the American Revolution and independence. Businesses, organizations, and private individuals all contributed to multi-year commemorations. Many departments of the Federal Government developed programming and published materials during the Bicentennial. These activities were directed by the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission, established in 1966 by President Lyndon Johnson and later by the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration, formed by President Richard Nixon in 1973. The majority of the federal festivities occurred leading up to and on the official celebration in Washington D.C. on 4 July 1976, however commemorative events and materials continued to be produced to correspond with important anniversaries of the events of the Revolutionary war until public interest waned. </p>
<p>Both the United States Postal Service [USPS] and the National Park Service [NPS] produced special materials throughout the celebrations.  The USPS produced several series of commemorative stamps, beginning with issue of the Spirit of '76 series based on a painting by Archibald M. Willard of a fife and drum corps, and expanding to highlight numerous events and themes of the era. Commemorative stamps continued to be issued after July 1976.  For example, the Lafayette stamp, part of the American Revolution Bicentennial series, was issued 13 June 1977. Posters were created to promote each stamp issue.  NPS activities were coordinated from the Washington Area Service Office Bicentennial Office.  While all parks held a Bicentennial event of some type, the parks related to the Revolutionary War, Independence, and other selected areas were designated as Official Bicentennial Sites and received special promotion.  Artists were commissioned to create posters for sale at NPS sites and to promote events.  Works created included both illustrative images of historic events or park features and abstract art. </p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection consists of six large rolled posters created between 1974 and 1976 as part of the United States Federal Government's celebration of the American Revolution and Independence. Three posters were created and used by United States Postal Service [USPS] to promote the release of American Commemorative stamp series.  These include the Spirit of '76, the Lover of Liberty and the Skilled Hands for Independence stamp series.   Three posters were issued for sale by the National Park Service [NPS].  These include posters illustrative of a historical event, such as the 1758 Fort Necessity poster, a poster featuring the Liberty Bell to promote Independence National Part, and an abstract artwork by artist Carol Summers.</p>
<p>Posters are rolled.  USPS posters show wear from display, including tears, pin holes, and tape. </p>
