<abstract label="Abstract">This collection is made up of the administrative papers of the Home Interest Club. Records include correspondence, financial records, meeting agendas and minutes, as well as some of the notes for presentations made by members at the monthly meetings. Presentations made by Rachel Hoge Branch (1875-1944), one of the founding members, have been photocopied and collected in a bound volume by her son. The volume, included here, is titled Papers from Overlea. There are handwritten recipes contributed by the membership, some of them dating to the founding of the club. The recipes have been arranged thematically in preparation for the production of a cookbook in 2003, a copy of which is also included in the collection. Also of note in the collection are yearbooks, which contain the names of the officers for the year, a list of meetings, and brief descriptions of the meeting presentations. It was common for the yearbooks to be bound in scraps of wallpaper. The collection includes a small set of photographs from three summer picnics, and a walnut button box that was used in the election of new members to the club.

<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Home Interest Club was founded in the fall of 1903 by a group of women near Lincoln, VA and continues to operate. Most of the founding women were members of the Society of Friends, though involvement with the Friends was not a prerequisite for membership in the club. The constitution and bylaws of the club state that it is to "Benefit the home by making housekeeping easier in the exchanging of recipes and the discussion of all topics tending to elevate and improve the home." One of the original requirements of membership was that every woman share a proven recipe at each meeting. Some of the recipes were eventually published in a cookbook written to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the founding of the club, a copy of which is included in the club's records.
</p>
<p>
Some of the early members of the club included:

</list></p>
<p>The club holds monthly meetings that throughout its history have consisted of a roll call, discussion of club business, a program, and refreshments. The program usually consists one or more presentations by members. Presentations may include readings from published material or original writings, but are usually informational in nature. Topics have included temperance, suffrage for women, civil rights for African Americans, foreign affairs, local history, and current events. During World War II there was a program on using sugar substitutes and members were asked to contribute sugar-shortage recipes. The membership also shares ideas about education, child rearing, and household maintenance. </p>
<p>Initially, membership was capped at twenty, though in 1936 the club amended its constitution to allow thirty. When a membership becomes available in the club, an active member nominates a woman. Her name is brought before the club at a meeting, and each member votes to approve or deny the nominated woman. Balloting was done originally using a button box and white and black buttons. A white button placed in the box was a vote to approve the nomination, while a black button denied membership. The club's constitution stipulates that approval be unanimous. The button box was eventually retired in favor of a secret ballot; currently the club uses a vocal vote. New officers are elected each fall and take their posts in January.</p>
<p>The club works with other organizations in the community to raise money for and awareness of issues affecting women and children. It has collaborated with the Paxton Home for Children, Hamilton Book Club, Purcellville Woman's Club, and Leesburg Garden Club on various projects in the community. The Home Interest Club remains active and continues to donate resources and energy to projects to improve the Loudoun County community. </p>
