<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>In 1976, the United States celebrated the Bicentennial of the American Revolution and Independence. Businesses, organizations, and private individuals all contributed to multi-year commemorations. Many departments of the Federal Government developed programming and published materials during the Bicentennial. These activities were directed by the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission, established in 1966 by President Lyndon Johnson and later by the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration, formed by President Richard Nixon in 1973. The majority of the federal festivities occurred leading up to and on the official celebration in Washington DC on 4 July 1976, however commemorative events and materials continued to be produced to correspond with important anniversaries of the events of the Revolutionary War until public interest waned.</p>
<p>The National Park Service [NPS] produced special materials throughout the celebrations.  NPS activities were coordinated from the Washington Area Service Office Bicentennial Office.  While all parks held a Bicentennial event of some type, the parks related to the Revolutionary War, Independence, and other selected areas were designated as Official Bicentennial Sites and received special promotion.  Artists were commissioned to create posters for sale at NPS sites and to promote events.  Works created included both illustrative images of historic events or park features, information related to the Continental Army, and abstract art. </p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection consists of two large rolled printers' proofs of The Continental Soldier poster created in 1976 as part of the United States Federal Government's celebration of the American Revolutionary War and Independence. Continental Soldier posters were published in cooperation with the Sunday Times of London and issued for sale by the Division of Publications of the National Park Service [NPS].  The posters give detailed information about the American army during the American Revolutionary War featuring interpretive text prepared by Harold L. Peterson (1922-1978), NPS Chief Curator from 1963-1978 and author of nineteen military history books including The Book of the Continental Soldier: Being a Complete Account of the Uniforms, Weapons, and Equipment with Which he Lived and Fought. Artist Don Troiani (1949 - ) contributed military illustrations for the poster. </p>
<p>Both posters are printer's proofs with color control bars and alignment guides printed on each edge. One poster is printed on both sides and features a proof of an NPS poster issued to commemorate the Fort Necessity National Battlefield on the reverse. Posters measure 30" x 50", are rolled, and show foxing. </p>
