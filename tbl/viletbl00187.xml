      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>Joseph Burson (1736-1825) purchased one hundred and fifty acres of land on 4 November 1771 from George Burson (1698-1796) for five shillings. George Burson originally purchased the land from Thomas John (d. 1769). Thomas John and George Burson were listed on the Rental Rolls, a list of those who leased land from local landowners in Loudoun County. Joseph Burson, his children, and his grandchildren were farmers in Loudoun County. In 1815, he wrote a will in which he named his sons, John Burson (1793-1879) and Cyrus Burson (1816-1892) as heirs. When Joseph Burson died in 1825, his sons inherited the land. 
</p>
      <p>In 1840, John and Cyrus Burson were still living on the land in the area enumerated by Jonah Hood, known as Cameron Parish. Cameron Parish was an area in the Second District of Loudoun County, east of Goose Creek. Cyrus Burson was listed as living in Union, Ohio in 1860 and then listed as living in Belmont, Iowa in 1880. John Burson was listed as living in the Southern District of Loudoun County from 1860 until his death in 1879. As of 1870, his real estate was valued at $15,160 and his personal estate was valued at $928. </p>
      <p>John Burson's children, Adelaide Burson (1837-1910) and Albert Burson (1841-1904) lived in the area at least until 1900.  The brother and sister lived in the Mercer area (west of Cameron Parish) from 1880-1900, and maybe longer. Adelaide Burson was reported as living in Mt. Gilead as a boarder in 1910. </p>
      <p>The Burson family land is located near the area now known as South Riding in Dulles, Loudoun County, Virginia. This is near the towns of Centreville, Conklin, and Chantilly. </p>
