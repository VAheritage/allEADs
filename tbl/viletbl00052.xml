<p>The Girl Scouts Gold Award was first introduced in 1980, and is the highest honor for a Girl Scout. Awarded to girls between the ages of 14 and 18, it is meant to encourage organizational, leadership, and networking skills and should be of further use and maintenance to the community. The project is meant to fill a need in a local or global community, create change, and be ongoing. Last year approximately 5.4% of all eligible Girl Scouts were given the award.</p>
<p>Katherine Peterson of Girl Scout Council of the Nation's Capital Troop 2372 compiled this scrapbook as her service project for eligibility. She received the Gold Award along with 183 other Girl Scouts at an annual ceremony on May 13, 2006, in Washington, D.C. She then donated her project to the Thomas Balch Library so that it could be used for research.</p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p><title render="italic">Ashburn: Then and Now</title> is a scrapbook that recounts the history of Ashburn throughout the twentieth century. It contains numerous pictures, interviews, newspaper articles, and compact discs, and examines the establishment and architectural styles of many local landmarks.</p>
<p>The scrapbook begins with a newspaper article concerning the history of the Greater Zion Baptist Church. The following page contains brief descriptions of Ashburn landmarks such as Ashburn Presbyterian Church, Hane's Bottom, W &amp; OD Trail, Ferguson's Livery and the Arundell Store, Belmont Plantation, Broad Run Toll Bridge and House, Weller Tile Buildings, Greater Zion Baptist Church and School, the Ashburn Volunteer Fire Department, Ashburn School, Janelia, Ashburn House, and Ashburn Farm. This is followed by six interviews with citizens of Old Ashburn, including Steuart Weller, Betty LeFevre Cooke, Murrel Patlow, Melvin Lee Patlow, Ruth Boone Judd, Jack Lawlor, and Charlotte Lawlor. Each person recounts the characteristics of Old Ashburn, discussing schools such as Leesburg High School and Ashburn High School, as well as local buildings such as Patlow's Store, Cavalry Baptist Church, Heritage Baptist Church, and Ashburn Presbyterian Church. The changes brought by drastic population increase, large-scale development, and the vicinity of the Dulles Airport are also discussed. The next several pages include pictures and articles concerning many of the places mentioned, including Ashburn Junction, Old Ashburn streets, Ashburn's Mill, Arundell's Store, Ashburn Hotel, Belmont, pictures of elementary and high school graduates from 1917 to 1962, Solomon House, pictures of various Ashburn baseball teams, and the development that continues into modern times. The scrapbook is concluded with two articles concerning Leesburg at the turn of the century and the donation of Claude Moore's farm to the National Wildlife Federation.</p>
<p>The scrapbook is the only item in this collection.</p>
