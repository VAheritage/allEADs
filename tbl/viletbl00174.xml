<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p><title render="italic">Our Virginia: Past and Present</title> written by Joy Masoff (1951-) and published by Five Ponds Press was adopted as a fourth grade social studies textbook for students in Virginia's public schools in 2010.  Soon after its distribution to schools, Carol Sheriff, professor of history at the College of William &amp; Mary, detected errors in her daughter's textbook.  These errors referred to black soldiers fighting for the Confederacy during the Civil War.  A report by three independent reviewers-Dr. Ronald Heinemann, Retired, Hampden-Sydney College; Dr. Lauranett Lee, Curator of African American History, Virginia Historical Society; and Dr. Brent Tarter (1948-), retired, Library of Virginia-done for the Virginia Department of Education in December 2010 cites numerous omissions as well as additional factual and grammatical errors in the book.  The publishing company offered labels making the corrections which could be affixed over the misinformation. The Virginia Board of Education announced on 24 March 2011 that it withdrew approval of that text and a fifth grade history text, entitled Our America to 1865, also published by Five Ponds Press.  On 21 October 2011 Wyade Byard, spokesman for Loudoun County Public Schools, announced that these books had been withdrawn from Loudoun County's classrooms.
</p>
<p>At the same time The Virginia Board of Education announced that it had adopted a revised text book review and adoption process which requires that future texts be reviewed by qualified experts before being submitted to the Department of Education for possible adoption in Virginia's classrooms.</p>
