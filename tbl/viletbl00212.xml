<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Ebenezer Church, also referred to as Ebenezer Meeting House, located in Bloomfield, Loudoun County, Virginia was constituted in April 1804 by nine members of the Goose Creek Baptist Church and eight members of the Ketoctin Baptist Church who were dismissed from their congregations for the purpose of creating a new congregation. In 1834, doctrinal split and accusations and investigations of disorderly conduct resulted in the division of the congregation into the Old School and New School doctrines. In January 1834, Samuel Butcher, Jr. (fl. 1830s) deeded two acres of land to trustees of Ebenezer Church and gave instructions to allow any party of Baptist to use the Ebenezer Meeting House.
</p>
<p>Both the Old School and New School Baptist congregations used the meeting house from 1834-1855. In 1855, the New School congregation built their own church after a fire in the Old Church. The New School built the New Church on land deeded from William Galleher (fl. 1850s) and his wife, Mary Galleher (fl. 1850s). In 1887, Ebenezer Cemetery Company was incorporated, and New Church's cemetery was chartered in 1888, however there is evidence of burials prior to the official chartering of the cemetery. Services in the Old Church discontinued in the early 1900s and The Cemetery Company acquired the title to the Old Church in 1934. The Cemetery Company's charter was revoked for non-payment of taxes in 1941 and it is believed that the New Church stopped holding services several years before this.</p>
<p>In December 1959, The Ebenezer Cemetery Company was officially reorganized and incorporated. Since the incorporation of the Ebenezer Cemetery Company the church has cleaned up the cemeteries, purchased land, and restored the churches. Both the Old and New Church were restored in the 1970s and 1980s. Ebenezer Cemetery Company won the Loudoun Preservation Society Award of Merit in 1992 and the churches were placed on the Virginia Register of Historical Places and National Register of Historical Places in1994.</p>
