<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Norris and Sons carpentry business was established during the 1840s by John Grey Norris (1812-1907), who had married the daughter of Thomas Birkby (1778-1851).  In 1850 he renamed the company Norris and Sons, and moved its location nearer to the railroad.  He was assisted in the business by sons Samuel (1848-1933) and Joseph Lafayette Norris (1834-1908), both of whom worked in the office and oversaw the company after their father's death.  Another son, Lemuel Norris (1848-1930), was an architect in Washington and often worked for Norris and Sons.  </p>
<p>During the latter half of the nineteenth century, many of the buildings in downtown Leesburg were constructed by Norris and Sons.  In 1905 the company's name was changed to Norris and Sons.  About twenty-five years later, J.T. Hirst purchased the business. Recently, J.T. Hirst was bought by T.W. Perry and the company continues to operate under that name.   </p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Norris and Son Account Book is a ledger recording the customers, prices, and services rendered by the company.  Pages are legibly paginated.  The front and back covers have names and figures written upon them.  Towards the end of the book, several pages are ripped out.  Dried flower petals are wedged between some pages.  The ledger is in overall good condition but should be handled carefully.  </p>
<p>The account book begins with an alphabetical listing of the company's customers and the money they owe.  After the alphabetical listing, the ledger contains detailed information of each customer's account.  Names are recorded at the top of the page, as well as the work the company has done and the amount it will cost.  Jobs include putting in shelves, floor repair, shingling roofs, door hinging and replacement, and porch repair.  Total costs range from $200 to $600.  Names of recurrent customers include Charles A. Johnston (1806-1877), Bank of the Valley, Corporation Leesburg, and the 4th South Carolina Infantry Regiment.  The ledger concludes with the year 1866.</p>
<p>The Norris and Son Account Book is the only item in this collection.  </p>
