<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Hamilton, Virginia is a small town located roughly seven miles from Leesburg, Virginia.  Hamilton was founded around 1750 and initially named Harmony. The town's name was changed to Hamilton's Store in 1826 and shortened to Hamilton in December 1835. On 18 February 1875, the General Assembly approved an act incorporating the Town of Hamilton, which had the second largest population in Loudoun County next to Leesburg. The first mayor was John H. Hughes (18 June 1813-14 September 1893) and the first councilmen included J.B. Franklin (1840-18 May 1892), recorder, Jefferson Milbourn (6 June 1815-30 May 1882), sergeant, Dr. J.D. Harman  (1 January 1840-1 March 1878), John H. Wiley (6 January1823-28 March 1884), T.H. Vandeventer (1 May 1844-11 August 1926), S.B. Mercier (15 May 1848-26 December 1929), Richard McFarland (n.d.) and Thomas Schooley (25 November 1824-02 January 1893).  Town ordinances were adopted 12 March 1875 that included provisions for tax collection, upkeep of streets, and managing livestock kept by townspeople.
</p>
<p>During the late 19th and early 20th centuries Hamilton became popular as a tourist destination for people in Washington, D.C., who came by train in the summer.  A fire in 1926 destroyed businesses and houses in town, reducing accommodations and attractions for visitors.  Even after rebuilding, tourism in Hamilton declined, hastened by the advent of automobiles which allowed people to choose other destinations.  Present day Hamilton is mostly residential.
