     <head>Historical Information</head>
     <p>The Commonwealth of Virginia chartered the Alexandria, Loudoun &amp; Hampshire Railroad (hereinafter AL&amp;HR) on 15 March 1853 and Lewis McKenzie (1810-1895) was its first president. AL&amp;HR was established to provide transportation to the coalfields in upper Potomac via Winchester, VA.  Construction commenced in February of1855.  Due to financial difficulties, grading from Alexandria to Leesburg took three and a half years and 37.5 miles were completed by summer of 1858. It took another three years before rail service reached Leesburg. Because of continuing financial problems and disruption from the Civil War, tracks did not reach Hamilton until March 1870.  AL&amp;HR received their first mail contract from the U. S. Post Office Department with delivery of mail from Alexandria to Leesburg in March of 1861.  The contract continued for 90 years with a break during the Civil War.  </p>
     <p>Robert E. Lee requisitioned two locomotives from the AL&amp;HR in May of 1861. Federal troops took possession of the AL&amp;HR in 1861, holding it until 1865. The railroad was returned to the Virginia Board of Public Works on 8 Aug 1865. The four years and three months that the Federal Army had possession of AL&amp;HR was the longest military control of any southern railroad during the Civil War. </p>
     <p>As the major capital stock holder (three-fifths) the Commonwealth of Virginia had to liquidate its holdings in the AL&amp;HR because of financial problems following the war.  Lewis McKenzie and a group of investors were able to purchase the Commonwealth's shares in the railroad, and rail service resumed with one round trip a day from Alexandria to Leesburg in 1867. Ongoing financial problems slowed westward construction.  In March 1870, AL&amp;HR reached Hamilton and passenger service increased to two round trips daily from Alexandria to Hamilton.</p>
     <p>Following repossession of the railway, McKenzie and his group sought to expand their sphere of influence from the coalfields of the upper Potomac to the Ohio River through West Virginia.  In 1870 they applied for and received a new charter from West Virginia for the AL&amp;HR, renaming it the Washington &amp; Ohio Railroad.</p>
