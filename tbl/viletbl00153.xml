<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The Sons of the American Revolution was founded on 30 April 1889 in recognition of the hundredth anniversary of George Washington's inauguration.  The organization was a fraternal and civic society whose members were lineal descendents of soldiers and statesmen who "wintered at Valley Forge, signed the Declaration of Independence, fought in the battles of the American Revolution, served in the Continental Congress, or otherwise supported the cause of American Independence."  The National Society was charted by an Act of Congress on 9 June 1906.
</p>
<p>John Champe (ca. 1752-1798) enlisted as a volunteer in the Continental Army in 1776, was made a corporal in 1777, and had been promoted to sergeant by 1779.  In 1780, Benedict Arnold's scheme to surrender the West Point fort to the British was discovered when John Andre (1751-1780), messenger to Sir Henry Clinton (1732-1795), was detained and executed.  Washington's advisors then developed a plan to capture Arnold; at the suggestion of Major Richard Henry Lee (1756-1818), Champe was to be sent to the opposing camp to join Arnold's command under the guise of a deserter from the Continental Army.  Once there, he was to apprehend Arnold on behalf of the American forces.  This plan was foiled when Arnold's troops embarked for Virginia the day Champe arrived at camp, leaving him with no choice but to fight against the American army.  He "deserted" again at Petersburg to rejoin Lee's command.  Though Champe had been promised "ample rewards" and land grants, he never received compensation for his actions, arguably because he refused to accept Washington's proffered reward.  He died in Marion County in present-day West Virginia, and his heirs did not receive a land grant or pension until 1835. </p>
