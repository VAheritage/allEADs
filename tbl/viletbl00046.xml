<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Myers Sawmill was originally built by the Frick Company of Williamsburg, Pennsylvania.  In 1925 Gordon G. Moreland (1901-1988) purchased the mill for John Myers (1902-1988).  For the next 37 years, Moreland managed the sawmill, cutting and selling wood to customers throughout Loudoun and Clarke Counties.  The timber was most often purchased by railroad suppliers.  He left the sawmill in 1962 because of health concerns but continued to work for the Myers Lumber Company until his retirement in 1984.  </p>
<p>The sawmill was an operation of the Myers Lumber Company in Purcellville, Virginia. In 1941 Myers bought the Case Lumber Company and converted it into Myers Lumber Company.  His brother, Leland F. Myers, joined the business in 1946.  The company was sold soon after Leland Myers's death in 1983.  Both the sawmill and the lumber company have since ceased operation.    </p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Myers Sawmill Pay Books account for the years 1941, 1942, 1949, 1958, 1959, and 1961.  Each of the six books contains names of employees at the sawmill, number of hours each employee worked daily and weekly, collective wages, tax deductions, and other earnings.  These books contain inserts with paperclips and some pages are stapled together.  Phone numbers and math figures are penciled in on most pages</p>
<p>Record entries begin with the week of September 15 to 20, 1941 and conclude with the week of December 25 to 30, 1961.  Names of recurring customers include George Pomeroy, Harley Smith, Charles Harris, W.J. Reid, George Reid, Howard Reid, William Reid, James Harris, and G. Moreland.  Hours range from 35 to 40 hours a week.  Wages per hour are about a dollar, and weekly wages range from eight to forty-four dollars, depending on how many hours employees  worked.  Furthermore, absent or replaced employees are also recorded.  Several entries are listed in the last book in which there are no employees operating the sawmill.  Several of the books contain wage tables per hour on the front covers.</p>
<p>The sawmill pay books are the only items in this collection.  </p>
