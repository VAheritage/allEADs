<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Leesburg Hospital was created as a result of the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. The hospital was also known as General Hospital and 7th Brigade Hospital, simply because the majority of its patients were Confederate soldiers in Brigadier General Nathan "Shanks" Evans' (February 1824-November 1868) 7th Brigade.
</p>
<p>The hospital was housed in the Leesburg Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Its congregation had once been part of the Old Stone Church in Leesburg. In 1848, Old Stone Church's congregation divided over the issue of slavery. Supporters of the Union created Leesburg Methodist Episcopal Church, North and supporters of the Confederacy created Leesburg Methodist Episcopal Church, South. In 1852, the southern congregation purchased property for $700 and established and built a new church building. That church building was refitted and used as a field hospital during the Civil War; it houses what is now known as the Leesburg United Methodist Church.</p>
<p>The hospital was necessary because a heated battle and many skirmishes took place in the surrounding area, including the Battle of Ball's Bluff. The United Methodist Church remained a hospital for the 7th Brigade at least from August 1861 through January 1862, it is unknown if it continued to be a field hospital following this time period.</p>
<p>The Leesburg Hospital was located where the Leesburg United Methodist Church stands today, at 107 West Market Street in downtown Leesburg.</p>
