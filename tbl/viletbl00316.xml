      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>In the 18th century, Cameron Parish created from Fairfax County's Truro Parish in 1748, was the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Anglican church in pre-revolutionary Virginia. (In English canon law, a parish is an area under the spiritual care of a priest. Not to be confused with the more commonly understood use of the word "parish" meaning a local "fully self-supporting congregation with a full-time priest.) Cameron Parish had jurisdiction over the western part of Fairfax County and with its creation in 1751 all of Loudoun County. Cameron Parish came from a minor title of Thomas, Lord Fairfax, Baron of Cameron. With the end of the Revolutionary War, the Episcopal Church in Virginia held its first assembly to organize the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Commonwealth of Virginia on 18 May 1784. On 22 December 1784 the Episcopal Church was incorporated in Virginia, with the Diocese of Virginia being created by 1790. Cameron Parish was followed by Shelbourne Parish in 1770 and these two parishes encompassed all of Loudoun County until 1840, when Meade Parish was created and named for the third Episcopal bishop of Virginia, William Meade (November 1789-March 1862). </p>
 <p>Emmanuel Church was consecrated on 21 July 1843, as part of Meade Parish and included Trinity Church in Upperville, VA. In 1853, Meade Parish was divided into two, to create Johns Parish for the eastern half of Loudoun County. Johns Parish was named for Bishop John Johns (July 1796- April 1876), fourth Episcopal bishop of Virginia. Emmanuel Church now became part of the newly created parish which also included Episcopalians of Aldie; who did not yet have their own church building but used a common building shared amongst other Protestant denominations in Aldie. The Church of Our Redeemer in Aldie was eventually built in 1890. Johns Parish now encompassed the towns of Upperville, Middleburg, and Aldie. </p>
 <p>Another reorganization happened in 1885 when Oatlands' Church of Our Savior became part of Johns Parish and Upperville reverted back to Meade Parish. </p>
 <p>The registers in this collection originally were in one large "Parish Register" but for ease of use by researchers, the pages have been separated into folders by church and location.
