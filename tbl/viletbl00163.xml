The news articles include discussion of plays and other events at Lincoln High School, sermons at the Friends Meetings, recipes, and handmade drawings of local activities.  These issues were kept by subscribers Franklin P. (1857-1946) and Elizabeth H. (n.d.-1948) Wilson, who had spent much of their early lives in Loudoun County.  A letter to Mrs. Wilson is also included, explaining that the student paper will not be continued during summer vacation.
