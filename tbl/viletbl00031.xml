<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The <title render="italic">Washington Times</title> newspaper was established in 1982, and quickly became a widely-circulated publication.  It has been read and lauded by many important political officials in Washington, including former presidents, and refers to itself as "America's Newspaper." </p>
<p>The <title render="italic">Times</title> began its "The Civil War" series in 1991.  It has had a number of frequent contributors, including John Hunt Morgan Roberts (d. 1999).  After more than a decade, the supplement continues to be published today.  </p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a">
<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>"The Civil War" newspaper articles span from July 6, 1996, to October 29, 2005.  Each supplement is published on a single page containing one to three articles.  The collection is in excellent condition.  
</p>
<p>The series is particularly concerned with anecdotes from Civil War soldiers, generals, and battles.  However, it also takes note of battlefields and other period historical sites that are currently vulnerable to encroaching development.  It contains notices of upcoming events, including battlefield commemorations and Civil War conferences in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia.  The series also includes Civil War book reviews, as well as articles concerning the medical, industrial, and technological advances that helped shape the war and its outcome.  </p>
<p>The Civil War articles are the only items in this collection.  </p>
