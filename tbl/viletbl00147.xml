<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Records are unclear about when Ashburn Colored School was started.  It was built on land distributed from the estate of John McComly (McCanerly) (ca. 1786-ca. 1867) between Anna Elizabeth Adrain (ca. 1808-?), who was his housekeeper, and her sons Peter E. Adrain (1837-after 1910) and James A. Adrain (1838-1915).  The Adrains are also identified in some documents as "Adrian."  In 1892 James A. and Olivia E. (1852-1940) Adrain sold two and one fourth acres to B.F. (Benjamin Franklin) Noland (1858-1939), who sold one half acre of the property to the Trustees for the Public Free Schools of Broad Run District, Loudoun County, VA.  
</p>
<p>In 1869 Virginia's General Assembly mandated public schools for all children in the commonwealth, with the stipulation that white and African American students would have separate facitilies.  In 1870 Loudoun County's first public schools opened with 55 schools - 46 for white students and 9 for African Americans.  In the early years of these public schools the county was divided into six districts: Leesburg, Mt. Gilead, Mercer, Jefferson, Lovettsville, and Broad Run. The County School Board of Loudoun County, Virginia sold the tract to John Kerns (1921-1960) in 1959 after the school closed.</p>
<p>It is unclear when the Ashburn Colored School was built, but the description  for insurance purposes in 1940 shows a one room frame building estimated to be 20 1/2' by 32 1/2' with three windows on two sides, heated by a wood stove.  The enrollment for the years 1920-1958 varied between 11 and 49.</p>
