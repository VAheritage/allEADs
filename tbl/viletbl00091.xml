<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>For many and varied reasons, prior to emancipation slaves sought freedom by running away. Federal laws&#8212;fugitive slave acts&#8212;were enacted to protect the right of slave owners to pursue runaway slaves by having them incarcerated and held until returned.  It was illegal for a free person to assist runaway slaves though some did.  Advertisements were placed by owners or their representatives in newspapers.  While these often appear only in the region of the runaway slaves many slave owners also posted advertisements in northern newspapers.  Virginia slave owners placed ads in the Maryland and Pennsylvania press. </p>
<p>Runaway slave advertisements have become a significant resource for historical research and can provide information useful for genealogical researchers.  Advertisements may include age, physical description, distinguishing characteristics, description of clothing, a given name and occasionally a family name, and a destination.</p>
<p>Jane D.  Wildman (1796-1880), nee Hamilton, was the widow of Enos Wildman (d.1829) a tavern keeper at Leesburg.  She was a resident of Loudoun County Virginia.  According to the 1860 US Census Wildman is listed with real property having a value of $23,000, personal property of $31,000 and 20 slaves.</p>
<p>C[harles] F[enton] Fadley/Fadeley (1818-1872) married to Orra Moore Drish (1823-1900) resided in Waterford, Virginia, where he was a farmer and livery stable keeper. According to the 1860 U S Census Fadely was a farmer with real property having a value of $12,000, personal property of $20,000 and 18 slaves.</p>
