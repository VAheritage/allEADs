<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Robert Lee Preston was born in Canada in 1863.  His parents, Thomas S. (1842-?) and Nannie E. (1844-?) Preston, were both United States citizens born in Virginia.  The family returned to Virginia some time during Preston's childhood.  Little information is available about the early years of his life.  He graduated from Hampden-Sydney College and the University of Virginia, and attended universities in Berlin and Leipzig.    Preston became headmaster of the University School, a boys prep school, in Washington, DC in 1891.  In 1912, he acquired Meadowbrook, a 400 acre farm outside of Leesburg, Virginia, which he operated as a boarding school for boys.  It is unclear when he closed the school.
</p>
<p>Preston married Leonora Johnston (1864-1952) and had two children, Leonora (1896-1968) and Elliott (ca. 1900-1978).  A collection of articles he wrote about the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln, Southern Miscellanies, was published in 1919.   Preston was involved with the establishment of Thomas Balch Library in 1922, serving as chairman of the board of trustees overseeing the library's construction.  Preston died 25 July 1941 in Leesburg.</p>
