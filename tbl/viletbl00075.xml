<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Harrison House, also known as the Glenfiddich House, is a well-known historic landmark in Leesburg, Virginia.  Named after its original owner, Henry T. Harrison (born 1797), the House's original section was built around 1780 and expanded during the early 1840s.  During the Civil War, it served as both a hospital and headquarters for the Confederate Army; Generals Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson (1824-1863) and Robert E. Lee (1807-1870) visited at the House.  Dr. Thomas Miller (died circa 1872), a prominent White House physician, and his family were relatives of the Harrisons and stayed at the House through much of the Civil War.  The diary of Virginia Miller (1842-still living 1900), his daughter, was discovered when the house was sold in 1980.  Janet LeHane, one of the new owners, transcribed it the diary.  </p>
<p>Harrison House was renovated in 1980 and today serves as the headquarters for the Miles LeHane Group, Inc., a career management company that provides assistance to high-tech firms, associations, and non-profit organizations.  </p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The diary of Miss Virginia J. Miller is a photocopy of a transcription and consists of various entries between 15 November 1861 and 17 April 1862.  It notes where diary pages are illegible or torn, and all pages are hole-punched.  Also included is a newspaper article entitled "The Harrison House in Leesburg" which describes the Harrison House's owners, architecture, and role in the Civil War.  This collection is in overall good condition but should be handled carefully.  </p>
<p>The diary begins on 15 November 1861, a Friday night.  Miller notes the arrival of the 21st Mississippi Regiment in Leesburg, as well as Union troop movements near Mathais Point and an exchange of high-ranking Union prisoners in return for Confederate privateers.  Succeeding entries describe military visitors to the Harrison House from the Albemarle Cavalry of Mississippi Regiments.  Miller discusses hearing cannonfire from the Battle of Ball's Bluff on October 21st, 1861 and witnessing the deaths and severe injuries of soldiers.  Miller declares herself particularly moved by the death of Colonel Erasmus Burt (circa 1820-1861), a well-known Mississippi doctor who was taken to the Harrison House after receiving a mortal gunshot wound during the battle.  Miller later writes of a military parade as Confederate troops moved to Centreville, and the naval victory of the Virginia (recorded on 17 April 1862).  Miller concludes the diary by describing a meeting with General Robert E. Lee at Point of Rocks, Maryland.</p>
<p>The diary and the newspaper article are the only items in this collection.    </p>
