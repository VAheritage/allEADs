<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Loudoun County, Virginia was a divided county in 1861, even prior to the outbreak of the Civil War. The southern and eastern portions of the county supported the South, while the northern and western portions of the county were sympathetic to the North. In April of 1861, in the days following the firing on Fort Sumter, the Virginia Convention debated and passed the Ordinance of Secession by an 85 to 55 vote. Loudoun County voted 1,626 to 726 for secession. Virginia's secession from the Union placed Loudoun not only on the border of two enemy nations, but also between two Union states, Maryland and West Virginia. 
</p>
<p>Loudoun County was a major crossroads for the Union and Confederacy with both armies traveling through the county at many points during the war. The county was the site for only one major battle, the Battle of Ball's Bluff. Many skirmishes, small actions, and raids took place in Loudoun, however. The county suffered the most devastation in late 1864 as a result of the "Burning Raid", when a division of Union soldiers were ordered to drive off livestock and burn barns and crops.</p>
<p>The Civil War ended on 6 April 1865 and Loudoun's civilian government was restored with their first post-war election on 1 June 1865. In 1872, Congress reimbursed many Union sympathizers in Loudoun County for property losses suffered during the war.</p>
