      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>The philatelic term for the envelope is cover, which originated from the initial purpose of covering the letter.  A First Day Cover (FDC) is the envelope that bears the stamp, location and cancellation indicating the first day of issue.  Generally, the location is determined as a result of its relationship to the subject matter on the stamp and often a ceremony is held as an introduction. Normally, the First Day of Cover will contain a cachet, a distinguishing text or illustration on the envelope that augments its significance and appearance.  A cachet can be a miniature work of art in itself. Cachets that are hand-painted are often produced in limited quantity and can be created using a variety of techniques including watercolor, colored pencil or acrylic. In many cases, the cachet appears on the left side but can also cover the entire front of the FDC.  In addition to the stamp itself, many collectors specialize in acquiring First Day Covers.  Rare FDCs can be valued at thousands of dollars.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection includes ArtCraft First Day Covers for five stamps produced to commemorate five significant Civil War events: the Firing on Fort Sumter, the Battle of Shiloh, the Battle of Gettysburg, the Battle of the Wilderness, and the Surrender at Appomattox. The stamps were produced between 1961 and 1965, and their release coincided with the anniversaries of the events.
</p>
      <p>Five of the cachets in this collection were produced by Washington Stamp Exchange, Inc., which was founded in 1932 by brothers Leo and Sam August as a stamp shop.  To commemorate the first flights of new airmail routes, they began to prepare specialty envelopes.  The success of the envelopes led to a greater interest by Leo August in developing First Day Covers which he produced working with various artists and using the Washington Stamp Exchange logo. After continued success with First Day Covers, the August brothers were introduced to Woodbury and Company, a fine engraving company in Massachusetts.  A working partnership was formed and Woodbury began producing engraved envelopes with cachets for the Washington Press (the "doing business as" name for the Washington Stamp Exchange, Inc).  The collaboration began on April 1, 1939 with the New York World's Fair stamp. "ArtCraft" was the brand name given to the engraved envelopes. The ArtCraft logo, which is the artist's palette and three brushes, became one of the best known in the country.  The business relationship between Washington Press and Woodbury continued until 2002 when Woodbury sold their presses to another engraver, The ArtCraft Company of North Attleboro. Although a fine engraving company in its own right, the ArtCraft Company of North Attleboro has no connection to ArtCraft First Day Covers which are now produced in house by Washington Press.</p>
      <p>The First Day Covers in this collection were created for Washington Press by Woodbury and Co. using a photogravure, a steel plate engraving printing process.  The Fort Sumter design is based on a print that appeared in Harper's Weekly; the image on the ArtCraft FDC has been reversed. The Battle of the Wilderness image is from a Currier &amp; Ives print.</p>
      <p>The collection also includes an envelope with a cachet commemorating the 125th and a cachet commemorating the 140th Anniversary of the Surrender at Appomattox (1865-2005).  Also included is a brief description describing the event and a map of General Robert E. Lee's surrender published by the Eastern National Park &amp; Monument Association, an organization supports mission of the National Park Service.</p>
