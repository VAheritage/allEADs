      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>American students of the late 18th and early 19th centuries often learned by recording lessons dictated by teachers in homemade copy books. This methodology extended to mathematical instruction, with students creating copybooks, also called "cipher books" or "sum books" that included handwritten explanations of mathematical concepts as well as completed practice excercises. Textbooks for arithmatic, algebra, and other types of math were published in the United States as early as 1729,  and include popular publications such as The Schoolmaster's Assistant by English author Thomas Dilworth (d. 1780) in 1773 and A New and Complete System of Arithmetic Composed for the Citizens of the United States published by Nicholas Pike (1743-1819) in 1788.  These textbooks were produced largely as teacher's aids, and included practical math used in every day life such as systems of measurement, compounding interest, and in the 1797 edition of Pike's book,  calculating the value of the United States' new Federal currency.  Copy books created by students in the course of their studies included carefully copied examples of standard mathematical problems and equations that could be used as a reference by the student later in life. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a manuscript book collecting mathematical notes and problems. Several pages include inscriptions such as "Thomas Williams" or "Thomas Williams, His Book, 1811."  The names "James" and "Craven"  also appear on the inside covers along with other doodles and pen marks. The volume has a hand sewn binding with a grey paper cover and thick rough cut paper pages. The first 52 pages are paginated, beginning with page 5. Mathematical concepts in the book include multiplication and division of integers,  long division, compound addition,  and decimal functions.  Various mercantile systems of measurement are also addressed such as the avoirdupois system, troy weights, apothecaries weights, and measurements for dry and liquid goods, cloth, and land.  Of note are pages explaining how to calculate with "Federal Funds" - dollars, cents, and mills. </p>
   
<p>The identity of the student who created this copy book is not clear. Several pages include the inscribed name "Thomas Williams." A Thomas Williams listed as a member of the Goose Creek Friends Meeting was banished in April 1791 from the meeting for marrying a woman outside of the Quaker faith. Goose Creek Friends Meeting Records indicate that by April 1791 Williams had relocated to Kentucky. Another Thomas Williams, aged between 16-25, living in Leesburg is recorded in the 1820 census. It is not possible to identify either individual as the author of this volume.
