<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>George R. Head (1822-1894) was a prominent political, business, and military
leader of Leesburg, Virginia. The son of George Head (1783-1870) and Mary 
Gover Head (1785-1823), he was one of six children from this marriage. After 
Head's mother's death in 1823, his father married Hannah J. Gover (1799-after 
1870). Both Head and his father served in the 57th Regiment of the VA Militia. In 
1848, Head married Sarah Virginia Gover (1823-before 1878), and the couple 
had six children, four who survived to adulthood: Ann 'Nannie' Head (1849-
after 1880), William Head (1852 - 1892), Rosellar Head Johnson (1853 - 1885), 
and Susan Virginia Head (1855 - 1912). He was a member of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church. Active in public life, Head served as a Justice of the Peace 
and as a member of the Leesburg Town Council beginning in 1858. He also 
established himself in business as a whitesmith or tinsmith, producing a number 
of goods including guns. In March 1861, he placed an advertisement in The 
Mirror announcing that he had just received "a fine lot of Colt's Revolvers which 
will be sold at reduced prices."
</p>
<p>Upon the occurrence of John Brown's raid of the government armory and arsenal
at Harpers Ferry on 16 October 1869, Charles B. Tebbs, among many others in 
Loudoun County, participated in raising a volunteer company 'The Loudoun 
Guard' for the protection of the border. This company, ostensibly attached to the 
57th Regiment (Loudoun County), Virginia Militia, was accepted into state service 
at Leesburg on 22 April 1861, under the command of Captain Tebbs. Head 
served as First Lieutenant. On 24 April 1861, the Loudoun Guard was ordered to 
proceed to Alexandria, Virginia, where it was officially mustered into service on 
23 May 1861, by Major George W. Brent (1821-1872) as part of the newly 
organized 17th Regiment Virginia Infantry. The next day the Loudoun Guard was 
sent to Manassas Junction and nearby Camp Pickens, where Captain Tebbs 
remained in command of the Loudoun Guard until June when he was promoted 
to Lieutenant Colonel and reassigned to the 8th Virginia Regiment. On June 29, 
1861, Head was appointed Captain of Company C of the 17th Virginia Infantry 
Regiment, one of ten companies in the newly formed unit. </p>
<p>As Captain, Head oversaw daily duty rosters, correspondence, and requisition
records for Company C dating between 1861 and April 1862. He also managed 
payroll, funds, and supplies for the company. He was noted for his actions on 18 
July 1861 at Blackburn's Ford just before the First Battle of Manassas. In his 
report of the action Colonel Montgomery D. Course noted "gallant conduct" of 
Head and four other officers "who were actively and fearlessly employed during 
the engagement" where "the fire was hottest." After this engagement the 17th 
Virginia was stationed at Camp Harrison near Fairfax Courthouse. The Regiment 
was reorganized at Yorktown, Virginia in April 1862 during the Siege of 
Yorktown. On 23 April 1862, Head narrowly avoided being struck by an exploding 
shell whole on duty at Dam Number 4. There is no record of Head incurring an 
injury during this incident. On 28 April 1862, Head was re-elected Captain of 
Company C, but resigned his commission shortly after his election.</p>
<p>In September of 1862 he was recommended for an appointment to the 
Ordinance Department. Created by the General Assembly of Virginia on 25 
January 1861, the Virginia Ordinance Department was leased to the Confederate 
Government and took charge of maintaining the Richmond Armory and 
manufacturing arms for the war effort. Head served the Ordinance Department in 
Lynchburg and at the Virginia Armory in Richmond until the end of the War. In 
January 1864 Head was sent to Lynchburg to investigate issues with the 
manufacture of "Williams Guns", a breech loading rapid fire canon first deployed 
by the Confederacy at the Battle of Seven Pines on 31 May 1862. Head 
confirmed the guns were defective. </p>
<p>Following the end of the Civil War, Head returned to Leesburg and established a 
business manufacturing stoves. He continued to be active in politics, serving as 
a Magistrate for the 8th District in 1868, as Mayor of Leesburg from 1869-1884 
and as a Town Councilman for more than 40 years. Head was an active 
Democrat, and was Chairman of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee 
from 1892-1894. He was regularly nominated as a candidate for the House of 
Delegates, winning elections in 1879 and 1890. In 1885 and 1886 he was 
appointed to serve as Leesburg's Postmaster by President Grover Cleveland 
(1837-1908). Head was active in the Clinton Hatcher Camp of Confederate 
Veterans and in fraternal organizations. He was a Mason and was elected as a 
Grandmaster of the Oddfellows in 1869. His death was recorded in the 1 
February 1894 edition of The Mirror with an obituary entitled "A Valuable Citizen 
Passes Away." Head is buried in Union Cemetery. </p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The George R. Head collection consists of materials created or collected by
Captain George R. Head (1822-1894) of Leesburg, Virginia. The collection 
includes family correspondence and papers, military correspondence and 
records, publications, currency and ephemera. The collection also contains 
artifacts including a canteen, haversack, holster, belt and buckles used by Head 
during the American Civil War. A 2005 inventory of documents, typed 
transcriptions of selected letters and documents in the collection, and research 
related to George R. Head's confederate military service accompanies the 
collection. </p>
<p>Family correspondence and papers are arranged chronologically and date from 
1847-1897. Correspondence includes letters to and from family members and 
from Head's fellow Odd Fellows and Masonic Lodge members. Of note are 
letters sent by Head to his wife Sarah Gover Head during June and July of 1862. 
Other Loudoun county correspondents include George Head's brother Reverend 
Nelson Head (1811 -1902), George W. Janney (1821-1873), and Edward 
Nichols (1847-1923). Family papers contain a handwritten funeral announcement 
for Lydia Head (fl. 1775 -1832), paternal grandmother of George R. Head and 
epitaphs drafted for his wife Sarah Virginia Gover and for her father, Samuel 
Gover, Jr. (1795-1875). </p>
<p>The bulk of the collection relates to Head's military service, first with the 57th 
Regiment, Virginia Militia, at the outset of the Civil War as 1st Lieutenant in the 
Loudoun Guard and later as Captain of Company C, of the Virginia 17th Infantry 
Regiment. Included are daily rosters, correspondence, and requisition records 
for the Company C dating between 1861 and April 1862 when Head resigned his 
commission. In September of 1862 he was recommended for an appointment to 
the Ordinance Department. Correspondence and records from Head's Ordinance 
Department service are included in the collection. Letters relating to the Head's 
investigation of inherent problems with Williams Guns are of particular note. 
Other Civil War era materials include pamphlets, currency, and other ephemera 
such as postal covers. Artifacts in the collection also relate to Head's military 
service. Included are a canteen, haversack, holster, belt, belt buckles, and five 
buttons used or worn by Head during the American Civil War. The canteen is 
particularly unique. The design is similar to other tin drum canteens issued by the 
Confederacy in 1861; however, Head's canteen features a hand-drawn image of 
the seal of Virginia including the motto Sic Semper Tyrannis and the figures of 
Virtus and Tyrannus. Two small leather coin purses are also in the collection. </p>
