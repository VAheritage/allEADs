      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Frederick Douglass Elementary School, built in 1958 to educate African American students during segregation in Loudoun County, was the only elementary school for African Americans until 1968 when Loudoun County schools fully integrated. It continued to serve as an integrated elementary school until 1982. From 1982-2001 the site was used as a community center where programs like Head Start and special education programs were held. After 2001 the building did not hold classes, programs, or activities, but was used for school board offices and storage. In 2010 Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) began considering demolishing the original school structure. The decision was a controversial one, and the public school system, with encouragement from community members and organizations, commissioned several reports on the school's history and architectural significance. LCPS ultimately decided to tear down the school building, but to name the replacement elementary school Frederick Douglass.
</p>
      <p>As part of an effort to preserve the history of Frederick Douglass Elementary School for the Leesburg community, LCPS worked with several community-wide organizations including the Black History Committee of the Friends of Thomas Balch Library, the Town of Leesburg's Planning and Zoning Department, and the Department of African and African American Studies at George Mason University, to record oral histories with students, teachers, and administrators of Frederick Douglass Elementary School. They interviewed twelve members of the community in 2011 and 2012. Some of the interviewees attended or worked at the school during segregation, while some were involved with the school much later. One of the interviewees is Fred Drummond, principal of the school from the time it opened in 1958 until the school integrated in 1968. The interviewees discuss life in Leesburg over the years, their love for the school, and its importance to Leesburg, especially the African American community. LCPS then used the oral histories to create a video commemorating the original Frederick Douglass Elementary School and to create a permanent display at the new school. The video was shown at the dedication of the new Frederick Douglass Elementary School on 11 October 2012.</p>
