      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, exhibitions (such as world's fairs) hosted by various American cities drew visitors from all over the United States and the world. The Panama-Pacific International Exhibition held in 1915 brought over 18 million people to San Francisco, California to witness attractions such as "palaces" dedicated to technological, scientific, artistic, and cultural achievements, a "Joy Zone" with amusement park rides, attractions, and concessions, and pavilions dedicated to a variety of nations (National Park Service). As Laura Ackley notes, the San Francisco exhibition served a dual purpose - "In name, the celebration would commemorate the United States' completion of the Panama Canal. More importantly to the city, and to California, it was intended to replace in the eyes of the world the image of a destroyed San Francisco" in the wake of the devastating 1906 earthquake and fire ("An Introduction to the Panama-Pacific International Exhibition").</p>
