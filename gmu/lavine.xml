      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Born in Boston, Massachusetts, on February 12, 1915, Thelma Z. Lavine taught philosophy for over 40 years, mostly at universities in the Washington, D.C. area. Her teaching career began after she received doctoral degrees in Psychology and Philosophy from Harvard University in 1939. Prior to that, she completed an undergraduate degree at Radcliffe College in 1936. A popular lecturer, she taught at the University of Maryland in the 1950s and 1960s, then accepted a teaching position at George Washington University. She joined the faculty at George Mason University as a Robinson Professor in 1985 and taught there until she retired in 1998. </p>
      <p>An active and well-respected philosophy professor, Lavine served in many organizations, including as president of the Washington Philosophy Club, on the Executive Committee of the Society for Advancement of American Philosophy, and on the Ralph Waldo Emerson Committee of the United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
      <p>Lavine was trained by, knew, and debated well-known philosophers including Richard Rorty, John Dewey, C.I. Lewis, Susanne Langer, Hannah Arendt, Paul Weiss, and Kurt Wolff. After she moved to Washington, DC from Boston, one of her projects was to make American Philosophy relevant to students. In addition to advocating for the controversial American branch of philosophy, Lavine produced scholarship on social philosophy, philosophy of the social sciences, American naturalism, philosophy of history, and philosophy in literature.</p>
      <p>A widely published author, she popularized philosophy with her 30-part series "From Socrates to Sartre: The Philosophic Quest," which aired first on Maryland Public Television and then nationally in the early 1980s. Her book of the same name was published in 1984 and is still in print. Lavine died at her home in Washington, D.C., on January 28, 2011.</p>
