      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>The Garrick Players began by performing at the Grace Episcopal Church, (1041 Wisconsin Avenue), in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington D.C., beginning in the late 1960s. Admission to the plays was affordable, allowing for a large part of the population to experience the performances. The group took it's name after the 18th century actor David Garrick who would meet with his audience after performances. In a similar vein the Garrick Players would encourage audiences to share coffee with them after seeing a play. The theatre group began in December of 1965 and was organized by Gerald (Jerry) Slavet, a graduate of Boston Latin School, Bowdoin College, and Catholic University. The Players originally consisted of Slavet and five professional actors and actresses. The group toured U.S. Army bases in Europe during the summer of 1966. In 1968, Slavet moved to Virginia to direct at the Wayside Theatre in Middletown.</p>
