            <p>The East German government created posters to promote a wide variety of events and anniversaries. The locations of these events varied from indoor locations, such as museums, to outdoor locations, such as recreation areas. The posters list sponsoring organizations as well as dates and times. The anniversary posters often contain artwork with no specific mention of activities, perhaps indicating that the posters were created more for a general awareness, such as the anniversary of Berlin, rather than listing specific events associated with the anniversary. This idea of a general awareness is the purpose of the fitness posters that encourage exercise, especially for children, and there is somewhat of a propaganda angle to these as well. The posters typically had multiple organizations responsible for their creation, usually a government agency and an advertising agency. Artists were also involved with the creation of the posters, and in some cases multiple artists collaborated on one poster.</p>

            <p>The culture and science series consists 181 posters that were used to advertise for a variety of events. There are also posters that advertise for attractions, such as zoos, that do not mention specific activities. The event posters usually list dates, times, and other information for potential attendees. The posters range in size from 20 x 57 cm to 56 x 80 cm with most measuring 56 x 80 cm. Most of the posters date from the 1980s.</p>
            <p>The design of the posters are largely abstract art, a collage of photographs, or representations real-life activities such as sporting events. The posters for sports events are invitations for participants and for spectators. Some of the sports posters encourage youth fitness. A large number of the posters advertise for a variety of festivals and anniversary celebrations. The festivals tend to be music or literary, and the anniversaries are mostly for cities and towns to recognize a significant number of years of existence. There are also posters that encourage tourism of towns, institutions, and outdoor urban venues. The institutions represented in the posters are largely scientific in nature including museums and zoos. One of the subjects that appears across the various posters is motorcycles. There are posters that advertise for races as well as posters that simply advertise for a specific brand of motorcycle. There are also multiple images of birds in the posters for the zoos as well as in the posters that advertise for events.</p>
