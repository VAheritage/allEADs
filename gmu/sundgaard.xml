      <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Arnold Olaf Sundgaard was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, on October 31, 1909. He studied English at the University of Wisconsin and then drama at Yale University. Sundgaard taught at many colleges including the University of Texas, Columbia University in New York, Bennington College, and at Trinity College in Dublin.</p>
      <p>Sundgaard worked for the Chicago Federal Theatre Project and is best known in this context as the writer of the Living Newspaper production Spirochete. He worked with the FTP from 1936 to 1938 as an author and play reader, after which he was let go since he was starting to make a living as a writer. The main theme of Spirochete is the history and spread of syphilis from the 15th century in Europe to the 1930s in America. The play was politically minded and current in relation to the Marriage Test Law of 1937. This Law would require a blood test for syphilis prior to marriage. The play opened in Chicago on April 29, 1938, and had showings in Seattle, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, and Portland, Oregon during February of 1939. Even though the play was met with protest in some areas due to its controversial subject matter, it was the second most performed Living Newspaper play after One-Third of a Nation.</p>
      <p>After working with the FTP Sundgaard went on to be a successful writer and librettist. As an author he wrote articles, lyrics, plays, and children's books. To his credit are articles for The New Yorker, and the Atlantic; libretti for Down in the Valley by Kurt Weill, and The Greenfield Christmas Tree; plays such as Giants in the Earth (co-written with Douglas Moore), Everywhere I Roam, the Broadway produced Of Love Remembered, Promised Valley, Forests of the Night, The Great Campaign, and Young Abe Lincoln; children's books include An Axe, an Apple, and a Buckskin Jacket, The Lamb and the Butterfly, and Jethro's Difficult Dinosaur.</p>
      <p>Sundgaard died in Dallas, Texas, on October 22, 2006.</p>
