         <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
         <p>John Preston, eldest son of William and Susanna (Smith)
         Preston, was born in 1764 at "Greenfield" in Botetourt County,
         Virginia. He periodically served in the Virginia militia
         throughout his lifetime. Preston was elected a member of the
         Virginia House of Delegates, representing Botetourt County in
         1783, as well as Montgomery County in 1791 and again in
         1803-1804. He served as a member of the Virginia Senate from
         1792- 1799.</p>
         <p>In 1792, Preston was named as a trustee in the act that
         established Christiansburg, Virginia in 1792, and served as a
         clerk of its first Board of Trustees. In 1798 he served as a
         trustee in the act that established Blacksburg, Virginia. In
         1795, Preston became a Lieutenant Colonel, commanding the
         Third Regiment of Artillery. In 1799, he was elected Brigadier
         General, and given command of the brigade for Wythe,
         Montgomery, and Monroe Counties.</p>
         <p>Later in 1810, Preston was appointed by the Virginia
         General Assembly to be the Treasurer of Virginia, serving
         until 1819. An audit of the treasurer's books found that
         Preston's accounts were in arrears, and a judgement was issued
         against Preston for 87 thousand dollars. To meet the
         obligation, Preston transferred a number of properties to
         trustees, who were to oversee their sale and the payment of
         funds into the treasury.</p>
         <p>Preston married Mary Radford in 1798, and after her death
         in 1810, married Eliza Ann Carrington Mayo in 1811. He had
         seven children with his first wife and one with his second.
         When not on active military duty, Preston resided at
         "Smithfield" with his mother until his marriage, after which
         he lived at "Horseshoe". He died at Greenfield in 1827.</p>
