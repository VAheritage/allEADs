            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>The Blakely and Hamilton Livery appeared to be a prominent business in Warm Springs, VA. The ledger books are very detailed and indicate a booming business in the early 20th century. The first "Day Book" in the collection dated Aug. 27th, 1914 includes historical information on a wide range of topics: list of Presidents, “In Case of Accidents” procedure, “Antidotes for Poisons”, Legal Weights: Pounds per Bushel of items, Domestic Weights and Measures, Business Law in Daily Use, Quantity of Seed Required to Plant an Acre, Interest Laws and Statutes of Limitations, Weight per Bushel of Grain, Etc., Carrying Capacity of a Freight Car, Short Method for Calculating Interest, and Compound Interest on One Dollar for 100 Years.</p>
            <p>Very little information could be found about John E. Criser, the owner of most of the ledgers in Series II, but his grave was found in Warm Springs, Bath County, Virginia. He was born on July 21, 1877 and died on December 9, 1940, dating him at about 30-40 years old when these ledgers were kept. He was married to Myrtle B. Criser (1876-1953).</p>
            <p>Lastly, the Day Book highlighting the 116th Infantry provides much historical information about the formation of Infantry Divisions in Virginia during World War I as well as information on popular culture of the time including songs, dances, books, etc. The 29th Infantry Division, of which the 116th infantry was a member, was deployed to France as part of the American Expeditionary Force during World War I. They were nicknamed "The Blue and Gray" because the division comprised of soldiers from both previously Union and Confederate states.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The Warm Springs, Virginia, Ledgers collection includes 26 ledgers divided that account for the business of John E. Criser, J. S. Kelley, Blakey and Hamilton Co., and Yancey and Faulkner, as well as others in and around the town of Warm Springs. Ledgers date from 1884-1942, but the majority are from 1900-1920. The various companies appear to have done assorted business with each other as they appear sporadically in each other's ledgers.</p>
            <p>This collection of ledgers documents small businesses from the late 19th century to the 20th century. The records provide insight not only to the businesses themselves but also a generalization of how business was run, prices for individual items, types of things a business would sell, etc. In addition to the records themselves, many of the items contain other pieces of information of importance to the businesses: wage earnings, population and demographic statistics, currency, tax returns, etc.</p>
            <p>Several of the daybooks also historical information on a variety of topics, including general and local history. One daybook has documentation of the 116th infantry and the members of the "Federal Street Bunch" from Petersburg. From information gathered, this "Bunch" was a company from Petersburg, VA with members from across the state that joined the 116th U.S. Infantry, party of the 29th Infantry Division during the first World War. Another daybook contains biographical details of about 20 boys including age, birth place, popular songs, dances, books, sayings, etc. of that time period.</p>
