            <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
            <p>John W. Jellison was a private in the 27th Maine Infantry, Company E, on September
                30, 1862. He mustered out in June 1863.</p>
            <p>The 27th Maine was notable for soldiers voluntarily staying beyond their original
                enlistment period in 1863 to guard Washington D.C. against Lee's offensive into
                Pennsylvania. However, these volunteers only remained in defense of the capitol for
                four days and returned to Maine in time to muster out with the rest of the regiment.
                Still, Congress awarded the entire regiment of more than 850 men the Medal of Honor.
                The awards were purged by Congress in 1917 as the "actions of the regiment did not
                meet the criteria for receiving such a medal." Although the medals were not taken
                away, the names of the recipients were stricken from the roll. </p>

        <scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a">
            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The collection contains seven letters written by Jellison to his wife and his mother.
                In addition, the collection includes Jellison's his discharge papers. </p>
            <p>Despite the short duration of his service, Jellison's letters were written from a
                variety of locations in Virginia, Washington, DC, and aboard the gun boat St. Louis.
                All the letters are dated, but not all include the year, so the sequence is unclear.
                For the most part, Jellison writes of his regiments marches and camps, and news of
                the war from nearby regions. </p>
            <p>Excerpt from December 15, 1862, Camp Vermont Near Alexandria: "...We had a pleasant
                time on picket we took three prisoners we had to shoot one. It was hared to stand
                and see a man shot down it was on my post and I ordered it was my duty to do
                so..."</p>

        <arrangement encodinganalog="351">
            <head>Arrangement</head>
            <p>The correspondence is arranged in its likely chronological sequence, based on the
                movements of Jellison's regiment in 1862 and 1863. Discharge papers are filed after
                the letters.</p>
