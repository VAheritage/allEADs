            <p>Robert "Bobby" E. Hord Jr. was born in 1920 to Gladys Bauer Hord and Robert E. Hord
                Sr. in Richmond, Virginia. Robert Hord Jr. attended class at the Richmond branch of
                the Virginia Polytechnic Institute Engineering Extension Division from 1937 to
                1939.</p>
            <p>Hord enlisted in the Army in April of 1942 and was assigned to Company G, 2nd
                Battalion of the 302nd Ordinance Regiment. Hord completed his training at numerous
                bases throughout the United States including: Camp Sutton in Monroe, North Carolina;
                Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Camp Young in Indio, California; Camp Pickett, Virginia,
                and Camp McCain in Mississippi. While he was serving in Mississippi, Hord received a
                much-anticipated transfer to Company A of the 758th Railway Shop Battalion. He spent
                a brief period at Camp Harrahan in New Orleans, Louisiana where the battalion was
                activated before being transferred to Camp Millard in Bucyrus, Ohio to complete
                training. In December of 1943, Hord and the rest of the 758th were sent overseas to
                Dibrugarh, Assam, India. Hord spent the remainder of his service in the
                China-Burma-India theater before returning state-side for discharge in November of
                1945.</p>
            <p>After the war, Robert Hord Jr. completed his studies at VPI receiving a Bachelor of
                Science in Mechanical Engineering in 1949 and continuing to complete a Masters in
                Power and Fuel Engineering in 1950. Hord spent the remainder of his life living in
                Richmond, Virginia and channeling his love for the railroad into a successful career
                working for the Norfolk and Western Railroad and later, the Richmond,
                Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad. Robert Hord, Jr. died on December 13,
                2010.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The Robert E. Hord Jr. papers have been devided into two series based upon material type. Series I consist primarily of letters written by Robert E. Hord Jr. to his parents, Robert and Gladys Hord while serving in the army during World War II. Also present are two letters written to Robert Hord Jr. by "Cousin Otto" and Al Bungardner. There are a few letters written to Robert Hord Jr.'s parents on Robert's behalf. Also included are newspapers and advertisements which were included with Robert's letters home.</p>
            <p>The majority of the letters speak directly to Hord's mother and center around
                discussions of camp life and the types of equipment he is working on while serving
                with the 302nd Ordinance Regiment. There are extensive discussions of Hord's efforts
                to secure a transfer the the Railway Shop Battalion. After the transfer, the letters
                settle into a kind of routine discussion of interesting events in camp, the types of
                trains he is working on, and responses the homefront news that his mother shares
                with him in her letters. The letters offer a unique perspective on the war and a
                glimpse into camp life for soldiers stations in the China-Burma-India theater during
                World War II.</p>
<p>Series II of the collection consists of a scrapbook and loose photographs of the Hord family. Photographs include Mr. and Mrs. Granville Hord, Robert Hord's grandparents. The scrapbook includes images from the campus of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and images of the camp where Hord was stationed in India. The majority of individual photographs are unidentified.</p>
