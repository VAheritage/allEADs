      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>William W. Barnett was born in Pennsylvania on 15 September 1840 and raised in Armstrong
        Co. in western Pennsylvania by parents Alexander and Hannah Barnett. The 1860 census shows
        him living in the Borough of Freeport of that county as a 19 year-old student with his
        parents; brothers Henry B. (age 21), Robert A. (age 10), Hezekiah W. (age 9); and sister
        Emily W. (age 16). He enlisted as a private in Co. A, 8th Pennsylvania Reserve Volunteer
        Corps (PRVC), also known as the 37th Volunteers, on 15 May 1861, a few days after his
        brother Henry enlisted in Co. G, 9th PRVC. The 8th and the 9th saw duty in and around
        Washington D.C., before marching to Hunter's Mill in Fairfax Co. on 10 March 1862 and
        returning to Alexandria four days later. Barnett would see action in Virginia during June at
        Mechanicsville and Gaines Mill in the Seven Days Campaign and, later that summer, at the
        second battle of Bull Run. Before his regiment engaged at Antietam in mid-September 1862,
        Barnett fell ill and was left behind at Harewood Hospital in Northeast Washington on the
        farm of W. W. Corcoran. On 27 September, he was assigned to duty as a nurse at the hospital,
        and though he would become sick again before the end of 1862, he would finish the year
        serving at the hospital. He was discharged from service with the rank of private on a
        Surgeon's Certificate on 20 March 1863, some three months after his brother Henry was
        similarly discharged.</p>
      <p>After, presumably, returning home to western Pennsylvania, Barnett responded to the local
        call to form the 5th Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery (also known as the 204th Regiment,
        Pennsylvania Volunteers) in August 1864. He was mustered in as a private, Battery M, on 2
        September 1864. The regiment saw duty in the defense of Washington and along the Manassas
        Gap Railroad with engagements following at Salem and Rectortown in October 1864 before
        returning to Washington. Barnett was promoted to Sergeant and on 19 January 1865 was
        promoted to Second Lieutenant. He returned to Pittsburgh and mustered out with his battery
        on 30 June 1865. </p>
      <p>Very little of Barnett's later life is known. An annotation added at a later date to
        Barnett's 1862 diary entry for 29 January reads, "Son of W. W. Barnett Wyllie Barnett was
        born January Friday 29 1875 - W. W. Barnett died Tuesday September 29 1876." A pension claim
        filed on 18 September 1890 by his widow cites the date of his death as Sept. 26 1876. As to
        the identity of his wife, nothing is known for certain, although the 1880 census does show a
        Rebecca Barnett living in the eastern Ohio county of Tuscarawas with her parents, Thomas and
        Sarah Laughead along with her five-year-old son, William Barnett. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a single diary with one-page entries for the year of 1862. A
        few pages of memoranda follow on which Barnett has listed miscellaneous clothing expenses
        and his pay record for the year. The diary describes his time in hospital in January and
        February, as well as from September through December. These latter entries include his work
        as a nurse, particularly tending to the wounded following the battle of Fredericksburg in
        December 1862. Camp life and routine, visits with his brother Henry, and brief trips into
        Washington D.C. are among the topics mentioned. Barnett also mentions review of the division
        by President Lincoln, General McDowell, and Secretary Stanton in May near Fredericksburg and
        again by Lincoln and McClellan in July near Harrison's Landing. The diary includes
        descriptions of battle at Mechanicsville, Gaines' Mill, Frazier's Farm, and Malvern Hill in
        the Seven Day's campaign and at the Second Battle of Bull Run.</p>
