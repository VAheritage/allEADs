      <p>John William Ryland was born on October 19, 1836 in King and Queen County, VA. He was the
        first of three children born to Joseph and Priscilla Bagby Ryland. He attended Richmond
        College and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1858. Robert Ryland, John's uncle,
        served as the school's first president from 1840-1866. John worked as a farmer and
        colporteur until he was 24 and talk of war came to King and Queen County. </p>
      <p>On May 29, 1861, he joined the Army of the Confederate States of America and was placed in
        Company K, 34th Virginia Infantry. Ryland was promoted from Corporeal to Sergeant on July
        18, 1861, and he was wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines in May 1862. He recovered at the
        Richmond College Hospital and returned to his regiment in July 1862. In 1865, Sergeant
        Ryland follows General Robert E. Lee toward Sailor's Creek in Amelia County, and on to
        Appomattox for the South's final effort. </p>
      <p>Following the Civil War, John became a minister of Gospel. He served at the Baptist Church
        in Bruington, VA, and Hermitage Baptist Church in Church View, VA for 32 years. He married
        Lucy Fleet (Roane) Bagby on July 24, 1866 and later they had two sons. He passed away on

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The J. W. Ryland Diary consists of a single Civil War diary kept by J. W. Ryland between
        September 1863-1865. In his diary, Ryland records activities from September 1863 – January
        1866. His entries include the topics of the creation of the Confederate States of America,
        rail cars, and battles such as the Siege of Charleston, SC, the Siege of Petersburg, the
        Battle of Sailor's Creek, the surrender at Appomattox Court House, and the weary Confederate
        trek home following April 9, 1865. Other entries explain how he has taken it upon his own
        shoulders to enhance the spiritual life of his fellow soldiers. Although the Confederate
        States of America surrendered on April 9, 1865, Ryland continued to write about his support
        for them. In a diary entry dated 1865, Ryland says "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) in the
        presence of Almighty God that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend the
        Constitution of the United States." </p>
      <p>There are newspaper clippings attached to the inside of the front and back covers. These
        clippings include a woman writing to her sisters about not being too eager over the men
        coming back from war, a report of a French chemist's discovery, a poem entitled "The Young
        Widow" and a printing of "General Orders No. 30 217." </p>
