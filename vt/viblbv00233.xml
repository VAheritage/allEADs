<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The 1900 U. S. census lists S. Harvey Johnson, a 45-year-old preacher, living in Tunstall District, Patrick County, Virginia.

<p>Paul Hamilton Hayne was born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1830. After graduating from the College of Charleston in 1852, he established a law practice but soon abandoned it to pursue a literary career. During the Civil War, he served in the Confederate Army. Though he published numerous collections of his poetry, Hayne is more widely remembered for his work as a literary critic and magazine editor. He died at his home, Copse Hill, in Grovetown, Georgia, in 1886.</p>
