            <p>The bulk of the drawings in the Willis Papers were arranged and described before they were donated, and information about the arrangement of the collection was compiled in a searchable database that is available at the repository. Project records stored in record cartons have been inventoried and are included in the database and finding aid.</p>
            <p>The first accession, which was arranged and described by Laura Katz Smith in 1995, was combined with subsequent accessions in 2003. A finding aid describing the complete collection was created by Catherine G. OBrion in 2003, using descriptions of materials in the archives database that was donated with the bulk of the collection in 2000. The 2004 and 2009 additions were arranged and described by Sherrie Bowser in 2012. The project index arrangement was also included at this time.</p>

            <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
            <p>Beverly Willis, FAIA Architect, artist, and writer, was one of perhaps three women architects in the United States to own her own sizeable architecture firm between 1958 and 1990 and the only woman in San Francisco, California, to have her own practice there for 17 years. Her book, 
                <title render="italic">Invisible Images: The Silent Language of Architecture,</title> published by the National Building Museum, describes her design philosophy.</p>
            <p>She was the first woman appointed to the Building Research Advisory Board of the National Academy of Science, the first appointed to the Federal Construction Council, and its first woman chair. She was the first woman elected president of the American Institute of Architects, California Council; and the Golden Gate Chapter of Lambda Alpha Society.</p>
            <p>Willis played a major role in the revitalization of San Francisco neighborhoods after World War II. She renovated commercial spaces in the Jackson Square area and Union Street, redesigned Glide Church, designed the San Francisco Ballet Building, and won an international competition to design the Yerba Buena Gardens development downtown.</p>
            <p>Beverly Willis was born February 17, 1928, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to Ralph William Willis, founder of the National Tool Company, and Margaret Elizabeth Porter, a nurse. She had one sibling, Ralph Gerald Willis. Both Willis and her brother were placed in an orphanage when their parents divorced in 1934.</p>
            <p>Taking advantage of the increased opportunities available to women with the advent of World War II, Willis learned welding, riveting, electrical wiring, carpentry, and how to fly an airplane--skills that reflected the fiercely independent qualities that emerged in her personality when she was in the institutional environment of the orphanage. After the war, she enrolled in an aeronautical engineering program at Oregon State University, but withdrew after two years to work at a lithographer's studio. She then studied at the San Francisco Art Institute until relocating to Hawaii. In 1954 she received a B.A. in Fine Art from the University of Hawaii.</p>
            <p>After graduation, Willis received a series of design commissions that led to her interest in architecture. Fueled by the friendship and ideas of entrepreneur Henry Kaiser, Willis returned to San Francisco in 1960 to open a firm that designed furniture and interiors for offices, created mixed-media art for clients that included United Airlines, and re-worked supermarket displays. Despite her rural sensibility, Willis began to immerse herself in urban designs. She found that her interests ran parallel to those of San Francisco architects like William Wurster and Joseph Esherick.</p>
            <p>Willis' first major architectural project was the conversion of three Victorian buildings into a retail complex on Union Street in San Francisco. Her design, which proved a financial success almost immediately, influenced the renovation of the rest of the street between present-day Gough and Pierce streets.</p>
            <p>Meeting the experience and education requirements of the California State Architectural Licensing Board in 1966, Willis became a licensed architect and the only woman in San Francisco with her own firm, Beverly Willis and Associates. This firm assumed a partnership with would-be principal architect David Coldoff that year, a partnership that lasted until 1980. Despite the heavy demands of her practice, Willis also found time to serve on the U.S. Government delegation to the United Nations conference on Habitat, become a trustee and founder of the National Building Museum in 1976, and serve as the President of the California Chapter of the National Institute of Architects in 1979.</p>
            <p>Willis' interest in the issues that affect planning, population density, and land-use economics with respect to large-scale development manifested itself in the creation of the computer program CARLA (Computerized Approach to Residential Land Analysis) in the 1970's. The software was developed by Willis with Eric Tiescholz and Jochen Eigen. With CARLA's completion and implementation, Willis and Associates became one of the first architectural firms to incorporate computers into the routine practices of design and land development.</p>
            <p>Projects such as the prototype for the regional computer centers of the IRS and master-planning for a new town situated in Aliamanu Valley, Hawaii (1975), are good examples of her unique philosophy of design.</p>
            <p>Throughout the 1970s, Willis' firm concentrated on large- scale housing and new-community planning and design. By espousing architecture of rural pragmatism and rooting it in ancient images and myths, Willis offered something new to the intellectual landscape of architectural design.</p>
            <p>In 1997, the National Building Museum published Willis' book, 
                <title render="italic">Invisible Images: The Silent Language of Architecture,</title> in which she describes her buildings and design philosophy. In 1980, she was elected to the American Institute of Architects College of Fellows. In 1984, Willis received an honorary doctorate in Fine Arts from Mount Holyoke College.</p>
            <p>By the early 1980s, Willis' design focus shifted to urban structures like the Yerba Buena Gardens redevelopment project (1980) and the San Francisco Ballet Association Building (1984). Smaller, but no less important, projects include Nob Hill Court (1971), Pacific Point Condominiums (1972), the Greenwich Apartment (1978), the Margaret Hayward Playground Building (1978), the (unbuilt) Shown Winery (1986), and the Mr. and Mrs. Richard Goeglin Pool House and Sculpture (1988).</p>
            <p>Willis relocated her office and residence to New York City in 1991. Willis founded in 1994 the 
                <extref title="Architectural Research Institute, Inc." href="http://www.architect.org">Architectural Research Institute, Inc.</extref> (through which the Manhattan Village Academy was designed). In 2002, she founded the 
                <extref title="Beverly Willis Architecture Foundation" href="http://www.bwaf.org/">Beverly Willis Architecture Foundation</extref>, and she presently (2008) serves as the foundation's president. Her work and community leadership have been widely published (see bibliography). She is a founding trustee of the National Building Museum (1975-present). The Beverly Willis Library is located at the National Building Museum.</p>

            <p>The Beverly Willis Architectural Collection span the years 1954 to 1999 and are comprised primarily of records documenting Willis' work as an architect in San Francisco between 1960 and 1990. The collection documents the application of computers to architectural design and land analysis, the development of CARLA (Computerized Approach to Residential Land Analysis) in the 1970s, the history of twentieth-century urban planning, particularly in San Francisco; and the contribution of women to twentieth-century American architecture. Willis, a noted artist, photographer, teacher, and writer, employed the full range of visual arts and design skills to influence and guide architectural projects of major significance.</p>
            <p>The bulk of the collection is comprised of Willis and Associates project files from the period 1960 to 1990. Projects range from private residences and residential developments to institutions, such as the San Francisco Ballet Association Building; and urban development projects, most notably the Yerba Buena Gardens project in downtown San Francisco. Also included are records and design documents for Aliamanu Valley New Town, a military base in Hawaii that was the first major project designed with CARLA, computer software for architectural design created by Willis; and records documenting the development of CARLA.</p>
            <p>Project files are comprised of presentation drawings, slope analysis drawings, site plans, maps, cut-and-fill analysis plans, sketches, conceptual design drawings, construction drawings, as well as correspondence, research files, contracts, environmental impact statements and studies, financial records, and feasibility studies. There are records for more than 150 projects. Drawings are large folio, pen-and- ink or watercolor on paper, linen, or mylar. Some are heightened with color.</p>
            <p>Also included is a series documenting the development of CARLA, Computerized Approach to Residential Land Analysis, in the 1970s. Beverly Willis was interested in issues that affected planning, population density, and land-use economics in relation to large-scale development. Along with Eric Tiescholz and Jochen Eigen, she developed a program that enabled architects, with the use of computers, to develop site plans and design techniques in a fraction of the time required by the old methodology. Records documenting the development of CARLA include computer tapes, correspondence, flow charts, memos, and Jochen Eigen's notes on interfacing CARLA with a computer mapping program in 1974.</p>
            <p>The collection also contains a series of Publications, Brochures, and Clippings, which includes biographical information on Willis, Miscellaneous Project Records, and a video of the Yerba Buena Gardents development.</p>

                            <p>Design, construction drawings and supervision for renovation and restoration of an 1855 one-room school house into a 3-bedroom residence in Volcano, California.</p>
                            <p>Extended Description: A "ghost town" three hours from San Francisco, Volcano, California, was once home to 10,000 miners that worked the original mother-lode of the gold rush. When Willis first saw the deteriorating buildings in the early sixties, the town's one hundred residents survived on weekend tourist trade.</p>
                            <p>Built in 1855, a one-room schoolhouse with boarded up bell tower and crumbling foundations was redesigned by Willis as her personal weekend retreat. Gutting the interior, Willis created a two-story living area in one half of the space, and stacked a master bedroom suite over a small kitchen and two bedrooms in the other half. The boys and girls restrooms were converted to half baths, and the original wood flooring was sanded and stained.</p>
                            <p>The exterior was fully restored, including bell tower and stone foundations. A deck and swimming pool were added to the outdoor "playground," a modern contrast to the original merry-go-round and chin-up bars.</p>

                            <p>Design, construction drawings and supervision for a 48 unit apartment building.</p>
                            <p>Extended Description: Sited in downtown San Francisco, a major issue in the design of this 48 unit apartment complex was the need to create a quiet retreat sheltered from the noisy interference and potential dangers of urban life. An image of medieval cities with their protective walls was evoked in Willis' mind. At Nob Hill Court, the medieval wall becomes inhabitable space with a fortress-like facade. The building turns away from the threatening presence of the street to focus on a peaceful open air courtyard interior to the site. A two-story entry lobby with sweeping circular stair is carved from the parking garage that forms the base of the building and the private court.</p>
                            <p>Willis transforms the issue of security into a sense of permanency by maximizing the plan and volume of the primary living space of each unit. Large windows flood the interior spaces with light; door and ceiling moldings provide rich details that offer a textural contrast with the plaster walls. Fireplaces, a traditional symbol of home, contribute to the ambiance of warmth and serenity.</p>
                            <p>The facade of the building, reminiscent of a stone outcropping, is softened by the use of wood shingles. The mullioned patterns of the wood windows further reduce the scale, offering a degree of detail found in single-family homes.</p>

                            <p>Design and construction drawings for the Internal Revenue Service. Expandable prototypical computer center building to be adapted and built on nine campuses. Unbuilt.</p>
                            <p>Extended Description: Designed by Willis in 1976 for the General Services Administration and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the project entailed the development of a prototypical computing center planned for construction on 9 regional complexes scattered throughout the United States. A totally flexible building, the hexagonal shape adapted easily to differing sites, the angular sides meshing with building configurations like a pinion and a wheel.</p>
                            <p>Capable of accommodating 1 to 4 levels, Willis' design incorporated energy conservation techniques, task and user-friendly lighting and work stations, and flexible distribution systems researched and developed as a portion of the design scope. The open-air courtyard at the center of the building increased the amount of natural light and air available to the occupants and provided a natural compliment to the technologically-driven building.</p>

                            <p>Project scope included design, construction drawings and supervision for a free standing building for small children. Building part of a large park with many different facilities.</p>
                            <p>Extended Description: The Children's recreational Center at the Margaret Hayward Playground Park was designed and executed in 1982. Located in a modest-income neighborhood in San Francisco, California, the layer facade -- reminiscent of the segmented shell of an armadillo -- unfolds from the corner of the constrained site toward the outdoor play equipment.</p>
                            <p>Willis designed the layers to act as theatrical backdrops, in an effort to encourage the children's imaginary performances and to allow for scalar shifts that accommodate both child and adult. A series of wide steps linking the playground and building entry create an impromptu thrust stage and child-sized seating area.</p>
                            <p>Approximately 1,200 square feet of internal area accommodates the main recreational playroom, administrative offices and various support services.</p>

                            <p>Master plan for a new town of 100,000 people.</p>
                            <p>Extended Description: By 1986, Green Valley -- an 8,400 acre planned community in the Nevada desert that would eventually house 100,000 residents -- had undergone sufficient development to support a small town- like commercial center. A 75 acre site adjacent to the Green Valley parkway was proposed for the Center. Willis executed a conceptual master plan for the site to accommodate phased development as future growth occurred. To provide a sense of community, Willis' plan proposed a full complement of retail, commercial, multi-family residential, entertainment, and recreational facilities.</p>
                            <p>Given the physical discomfort entailed by the hot, arid climate, Willis incorporated environmental design strategies to minimize the unpleasant effects. Pedestrian arcades, towers with wind-catchers, moisturizing sprays, and landscaped "greenwalls" all served to reduce the effective daily temperature. As a focal point, Willis created a village green that fronted a four-plex cinema, an ice skating rink, and a variety of cafes and restaurants, providing a casual spill-over space for leisure activities.</p>

                            <p>Extended Description: Covering 24 acres--four city blocks--in downtown San Francisco, the Yerba Buena site was seen as a bridge that could extend the economic success of the financial and Union Street districts into the surrounding urban neighborhood ravaged by poorly conceived urban renewal projects. In 1980, the master plan put forth by the team of Beverly Willis Architects, Olympia &amp; York, Ltd., the Marriott Corporation, and Zeidler-Roberts Partnership, Ltd. won an international competition for the site's development.</p>
                            <p>Consisting of 1,250,000 square feet of office space, a 1,500-room hotel, 250,000 square feet of retail, 350 apartments, and an exhibition and performance art complex, the master plan created transitions in scale, use, texture, access that seamlessly rewove the urban fabric into an integrated whole. Ground level components were reduced in size creating a comfortable pedestrian street-scape that negated the presence of the 'super block' towers. A series of open spaces, sited for maximum sunlight and minimal wind, further reduced the scale and offered a variety of outdoor environments.</p>

                            <p>Project entailed building design, construction drawings and construction supervision for a new 4 story, 96 foot-high building in San Francisco's Civic Center.</p>
                            <p>Extended Description: In the design of the building for the San Francisco Ballet Association, Willis was preoccupied with how the design could reflect the total fabric of a dancer's life. Located in the city's Civic Center, the site for the modest project of some 65,000 feet was surrounded by such monumentally-scaled buildings as the Opera House, Symphony Hall, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and City Hall.</p>
                            <p>To be compatible with the Civic Center's Neoclassical context, Willis used a tripartite horizontal ordering system derived from Renaissance principles on the facade. Breaking with classical tradition of symmetry, the entry was located on the corner, the curvilinear wall suggesting physical movement and offering a unique identity for the growing ballet company.</p>
                            <p>As the dancers were required to spend six hours per day in the facility, the desire for natural light and outdoor air is reflected in the interior. In the large airy spaces visually accessible to the outdoors, Willis developed a mirror system to provide unbroken images of lifts and jumps, as well as a fluorescent lighting system free of the stroboscopic wavering that causes dizziness during practice. The building includes rehearsal, instructional, and administrative spaces along with food service, locker rooms, and lounges.</p>

                            <p>Extended Description: Behind the form of the winery, the aging sheds and the terrace lie images of the traditions common to wine-making throughout the centuries. Willis transforms these historical images into crisp contemporary form through the use of geometry and the incorporation of natural materials that respond to the agrarian</p>
                            <p>In the main building of the winery, the facade of vertical grain redwoods are fitted together like the staves of an oak cask, held rigidly in place by two large steel bands encircling the building under a tern metal roof. The golden mean proportion that governs the scale and relationships of the design encompasses a cylindrical cupola at the winery roof. The warm air of the California day is drawn upward, escaping through the cupola's perimeter vents.</p>
                            <p>To maintain the constant temperature required in the aging process, Willis designed the areas as "caves", determining through computer analysis the appropriate thermal mass for passive cooling. Supported by a timed intake fan rather than air conditioning, strict temperature criteria are met with reduced energy consumption.</p>

                            <p>Extended Description: In designing a pool house to be located on an old campsite of the Wappa Indians, Willis responded to the owners' desire to preserve a rumored burial mound by reinventing a bit of history. Nomadic gatherers and hunters, the Wappa tribe had left little evidence of their cultural traditions or imagery. Through the use of universal mythical images -- such as the sun, eagle and sky boat -- Willis recreated the spiritual journey of the ancient tribe in stucco bias relief on the pool-house facade and through the design of a memorial sun marker.</p>
                            <p>Located beside an existing swimming pool, the pool house was designed to accommodate casual pool-side entertaining as well as the functional necessities of showering and dressing, Willis used the golden section to generate all parts of the building form, modulating the two squares of the floor plan with a trace of the roof to derive three distinct spaces. In the vaulted center section, sliding doors are pocketed into the walls, dissolving the boundaries between pool and house.</p>

                            <p>Extended Description: The focus of the River Run property consisted of two small knolls nestled side-by-side overlooking the flat valley land and the Napa River. Entered by way of a nineteenth century stone bridge, a working vineyard of Chardonnay grapes surrounds the knolls, the first of which houses the remodeled estate gate house. In the field between the knolls were two barns, one of which Willis remodeled as a stable with full tack room and grooming area.</p>
                            <p>The farmhouse, imbued with the image of a Palladian villa, monumentally commands the second knoll along with a renovated guest house and pool. The grand semicircular staircase and the symmetrical facade contrast with the asymmetrical elements of the natural landscaping. The form of the portico recalls the colonnades of early Tuscany, their redwood material exuding a warmth not found in the stone and masonry of their historic counterparts.</p>
                            <p>The interior of the house is comprised of four "living centers" -- the public reception and entertainment area, the food preparation and relaxation area, the more private library and study area, and the fully private sleeping and bath areas. Sharing fireplace with the master bedroom, the master bath has a view of the pool that links the guest and main houses.</p>

                    <p>This series spans the period 1972-1978 and documents the development of CARLA, Computerized Approach to Residential Land Analysis, by Beverly Willis, Eric Tiescholz, and Jochen Eigen. The system enabled architects to use computers to develop site plan design techniques more efficiently. It contains computer paper drive tapes of software program versions, a computer-punched paper drive of CARLA original film, flowcharts, videotapes, rough material for CARLA videotape, articles about computer-assisted analysis and mapping systems, computer manuals, and memos. Also included are Jochen Eigen's 1974 notes on interfacing CARLA with a computer mapping program.</p>
