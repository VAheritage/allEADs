      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Samuel P. Hite was born in Augusta County, Virginia in 1843. In 1862, he enlisted as a
        private in Company D, 5th Virginia Infantry. Hite was wounded in the battles of Malvern Hill
        and Chancellorsville; on February 6, 1864, he was captured at Morton's Ford. Six weeks
        later, upon taking the oath of allegiance, Hite was sent to New York. </p>
      <p>By 1871, Hite was manufacturing patent medicines on Moffatt's Creek (Augusta County),
        Virginia. His business a success, Hite in 1887 moved his laboratory to nearby Staunton,
        where he and his workers manufactured a number of products, with Hite's Pain Cure apparently
        being the most successful of these. </p>
      <p>As Hite's business continued to expand, it was incorporated as the S. P. Hite Company in
        1905, with $100,000 in stocks sold to several Roanoke investors. Hite was retained as
        president and remained in Staunton, but the company's headquarters relocated to Roanoke.
        Hite himself remained in Staunton, however. Hite died in Radford on March 10, 1917.
        Unmarried, he bequeathed the bulk of his estate to the Children's Home in Richmond. </p>
