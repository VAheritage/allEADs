            <head>Biographical Information</head>
            <p>William H. Yeaman was a private in Company A led by Captain David Townes, 38th
                Virginia Infantry led by Colonel Isaac Carrington of Pittsylvania Court House,
                Armistead's Brigade, Pickett's Division, Army of Northern Virginia. Wounded at Seven
                Pines and died at Gettysburg in 1863. </p>
            <p>His brother was Thomas B. Yeaman of Ringgold, Pittsylvania County, Virginia; his
                father was John Yeaman of the same town.</p>
            <p>See page 43-52 of <title render="italic">War Recollections of the Confederate
                    Veterans of Pittsylvania County, Virginia, 1861-1865</title> in Special
                Collections for an account of the experience of Yeaman's peers during the battle in
                which he died.</p>

        <scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a">
            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>A majority of the letters are accompanied by the original envelope. Letters contain
                battle description and depictions of soldier life. </p>
            <p>May 30, 1863: Thanks his brother for sending him a fish hook for both practicality
                and to pass the boredom of camp life.</p>
            <p>Yeaman mentions "Cousin Jim" several times in letters, who is apparently in camp with
                him. </p>
            <p>The collection also includes four photographs: One of Pearl Yeaman. Two of T.B.
                Yeaman [likely the brother] of Keysville, VA, with one "after he shaved off long
                beard" and one "before he cut his beard." One of E.T Yeaman "before he married." The
                pictures are not dated.</p>
