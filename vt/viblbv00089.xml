      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Rachel Louisa Sutton, daughter of John and Eliza Glasgow
         Sutton, was born in Pulaski County, Virginia, in 1849. During
         the late 1860s, she attended nearby Martha Washington College.
         On December 14, 1870, she married Pulaski County farmer David
         H. Martin (born c.1849). The couple had 10 or 11 children,
         including Walter B. (VPI class of 1909) and Lilly, born
         probably in 1871, who attended Hollins Institute (now Hollins
         University) in the early 1890s. Lilly later married James
         Porterfield Mason, and they became the parents of six
         children, including Elinor.</p>
      <p>Elinor Mason, daughter of James P. and Lilly Martin Mason,
         was born, probably in Pulaski County, in 1910. During the
         1940s, she was a federal employee, living in Williamsburg,
         Virginia. She later retired to Glade Spring, Virginia, where
         she died in 1996.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers of the Sutton-Martin-Mason family consist
         largely of the personal correspondence of Rachel Louisa Sutton
         (familiarly known as Louisa or Lou), the greater majority of
         the letters being from family and friends in the years before
         she was married. The letters mostly comment upon personal and
         family matters but many also relate to the Civil
         War--including comments on military campaigns, conditions on
         the homefront, and news of local men serving in the war. A
         number of letters are written from Martha Washington College
         (Abingdon, Virginia) and discuss the school, its classes, and
         related activities. A few of the letters appear to be draft
         copies of letters written by Sutton to her friends but never
         mailed.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains other papers of David and
         Louisa Martin, such as deeds, assorted financial records
         (including personal checks, account statements, receipts, and
         a notice for the sale of the John Sutton estate), poetry (most
         of which seems to have been copied from published sources,
         rather than being original compositions), and general
         materials (including grade reports for the Martins' children
         from various Southwest Virginia educational institutions) and
         assorted ephemera (including a dress pattern fragment cut from
         a Civil War-era newspaper); and photographs.</p>
      <p>The papers of Elinor Mason, comprising one folder, include
         correspondence, photographs, postcards and assorted
         ephemera.</p>
