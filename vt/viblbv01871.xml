      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Designed and built at the turn of the 20th century by Charles T. Crocker, who envisioned it
        as the cornerstone of a plan to make San Francisco "the Paris of the West," the St. Francis
        Hotel established itself as a city landmark. The original building was completed in 1904,
        but its popularity led to plans for rapid expansion. When the 1906 earthquake struck San
        Francisco, the hotel sustained only minimal damage and none of it was structural. Over the
        next three days, however, fires inside the building did cosmetic destruction to elements of
        the hotel. Reconstruction and repairs started quickly and the hotel re-opened in 1907 with a
        new wing was added in 1908. Later renovations and additions were competed in the late
        1960s/early 1970s. Since its early days, the hotel has hosted celebrities, politicians, and
        dignaries.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection contains a scrapbook of images from the liquor store window at the St.
        Francis Hotel in San Francisco, California. The collection likely dates from about the
        1950s, though none of the items are specifically dated. The scrapbook primarily consists of
        original photographs, mostly black and white 8x10s. They depict changing seasonal and
        product-based displays from the storefront. In addition, there are some smaller black and
        white and color photographs. The scrapbook also contains several pieces of ephemera:
        advertisements for products, newspaper ads, and resources on San Francisco (maps, tourist
        guides, and flyers). Oversize materials include hand-painted art and advertisements for the
        liquor store. Materials were collected by then-store-owner Philip B. Anson.</p>

      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>During processing, the contents of the pages were removed from the scrapbook and housed in
        an acid-free binder-box. Four oversized pages were removed to a large folder and their
        location is noted in the box, but otherwise the collection is in its original order.</p>
