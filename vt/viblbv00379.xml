<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Tennessee, Alabama &amp; Georgia Railway was created in 1911 as a reorganization of the failed Chattanooga Southern Railway. Placed in receivership in 1922, the line was purchased and its name changed to the Tennessee, Alabama &amp; Georgia Railway. The 92-mile line spanned from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Gadsden, Alabama and was purchased by the Southern Railway in 1971; a northern portion of the line today (2009) is leased from Norfolk Southern and operated by the Chattooga and Chickamauga Railway.
