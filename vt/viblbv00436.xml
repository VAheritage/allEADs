<head>Historical Information</head>
<p>The state of Virginia acquired the Natural Tunnel and about 100 acres of surrounding area from the Natural Tunnel Chasm and Caverns Corporation, in hopes of establishing a state park, in 1967. After the purchase of another 850 acres in 1971, the Natural Tunnel State Park was opened. This attraction, located in Scott County, Virginia, has drawn sightseers and adventurers for over 100 years. The park now offers various services for visitors, including hiking, swimming, and camping. A visitor's center and amphitheatre have also been built on the park grounds.</p></bioghist>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Wooden postcards were somewhat of a novelty in the 20<emph render="super">th</emph> century. While many wooden cards date back to the early-1900s, the most probable time period for this particular wooden postcard is c.1932-1958. During this time, wooden postcards could be sent with a single $0.03 first-class postage stamp as this particular postcard was. The postcard was produced by Dixie Novelty Company of Asheville, North Carolina.  The note to Mrs. Chaz Etter of Rural Retreat, Virginia, thanks her and advises her to visit the tunnel. </p> 
<p>The photocopy of a sketch of Natural Tunnel comes from the following book: Bryant, William Cullen, and Oliver Bell Bunce. <title render="italic">Picturesque America, or, The Land We Live in: A Delineation by Pen and Pencil of the Mountains, Rivers, Lakes, Forests, Water-Falls, Shores, Canyons, Valleys, Cities, and Other Picturesque Features of Our Country.</title> New York: D. Appleton and Co, 1872. While the date of the photocopy is uncertain, the original sketch dates to 1872.</p></scopecontent>
