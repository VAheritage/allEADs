<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>In 1906, the American Gas and Electric Company was formed from Electric Company of America&ndash;a utility holding company&ndash;and soon began offering electric, water, transit, steam, gas, and ice services to individuals living in New Jersey, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia, Indiana, and Ohio. In 1925, AG&amp;E purchased the Appalachian Power Company and merged their other holdings in Virginia and southern West Virginia with the new company. The newly merged units were soon renamed the Appalachian Electric Power Company In 1958, AG&amp;E became American Electric Power (A.E.P.).</p><p>Today, the Appalachian Electric Power Company's headquarters are in Charleston, West Virginia. A.E.P serves about one million customers in Virginia, Tennessee, and West Virginia, accounting for about &frac14; of American Electric Power's total customers. </p>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The American Gas and Electric Company purchased the Appalachian Power Company in 1925, merging units in middle-Appalachia in order to create the Appalachian Electric Power Company. The photograph in this collection of A.E.P. Company's First Aid Class is taken shortly after the merger, in 1931. It is unclear whether the photograph pictures employees, volunteers, or other important contributors to the company's success. The Service Pin Dinner photograph was also taken during a period of transition for the company, preceding the renaming of A.E.P.'s parent company&ndash;American Gas and Electric Company.  Additionally, the Service Pin Dinner and First Aid Class photographs have ordered lists on the back of each photograph of the individuals pictured.
