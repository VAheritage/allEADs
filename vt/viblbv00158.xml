      <head>Biographical/Historical Information </head>
      <p>The Funeral Consumers Alliance of the Virginia Blue Ridge began in January 2001 with
                six members of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation in Blacksburg, Virginia. The
                organization made a conscious effort to branch out and not be associated with any
                denomination. The group is committed to providing information about end-of-life
                planning to anyone who requests it. The FCAVBR is a volunteer group. It is committed
                to fostering a cooperative working relationship with the community, including
                businesses dealing with end-of-live. </p>

                wishing to make their own choices related to death, funerals, and final plans.
                Materials have been prepared by the FCAVBR, which is concerned with helping
                individuals do their own end-of-life planning. It includes a Checklist for Survivors
                as well as "A Guide for My Survivors." The collection also contains a packet which

                includes survey results for 2003 and 2004 FCAVBR surveys relating to costs for
                services of over 30 cemeteries and 27 funeral homes in the Virginia Blue Ridge area.
                The collection also contains over 30 brochures dealing with various topics
                associated with death and dying and funeral plans, such as "How to Plan a Memorial
                Service, "A Guide to Funeral Planning," "Organ &amp; Body Donation," Viewing and
                Visitation," and "What You Should Know About Embalming. The brochures endeavor to
