            <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
            <p>William Gideon Harris, from Alexandria, Virginia, was a member of the 1911 Class at
                VPI &amp; SU. He graduated with a degree in Applied Chemistry. He was a member of
                the football team (1907-1908), baseball team (1908-1909), and a member of the social
                club the "Fallen Angels."</p>
            <p>The "Fallen Angels," a Pandamonium Club, was a social club created by the senior
                cadets who had lost their rank. They were around from 1907-1923. When formed, their
                favorite activity was listed as "Hunting trouble." Little is known beyond that about
                the club, but there seems to be some connection to Milton.</p>
            <p>The 1905 Chapel has several appearances within the album, though little is recorded
                about it. It was located on the hill where McBryde Hall is now. It was taken down in
                1914, replaced by the first McBryde Hall in 1914. It was a limestone church, with a
                Victorian gothic design. There was also a crenelated tower attached to the
                church.</p>
            <p>The Snowball Fight is a Virginia Tech tradition. On the first big snow of the season,
                the Corps of Cadets goes out on the drill field and battle it out. This has
                transformed over the years from being an activity with just the Corps to one setting
                the Virginia Tech civilians against the Corps of Cadets.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>William Gideon Harris album contains photographs and several pieces of ephemera. The
                images include those depicting student life and campus, sporting events, images of
                girls (some even dressed in the cadet uniforms) as well as outings in the local
                area, such as Cascades, a mine, and a mill. There is some newspaper clippings and
                poetry on some of the pages, and a sentimental love poem with bows and hair
                attached. The images date from approximately 1908 to 1912. There are also some
                experiments with film development.</p>

        <arrangement id="ref9" encodinganalog="351">
            <head>Arrangement</head>
            <p>The photographs are believed to be in chronological order within the album/scrapbook.
                There are markers which delineate the years in which the images were taken.</p>
