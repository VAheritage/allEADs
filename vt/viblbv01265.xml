          <p>Melville Nickerson, of the 2nd Maine Infantry, wrote a long letter to his sister on
            September 21, 1861. He starts off the letter saying it will be a long letter, and then
            on September 24th he adds that he had not had a chance to write again because he was on
            duty and the rest of the letter is added on then. He has been working on cutting down
            trees so they have better range with their guns. The letter is written with an old
            fashioned quill pen. He describes some of the other letters he has received. He also
            talks about his travel through Boston. Transcript included.</p>

            War, he worked as a bookkeeper. Way enlisted with Company G, 1st New Jersey Volunteer
            Infantry as a captain in 1861. In 1863, he transferred to Company S and was promoted to
            major. He was wounded at Wilderness in 1864, and between that and his service at Gaines
            Farm in 1863, he was brevetted lieutenant colonel in 1865. Following the war, he worked
            in real estate and insurance. Way died in 1890 and is buried in New Brunswick, New

          <p>This letter is written by Jonathan [Unknown] to Sallie and was written on August 26,
            1861. He starts off saying that he knows she complains he doesn't write often but he
            writes as often as he could. She wants to visit him, but he says as happy as that would
            make him there is no where for them to stay. He talks about the clothing she sent him.
            He says the health of his regiment is not good and several have died of pneumonia. He
            says that he thinks they will advance on Washington soon. He tells her to give his love
            to several people. Transcript included.</p>
