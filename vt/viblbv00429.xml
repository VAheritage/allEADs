<head>Biographical Information</head><p>
While no information could be found on this particular stamp kit or the identity of &quot;I.C.F.,&quot; the case, labeled &quot;Moore Brothers&quot; with the address &quot;521 State Street, Bristol Va.-Tenn.&quot; suggests that this item was purchased between 1854 and 1863. During this period, John H. Moore of Russell County, Virginia, had purchased a lot of land on the southwest corner of present-day State and Lee Streets in Bristol, Virginia, making him the first merchant in the city. This corner lot would have encompassed 521 State Street.</p><p>
John H. Moore's store proved quite lucrative; however, he returned to Russell County, Virginia, and sold his store to his cousin, A.K. Moore, in 1856. A.K. Moore owned the store until his murder in 1863. E.H. Seneker then purchased the building to establish his own merchantile store, removing the Moore name. </p><p>
