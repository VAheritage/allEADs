         <p>The Norfolk and Western Railway Archive and the Southern Railroad Archive are two large
            collections reflecting the development of railroad transportation from the 19th to the
            21st century. The Norfolk and Western Railway began operation in Petersburg, Virginia
            with a nine-mile line in 1838, and it eventually merged with over 200 railroad companies
            to encompass more than 7,000 miles of road. The Southern Railroad Company was organized
            in 1894 from the bankrupt Richmond and Danville Railroad and several other railroad
            companies. The Southern Railroad eventually became the product of nearly 150 predecessor
            lines that were combined, reorganized, and recombined since the 1830s. In 1982 the
            Norfolk and Western Railway combined with the Southern Railroad creating the Norfolk
            Southern Railway. In total, the collection is comprised of over 350 smaller railroad
            companies.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The Norfolk and Western (later to become the Norfolk Southern Railway) collection
            documents the development of railroad transportation from the 19th to the 21st century.
            The Norfolk and Western Railway merged with the Southern Railroad to become the Norfolk
            Southern Railway. The collection primarily documents the over 200 railroad companies
            that merged over almost a century to become the Norfolk Western. These records are
            organized in two series: Railway Records and Public Relations Photograph Series. The
            Railway Records, forming the bulk of the collection, are comprised of individual company
            records such as stockholders' and directors' minutes, stock certificates, finance
            dockets, reports and statistics, etc. Also included are pre-Civil War accounting records
            of the predecessor companies, Presidential papers of Samuel Spencer and several Southern
            Railroad vice- presidents, Law Department letter books, ledgers, and railroad
            publications. In addition, the record files include individual personnel records from
            the Norfolk and Western and a large collection of maps consisting of railroad route maps
            and bridge drawings from various railroad companies.</p>
         <p>The Public Relations Photograph Series contains approximately 30,000 photographs from
            the Public Relations Department of the Norfolk and Western Railway. Included in the
            photographs are images of locomotives, coal mines, group and individual employee
            portraits, train wrecks, cities and towns, images from Hotel Roanoke, etc. Many of the
            railroad images housed at Virginia Tech are also online at the <extref
