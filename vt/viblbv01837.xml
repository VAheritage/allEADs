      <head>Biographical Note: Sherwood Anderson (1876-1941)</head>
      <p>Sherwood Anderson (1876-1941) was born in the small town of Camden, Ohio, to a large and
        impoverished family. An outstanding student, Anderson quit school at 14 to help support his
        family. In 1895 he volunteered for the Spanish-American War, then spent one year in
        Wittenburg College. He worked as a laborer in Chicago and later as a writer in an
        advertising agency. Unable to resist the urge to write and live a bohemian lifestyle,
        Anderson suffered an emotional breakdown and walked away from his family and his mail-order
        paint business. He had three children (two sons and a daughter) from his first marriage.
        Anderson eventually married three more times. Anderson published 27 books, plays, and
        volumes of short stories, along with numerous articles in periodicals. Often controversial,
        he wrote about issues as diverse as the sexual awakening of adolescence to the alienation
        caused by industrialization. He was very active in the intellectual community of the day and
        was instrumental in helping both Faulkner and Hemingway to be published for the first time.
        Anderson wrote to his daughter from Kansas City in March, 1933, "As you know, my dear, I
        never did domesticate well," but he always maintained relationships with his children. Later
        in life, Anderson embarked on his fourth marriage to Eleanor Copenhaver, a native of Marion,
        Virginia. They traveled extensively and spent summers on their rural farm, "Ripshin," near
        Marion. Anderson bought and operated both of Marion's local newspapers and eventually passed
        ownership along to his eldest son, Robert. Sherwood Anderson died on the first leg of a
        long-anticipated trip to South America. He developed peritonitis and was hospitalized in
        Panama, where he passed away on March 8, 1941.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note: Eleanor Copenhaver Anderson (1896-1985)</head>
      <p>Eleanor Gladys Copenhaver (1896-1985) was born on June 15, 1896 in Marion, Virginia, to
        Bascom Eugene and Laura Lu Scherer Copenhaver. Laura Lu's father founded Marion Female
        College, which was located next door to the family home, "Rosemont." Laura Lu attended
        Marion College and later taught English there. Her husband, B.E. Copenhaver, first taught at
        Marion and then became Smyth County superintendent of schools. Eleanor Copenhaver attended
        Marion College, then Westhampton College in Richmond, completing a B. A. in English in 1917.
        After spending a year teaching and time as a camp director, she spent more than ten years
        working for the YWCA, specializing first in rural community organizing and later in
        industrial communities. During this time, she met and eventually married Sherwood Anderson
        in 1933. </p>
      <p>From 1937 to 1947 Copenhaver Anderson was head of the National YWCA's Industrial Program,
        later accepting a 2 year assignment abroad. In 1950, she spent a brief time apart from the
        YWCA, after it ended programs for employed women, but she was re-hired in 1951 for another
        ten years for the YWCA and United Community Defense Services, until she retired in 1961. </p>
      <p>She spent her later life in both New York City and at “Rosemont" and “Ripshin" in Virginia.
        As the collection suggests, she maintained an active role in scholarship surrounded Sherwood
        Anderson. She died on September 12, 1985, in Marion, Virginia. </p>

      <head>Biographical Note: J. J. Lankes (1884-1960)</head>
      <p>Julius John (J. J.) Lankes was born in 1884 in Buffalo, NY. He began working as a draftsman
        in 1902, but spent the majority of his professional life known for his woodcuts. His career
        as an artist spanned decades, during which he created woodcuts and illustrations for
        authors, among others. In addition to Sherwood Anderson, he worked with Robert Frost and
        Beatrix Potter. Lankes wrote and illustrated <title render="italic">A Woodcut
        Manual</title>, published by Henry Holt in 1932. In 2006, The University of Tampa published
        a new edition of this book with selected letters and other writings, edited by Welford
        Dunaway Taylor. (A copy of the 2006 edition is housed in Special Collections. A copy of the
        1932 edition is available at the University Libraries' Art &amp; Architecture Library.) In
        addition to his illustrations and work as an artist, Lankes taught at Wells College from
        1933 to about 1940. From 1943 to 1950, Lankes worked for the reproduction section of the
        National Advisory Council for Aeronautics (NACA, later NASA). He retired in 1951 and died in
        April 1960.</p>

              <p>This audio reel contains no lead and starts in the middle of an interview with an
                unknown person about his memories and experiences with Sherwood Anderson. Following
                the interview, which is cut short, the audio is unplayable by equipment in Special
                Collections (it seems to have been recorded at a different speed) for many minutes.
                The middle of the reel includes recordings of someone playing piano. The end of the
                reel contains additional audio again apparently recorded at a different speed and
                unplayable.</p>
