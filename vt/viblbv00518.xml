      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Landon Duncan was born in Faquier County, Virginia, on March 26, 1786. He moved to
                Stokes County, North Carolina, presumably to live with his uncle Alamander Duncan.
                At an undetermined date he moved to Giles County, Virginia, and lived there, in the
                Wolf Creek section, for the remainder of his life. He married Sarah Kirk on August
                12, 1812; they had nine children.</p>
      <p>Duncan was a Baptist minister and established several churches in the county. He also
                served as a teacher in Pearisburg and was a Commissioner of the Revenue. He died on
                September 22, 1867.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection consists of six letters. Two of the letters (1812, 1814) were written
                by Landon Duncan to his uncle Alamander Duncan in Stokes County, North Carolina.
                Three of the letters (1837, n.d.) were written to his cousin Hiram Duncan of the
                same county. One letter (1836) was written by Jane H. Threves in Gallatin,
                Tennessee, to her cousin Hiram Duncan.</p>
      <p>Many of the letters are addressed to the North Carolina Duncan family in Blakely,
                Stokes County, but a recent check (March 1998) of a North Carolina map shows that
                this town no longer exists.</p>
      <p>Landon Duncan's religious convictions are evident in all of the letters he writes to
                his North Carolina relatives. In several of the letters he expounds at length about
                the nature of God's grace and his faith. Duncan also writes frequently about the
                current prices of basic goods such as pork and corn, and occasionally about his
                neighbors. In his letter of December 16, 1814, he gives his opinion of the draft
                laws passed in the Virginia legislature for War of 1812.</p>
