      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Los Angeles Modern Bartending School Collection includes two bartending guides for
        students from the 1930s. </p>
      <p>The "277 Standard/100 Tropical Recipes" is a 1944 revised edition and includes cocktail
        recipes in two sections. This edition built on the first version, copyright in 1937. Pages
        are carbon type copies of recipes, arranged in alphabetical order within each section. Taped
        to the front and back covers are instructions on wine service. One page also has a cut out
        recipe and picture for a "Moscow Mule." This item is almost entirely a recipe book, with the
        exception of one preliminary page of hints.</p>
      <p>The untitled "[Bartender's Guide]" is likely from the 1930s, around 1935 and is presumed to
        be the first edition. It contains information on wines &amp; wine service, bar preparation
        and maintenance, spirits, and cocktail recipes. This is an all-around guide that includes
        introductory comments by the author, Joseph V. Jordan; extensive comments on what a barman
        is and should know; and hints and guidelines for proper behavior, including tips like: <list>
          <item>3. Be as clean as a daily bath will make you.</item>
          <item>17. Do not get pally with customers. (They will expect drinks on the house.)</item>
          <item>20. If a telephone call comes for a customer, never admit over the phone that the
            customer is at your bar, until you find out if he wants it known.</item>
        </list></p>
      <p>The guide features pages on measurements, specific spirits, glassware, terms, and
        appetizer/tonic/medicinal drinks, as well as an overview of waters, beer, and many pages on
        wine. The remaining one-fourth of the guide is a series of 25 "lessons," each of which is a
        series of cocktail recipes. Most early lessons are collections of classic recipes; other
        later lessons are build around themes like tropical drinks or variations on the daiquiri. </p>
      <p>Neither item was formally published, suggesting they were created for and used as primarily
        as a teaching tool and for use by students who transitioned to amateur or professional
        bartending. Given the 1930s dates on both of these items, they are of particular
        significance in light of their "tropical" recipes. Tiki and tropical drink cocktail culture
        was just beginning to gain attention in the United States during the 1930s (it would become
        increasingly popular following World War II), thanks bartenders like Don the Beachcomber and
        Trader Vic. The fact that these guides include tropical drinks suggests the Los Angeles
        Bartending School was looking to leverage this newness. The last lesson of the "[Bartender's
        Guide]" ends with "Your attention is called to the fact that very few Bartenders in Los
        Angeles know these Tropical Drinks[.] If you let some one copy these drinks from you book
        you are just creating unnecessary competition to yourself in this new field[.] USE COMMON
        SENSE[.]"</p>
