            <p>The Sheet Music Collection contains various songs (lyrics and music) from about 1823 through the mid-20th century. Music in the collection is predominantly from American popular culture, but there are also some pieces from Europe, a well as theater souvenir programs and song-books. The folder list below includes a list of song titles and, when known, composers and lyricists, for each box in the collection.</p>

        <arrangement id="ref19">
            <head>Arrangement</head>
            <p>Sheet music in the collection is in the order in which it was received. For the most part, it is organized alphabetically by the composers last name. Songs for which the composer is not known are in the last two boxes (7 and 8).</p>
