            <p>The entries in this ledger suggest that it was maintained by a firm operating under the name Miralla &amp; Co., and later, Miralla, Knight &amp; Co. An advertisement appearing in the 
                <title render="italic">Boston Daily Advertiser</title> of February 14, 1817, reads in part: "Havana.--Samael Curson [Samuel Carson?] and George Knight, inform their friends and the public, that they have formed a Copartnership in trade, under the firm of Miralla &amp; Co. for the purpose of transacting American Commission Business in Havana." No further record or mention of the firm could be found.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection consists of a single ledger maintained by an unidentified shipping merchant operating in Havana, Cuba during the early 19th century. Included are descriptions of transactions, with name of ship and shipmaster, goods shipped, destination, and date. The shipments were overwhelmingly bound for merchants in Boston, Massachusetts, and consisted largely of coffee and cigars ("segars") but also included candles, cod, lard, sugar and other goods. The ledger entries suggest that the volume belonged to the firm of Miralla &amp; Co., later operating as Miralla, Knight &amp; Co. A later owner used the volume as a recipe book, pasting into it recipes clipped from newspapers. Many of these were later removed, causing damage to the ledger, but several remain.</p>
