            <p>Florence Kenyon Hayden, United States, 1882-1973, was the first woman to study architecture at Ohio State University and the first woman registered architect in Ohio. At the behest of Ohio State's president William Oxley Thompson, who pushed for a women's residence hall on campus, Hayden designed what would become Oxley Hall. At first, however, the Board of Trustees did not hold much hope for Hayden and they insisted on assigning her a male assistant. Contending that she could not reason with him after spending one day together, Hayden promptly locked him out of the room. With the help of only one other draftsperson, she finished the plans in just 27 days. Hayden supervised the construction and, in the end, came in under budget for both cost and time.</p>

            <p>Han Schroeder, Netherlands, 1918-1992. Schroeder's artistic and architectural education began early, when her mother commissioned the architect Gerrit Rietveld to design what is now known as the Rietveld-Schroeder House, completed in 1924. In this house, Rietveld employed the revolutionary concept of movable walls to make the interior flexible, thereby redefining the limits of space. Growing up in this house fueled Hans interest in architecture, and the beginning of her friendship to Rietveld and her devotion to his ideas. In 1936, she entered the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, and graduated in 1940 with the degree of Diplom Architekt. Schroeder opened her own office in 1954. Later, she moved to the United States and taught interior design at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>

            <p>Nobuko Nakahara, Japan, 1929-2008. Nakahara's career started with a visit to a 10-person architectural firm to inquire about a job. She was told that if she could redesign the office space to fit eleven desks she would be hired and, in the end, Nakahara became the firm's eleventh employee. By founding the women's architecture association PODOKO in 1953, which grew to 28 members, Nakahara created a forum for women to discuss design. A decade later in Paris, she cofounded the Congress of the International Union of Women Architects (UIFA) and became its first president.</p>
