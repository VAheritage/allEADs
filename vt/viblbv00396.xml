<p>Company A of the 41st United States Colored Troops was organized at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during the autumn of 1864. Included on the muster roll is this brief history of the company: "The company and regiment left camp near Fort Harrison, Army of the James the night of March 27th to reinforce the Army of the Potomac, we marched to Hatcher's Run then to Petersburg from there followed the line of the South Side Rail Road in pursuit of Lee's Army. The company was not engaged in any action until April 9, 65, and then but slightly." The 41st was assigned to duty at Petersburg from April 11, 1865 until May 25, when it was moved to Edenburg, Texas, for guard and provost duty. The 41st U. S. C. T. mustered out of service at Brownsville, Texas on November 10 and disbanded at Philadelphia on December 14, 1865.
