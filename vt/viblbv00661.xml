      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Hook was a corporal with Company C, 151st Regiment, Ohio Infantry (National Guard),
                fighting for the Union in the Civil War. Hometown of Lima, Ohio, in Allen County.
                His Civil War service was without incident until July 30 when he was arrested and
                ordered to stand trial for disobeying orders, but the matter was apparently
                dismissed August 6. Hook returned home with the rest of his Regiment after their
                service time concluded.</p>
      <p>The 151st Regiment was organized at Camp Dennison, Ohio, mustered in May 18, 1864,
                and immediately departed for Washington, D.C. specifically for 100 days of service.
                Company C was assigned to duty as garrison at Fort Stevens. However, Hook lists
                several other forts where he was stationed, including Fort Sumner, Fort De Russey,
                and Fort Simmons. Regiment was concentrated at Fort Simmons August 17, moved to Camp
                Chase, Ohio, August 23, and mustered out August 27, 1864. Highlights of service
                include the repelling of Early’s attacks on Washington July 11-12 and a visit by
                President Lincoln immediately before the attacks commenced. Only suffered 10
                casualties, all from disease.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a">
      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>Entries primarily detail Hook's movements and actions from the day before mustering
                in Ohio until a few days before his return. Hook notes passing Harpers Ferry and
                encountering wounded soldiers returning home. Most days are described as "pleasant"
                in the fortifications around Washington, D.C. throughout the first half of Hook's
                deployment. Lincoln arrived in camp on July 10. His subsequent addresses show he
                knew Confederate Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early's forces would be arriving within a day and
                proceeded to stay in camp to observe the fighting, now referred to as the Battle of
                Fort Stevens. The strong defenses of Fort Stevens minimized the military threat and
                Early withdrew after two days of skirmishing without attempting any serious
                assaults.</p>
      <p>Hook notes the fortifications around Washington returned to quiet by July 14. All
                entries return to describing the days as pleasant until July 30. An apparent
                disagreement over the posting of troops resulted in Hook's arrest and detainment at
                Fort Sumner while awaiting trial for court martial. For unapparent reasons, Hook was
                released August 6. The rest of the journal notes his picket duty, although the dates
                August 10-15 are missing. Diary concludes with Hook in Baltimore August 21 awaiting
                departure to Harrisburg and ultimately to Ohio for the Regiment to be mustered
                out.</p>
      <p>Excerpt from July 11: "Old abe was here to day about 11 o’clock and he looked through
                the glasses and said that they was in 2 hours march of the fort thereabout two
                o’clock they commenced firing on skirmish..."</p>
      <p>Excerpt from July 30: "This pleasant morning I went out on our picket and on my
                reaching the post that I was to relive I put my men on post then was ordered to take
                them and put them on the other post but refused and was put under a rest for
                disobeying orders and stand a trail of cort marshal..."</p>
