      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection consists of nine letters written by Wilson R. Pilkington, 41st Pennsylvania
        Infantry Regiment (12th Reserves), to his mother and sister from various locations in
        Virginia, primarily from camps in northern Virginia. The letters date from 1861-1862. In
        addition, there is one letter is written from John Moss to Pilkington's mother, informing
        her of Wilson's death. Pilkington died of wounds received at the Battle of South Mountain,
        September 15, 1862. </p>
      <p>One letter written in June is from around Richmond, Virginia during the Seven Days
        Campaign. The letter dated August 19, 1861 is the only letter to Pilkington's sister. In it
        he mentions a review of the Pennsylvania troops by General George A. McCall. He describes
        his regiment's activities and interactions with Virginia civilians. The letter dated October
        22, 1861, describes movements of the regiment and a reference to the Battle of Ball's Bluff.
        The letter written December 8, 1861, talks about a foraging expedition and lists what he has
        in terms of clothing. In the letter written March 12, 1862, he relates the movements of the
        army towards Centreville, Virginia, and rumor that the Confederates had burned Richmond,
        along with his hopes "that this movement will crush out the Rebellion forever." In May 1862,
        he relates a march towards Fredericksburg in which several men were captured by Confederate
        cavalry. and that he believes "there is something going on; it is whispered that 'Little
        Mac' has taken Richmond..."</p>
