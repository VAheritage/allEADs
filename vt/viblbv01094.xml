            <p>Jacob Wallace Smiley was born in 1833, probably in New York. From 1860, until the time he was drafted in 1863, he lived in Ellery, Chautauqua County, NY. He joined the 7th Company, 1st Battalion, New York Sharpshooters as a private in August of 1863. His unit traveled around Alexandria and other areas of Northern Virginia prior to his death in May 1864.</p>
            <p>Mention of Smiley and documentation of the diary being returned to Smiley's widow, Melisa, by Private Henry Webb of the 50th Virginia Infantry are included in the book 
                <title render="italic">No word of them: First Battalion, New York Sharpshooters, 1862-1865</title> by John E. Bennett (Spec Civil War, Call No. E523.5.112th .B46 2007).</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The collection consists a diary kept by Jacob Wallace Smith, a Union sharpshooter originally from New York. The first few pages of the diary include a brief history of his enlistment. The early entries describe his unit's travels around Alexandria and Northern Virginia. The majority of the entries detail his experiences in and around Culpepper from December 1863 to May 1864. He talks about camp life, drills, daily activities, letters from home, and playing baseball in camp. Smiley's last complete entry was on May 4, 1864, when the regiment moved from Culpepper toward Wilderness. May 5th includes a date and location, but no entry. Smiley was killed in action at the Wilderness later that day.</p>
            <p>Tucked inside the diary is a CDV of Smiley and his wife, Melissa, probably taken before Jacob was drafted.</p>
