<head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
<p>William W. Hurt was born in Virginia around 1879. He married Zula Kinzer, and the couple had two sons: William Whitmore (1905-1984) and Fred Kinzer (1910-2003). The family initially lived in Washington County,
but some years after becoming general manager of the Douglas Land Company, Hurt moved with his family to Marion (Smyth County), where he maintained an active interest in local affairs.
</p>
<p>Many of Hurt's activities centered on his role as manager of the Douglas Land Company and in developing the company's holdings. He supervised the planting and operation of a commercial apple orchard, undertook
game and fish conservation measures and built roads. Hurt was also involved in other business enterprises, many of which were probably connected--either directly or indirectly--with the Douglas Land Company. He
served on the board of directors of the National Bank of Chilhowie and the Colonial Manufacturing Company; was vice-president of the Damascus Telephone Association and the Elk Garden Company and was president of
the Smyth County Fair. Hurt died between 1916 and 1932.
</p>
<p>The Douglas Land Company was organized in New York in 1904 to manage the Douglas family estate of Washington, Smyth and Grayson counties, Virginia. Under the management of William W. Hurt, the company developed
timber, engaged in mineral prospecting and leased to local farmers lands from the estate, known as "Laurel Farm." In 1910, the company sold 28,000 acres of timberland to the United States government as a forest
reserve. Timber from other tracts of land was sold to lumber companies. W. L. Umbarger succeeded Hurt as manager upon the latter's death; Umbarger was later succeeded by H. P. Gills. The company had ceased
operation by 1932.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection contains the business and personal financial papers of William W. Hurt, of Washington and Smyth counties, Virginia. Records of the Douglas Land Company, of which Hurt served as general manager,
comprise the larger part of the collection. These records consist primarily of lease agreements and deeds, as well as other contracts and legal documents.
</p>
<p>The collection also contains records of several other enterprises in which Hurt was involved; at least some of these--such as the Laurel River Farm--were directly connected to the Douglas Land Company. The
collection also contains items relating to the Colonial Manufacturing Company, Damascus Telephone Association, Elk Garden Company, Helton Company, Laurel River Lumber Company, and the Smyth County Fair
Association.
</p>
<p>Of Hurt's personal financial and legal papers, the collection contains several deeds and contracts into which he seems to have entered independent of his position with the Douglas Land Company.
</p>
<p>The collection also contains a folder of documents--mostly receipts and doctor's prescriptions--belonging to J. B. Gilliam, a resident of Smyth County. Gilliam's connection to Hurt or the Douglas Land Company
could not be determined while processing the collection.
</p>
<p>A folder of general materials completes the collection and contains, among other items, various legal documents; 1922-1923 temperature and rainfall statistics for Marion, Virginia; a map showing a Douglas Land
Company tract that was burned in a 1910 fire, and a copy of William Hurt's will.
