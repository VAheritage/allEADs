            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Hallett Swift, son of Ezra and Lucy Swift, was born in Wareham (Plymouth County),
                Massachusetts on September 14, 1802. Swift married Mary Elizabeth Peckham (born
                1810) on February 6, 1832. The couple remained in the Wareham area and had seven
                children (Francis, Henry, Sarah, Lucy, Hallet, Harriet, and David). Various sources
                indicate that Swift was a ship captain. The 1850 census lists Hallet Swift as a
                48-year-old sailor, living in Wareham with 40-year-old wife Mary and four Swift
                children, all born in Massachusetts. The 1860 census lists a 50-year-old Sarah A. B.
                Rothburn operating a boarding house in Wareham. Also within the household are Sarah
                Hattie, and Hallett Swift, presumably her children. No further record could be
                found.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection consists of a single account book, apparently maintained by Hallett
                Swift, of Wareham, Massachusetts. The ledger details sales of produce (consisting
                largely of corn and potatoes) and other goods. Included are the names of buyers,
                dates of purchases, goods purchased and prices paid. The entries also detail credits
                in the form of cash, goods, labor, and services. The ledger also contains an account
                of expenses incurred in traveling to Ohio, apparently to settle affairs of the
                estate of Swift's brother-in-law, Robinson E. Peckham (1807-1839). The latter part
                of the volume has been used as a recipe book, in which are glued more than 200
                recipes, mostly for desserts, clipped from newspapers. Also included are several
                handwritten recipes.</p>
