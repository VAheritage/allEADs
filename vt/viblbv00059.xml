         <p>In 1889, Elizabeth Black of Blacksburg, Virginia, married
         John Apperson of Marion, joining the Black and Kent families
         of Blacksburg with the Apperson family. Elizabeth Black's
         father Harvey Black and John S. Apperson served together in
         the 4th Virginia, 1st Brigade during the Civil War. Black was
         a regimental surgeon and Apperson was a hospital steward under
         his command.</p>
         <p>Harvey Black (1827-1888) was a native of Blacksburg and a
         grandson of town founder John Black. (Harvey Black did not use
         the e in his given name, but as an adult he regularly signed
         his name as H. Black and he was almost always identified
         publicly as Harvey Black.) After attending local schools, he
         began studying medicine under two local doctors. In 1847, he
         volunteered to serve in the Mexican War in the 1st Regiment
         Virginia Volunteers; three months later, he was made a
         hospital steward. He entered medical school at the University
         of Virginia in 1848 and graduated in June 1849. That fall, he
         took a four-month journey, on horseback, from western Virginia
         through the upper Mid-West as far west as Iowa. He decided to
         settle in Blacksburg and opened a medical practice there in
         1852. The same year, he married Mary Kent of Blacksburg.</p>
         <p>On August 2, 1861, Harvey Black was appointed regimental
         surgeon in the 4th Virginia, 1st Brigade, known as the
         Stonewall Brigade. John Apperson, who had enlisted with the
         Smyth Blues of Smyth County, Virginia, in April 1861, was
         appointed hospital steward under the command of Harvey Black
         in March 1862. Black and Apperson served together with the 4th
         regiment until late 1862. They provided medical care to the
         wounded at first Manassas, second Manassas, and the Battle of
         Fredericksburg. In late 1862, Black was appointed surgeon of
         the field hospital of the Second Corps, Army of Northern
         Virginia, and brought Apperson with him. Both served in this
         hospital until the end of the war, taking care of recuperating
         soldiers who were wounded of the Second Corps' major
         engagements, including the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863
         and the Spotsylvania Campaign in 1864. Black assisted Hunter
         Holmes McGuire with the amputation of Stonewall Jackson's arm
         on May 3, 1863.</p>
         <p>After the Civil War, Harvey Black resumed his medical
         practice in Blacksburg. He was elected president of the
         Medical Society of Virginia in 1872. He played an instrumental
         role in the founding of the Virginia Agricultural and
         Mechanical College in Blacksburg in 1872. He was the first
         rector of the Board of Visitors.</p>
         <p>From 1786 to 1882, Harvey Black was Superintendent of the
         Eastern Lunatic Asylum in Williamsburg. In 1884, he was
         appointed to the board of a proposed state mental hospital for
         southwestern Virginia. In 1885, he was elected to represent
         Montgomery County in the House of Delegates and served two
         sessions. In the House, he influenced the decision to locate
         the new hospital in Marion. In 1887, Black became the first
         superintendent of the new Southwestern State Lunatic Asylum in
         Marion. He appointed John S. Apperson assistant physician
         there. Harvey Black died in Richmond in October 1888 and was
         buried in Westview Cemetery in Blacksburg.</p>
         <p>John S. Apperson (1837-1908) was born in Locust Grove,
         Virginia, and moved to Smyth County in 1859. He took a job
         splitting rails and began to study medicine under local
         physician William Faris. In 1861, Apperson enlisted in the
         Smyth Blues, organized as Company D, 4th Virginia. After the
         Civil War, he studied medicine at the University of Virginia,
         earning a degree in 1867. He returned to Smyth County and
         married Victoria Hull in 1868. They lived in Chilhowie, and
         Apperson practiced medicine and farmed. They had seven
         children.</p>
         <p>John Apperson's first wife died in 1887. The same year, he
         took a job as assistant physician under Harvey Black at the
         Southwestern Lunatic Asylum of Virginia in Marion. When Harvey
         Black died in 1888, Apperson resigned his position at the
         Southwestern Lunatic Asylum and established a medical practice
         in Marion. In 1889, he married Elizabeth, daughter of his
         friend and mentor Harvey Black. They had four children:
         Harvey, Alexander, Kent, and Mary.</p>
         <p>After his second marriage, John Apperson pursued a career
         in business. He was one of eight founders of Staley's Creek
         Manganese and Iron Company. In 1906, he expanded the
         operations of the Marion Foundry and Milling Company into the
         Marion Foundry and Machine Works. He also promoted the
         building of the Marion and Rye Valley Railroad.</p>
         <p>In 1892, the Virginia Board of World's Fair Managers
         employed Apperson to collect items and transport Virginia
         exhibits to the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.
         John Apperson died in Marion in 1908. His wife Elizabeth died
         in Blacksburg in 1942.</p>
         <p>Harvey Black Apperson (1890-1948), the oldest child of John
         Apperson and Elizabeth Black, lived in Salem, Virginia, and
         practiced law in Roanoke for thirty years. He became active in
         Democratic Party politics in the 1920s. In a special election
         in 1933, he was elected to represent Floyd, Franklin,
         Montgomery, and Roanoke counties and the cities of Radford and
         Roanoke in the State Senate. He served on the State
         Corporation Commission from 1944 to 1947 and was Chairman of
         the Commission from June 1944 to 1947. Governor William Tuck
         appointed him Attorney General in August 1947, and he took
         office October 7, 1947. He died suddenly of a heart attack at
         his home in Richmond on February 2, 1948. Alexander Apperson
         worked at the Marion Foundry and Machine Works for a period
         and later moved to Birmingham, Alabama.</p>
         <p>Germanicus Kent (1791-1861) and Arabella Amiss Kent
         (1809-1951), parents of Harvey Black's wife Mary, are also
         documented in this collection. Germanicus Kent was born in
         Suffield, Connecticut, and attended Yale College. Circa 1822,
         he moved to Huntsville, Alabama, and worked as a cotton
         merchant. In 1827, he married Arabella Amiss of Blacksburg.
         According to a family account, Germanicus Kent left Huntsville
         in 1834 at the insistence of his brother Aratus Kent, a
         missionary in Illinois who opposed slavery. Aratus Kent was a
         founder of Beloit and Rockford colleges in Illinois. The
         family moved to Illinois in 1834. Lewis Kent (also known as
         Lewis Lemon), a slave who was purchased by Germanicus Kent in
         North Carolina when he was a boy, moved with the family and
         later purchased his freedom and settled in Iowa. Germanicus
         Kent is considered a founder of the town of Rockford,
         Illinois, and served in the Illinois state legislature. Mary
         Kent, born in 1836, was the first child of European ancestry
         born in Rockford. The family returned to Arabella's hometown
         of Blacksburg in 1843.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Papers of the Black, Kent, and Apperson Families of
         Blacksburg and Marion, Virginia, span the years 1779 to 1984,
         with the bulk of the material dating from 1821 to 1948. They
         are comprised of the Civil War letters of Dr. Harvey Black,
         the Civil War diaries of John Apperson, records and
         correspondence pertaining to nineteenth-century Blacksburg
         residents Edwin Amiss, his sister Arabella Amiss Kent, and her
         husband Germanicus Kent, cotton trader and Rockford, Illinois
         pioneer; and account books, correspondence, and photographs of
         several members of the Black, Kent, and Apperson families of
         Blacksburg and Marion, Virginia. The collection is divided
         into the following major series: Harvey Black Papers, Black
         Family Papers, Germanicus Kent Papers, Black Family Business
         Records, John S. Apperson Papers, Mary E. Apperson Papers,
         Alexander Apperson Papers, and Harvey B. Apperson Political
         Scrapbooks.</p>
         <p>Harvey Black Papers: This series spans the years 1847 to
         1888 and is comprised of the following subseries: Diaries,
         Civil War Letters, General Correspondence, Medical Career
         Records, and Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College. It
         also includes one photograph, ca. 1865, of Harvey Black.</p>
         <p>The Civil War Letters span the years 1861 to 1864 and
         document Black's experiences as a regimental surgeon in the
         Stonewall Brigade and as surgeon in charge of the Second Corps
         field hospital. The series is comprised of letters Black wrote
         to his wife Mary (Molly) in Blacksburg. Black usually wrote to
         his wife two to three days after a major battle and reported
         who, from Blacksburg, had been killed or wounded. He describes
         the effects of disease on the troops, looking for his
         brother-in-law Lewis Kent among the Union wounded at the
         Battle of Fredericksburg, the delirium of Stonewall Jackson as
         he lay dying at Guinea Station, and the difficulties of
         keeping his family clothed and fed during the war.</p>
         <p>The Diaries consist of a short diary Black kept of his
         journey from Christiansburg to Mexico to fight in the Mexican
         War and a diary of a four-month journey, on horseback, from
         western Virginia through West Virginia, Ohio, Wisconsin,
         Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, and Tennessee in the fall
         of 1849. The Mexican War diary documents Black's trip from
         Christiansburg to Norfolk and eventually Buena Vista, but
         includes little information about serving in the war. Both
         diaries consist mainly of Black's observations about the towns
         and cities he passes through. The diary of the trip west
         includes comparisons of culture and society in Virginia and
         the West and references to encounters with Virginians who had
         moved west.</p>
         <p>General Correspondence spans the period 1847 to 1871. It is
         comprised of two letters Black wrote while he was studying
         medicine at the University of Virginia, his proposal of
         marriage to Mary (Molly) Kent, and a folder of letters Black
         received from family members between 1848 and 1871. Included
         are a letter describing pioneering in Island County,
         Washington Territory, in 1853; and two letters from Virginia
         State Senator John Penn regarding the establishment of the
         Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, forerunner of
         Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg.</p>
         <p>The Medical Career Records series spans the years 1848 to
         1888. It is comprised of documents pertaining to Harvey
         Black's medical career before and after the Civil War and
         letters of recommendation for the position of Superintendent
         of the Eastern Lunatic Asylum of Virginia and the Southwestern
         Lunatic Asylum of Virginia. This series also contains an 1887
         annual report for the Southwestern Lunatic Asylum of
         Virginia.</p>
         <p>The Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College Records
         span the years 1870 to 1873. This small series is comprised of
         a subscription list for the Preston and Olin Institute, an
