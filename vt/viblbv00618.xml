</head>
<p>Richard Colburn enlisted with Company B of the 12th Infantry, Army of the Potomac, where he served as a cook to the unit. Colburn was wounded and taken a prisoner of war by General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia beginning on June 27, 1862, most likely from the confederate victory at the battle of Gaines' Mill. He was discharged from the hospital on January 15, 1863. In the diary, Colburn mentions exchanging letters with his wife, Elmira and other family members: Maryetta, Oliver, Lewis, and Rhoda.

<p>The Army of the Potomac was organized at Fort Hamilton, New York under the direction of President Lincoln on May 4, 1861, and confirmed by Act of Congress on July 29, 1861. The Army of the Potomac fought in several battles including: Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg. During the term of service, the regiment lost 126 soldiers by death from wounds and 193 men by death from diseases. </p>
