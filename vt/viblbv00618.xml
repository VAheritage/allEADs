      <p>Born in Ohio on 8 October 1832, son of Francis Noble Colburn (born, New York) and
                wife, the former Caroline Bloss (born, Vermont), Richard Colburn enlisted in the
                12th Infantry of the United States Regular Army on 18 December 1861. His home at the
                time of his enlistment, as indicated in the diary, was Ellington, Iowa, in Hancock
                County. Colburn served as a cook with Company B of the 12th Infantry Regiment, which
                was attached for much of the war to the Army of the Potomac. He was wounded--shot
                through the calf--and captured at the Battle of Gaines' Mill on 27 June 1862. After
                recuperating for about a month in Confederate hospitals, he was transferred to Union
                custody and eventually was taken to Philadelphia to continue his convalescence. He
                was released from the hospital on 15 January 1863 and returned home.</p>
      <p>His diary mentions several relatives as either recipients or writers of letters.
                Among them are his wife, Elmira, to whom he was married on 7 May 1861; brothers,
                Oliver, Parley, Francis, and Lewis; sisters Maryetta and Rhoda; and brother-in-law
                J.C.[?] Heckart. Other siblings included Paul, Lorenzo, and Harvey. (History of
                Kossuth, Hancock, and Winnebago Counties, Iowa reports that Paul, a member of an
                Illinois regiment, was killed near Richmond and Lorenzo died in hospital, a member
                of the Wisconsin 12th. A Paul Colburn of the Illinois 93rd was killed at Champion
                Hills, MS in May 1863. A Lorenzo Colburn of the Iowa 23rd died of disease in June
                1863 at Young's Point, LA. A Harvey Colburn, also of the Illinois 93rd was
                discharged in January 1863. A Lewis Colburn of Hancock Co. Iowa and a member of the
                2nd Iowa Cavalry, died of disease in June 1865 in Eastport, MS.) Colburn's first
                wife, Diana (Diena) died in Ellington in April 1858, shortly after the death of
                their infant daughter, Calista.</p>
      <p>According to the 1870 census, Richard and Elmira lived in Ellington, Iowa with sons
                Amos, Francis, John, and daughter Caroline. Also in Ellington in 1870 are his
                parents, F.N. Colburn and wife Caroline, along with his brother Parley and his
                family. The 1880 census shows Richard Colburn in Ellington with wife Anna (his
                second wife Elmira died in 1872), age 26, from Holland, with sons Francis and John,
                young daughter Diena, and two nieces and nephews, both from Holland. Later census
                records show Anna's place of birth to be Denmark. Richard Colburn died on 2 December
                1907 in Kingman, Arizona.</p>

      <p>The Army of the Potomac was organized at Fort Hamilton, New York under the direction
                of President Lincoln on May 4, 1861, and confirmed by Act of Congress on July 29,
                1861. The Army of the Potomac fought in several battles including: Bull Run,
                Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg. During the term of
                service, the regiment lost 126 soldiers by death from wounds and 193 men by death
                from diseases.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection consists of the Civil War diary of Richard Colburn, an enlisted
                soldier of the 12th Infantry of the United States Regular Army attached to the Army
                of the Potomac. The diary contains entries from December 18, 1861 to February 17,
                1863 and details camp life, daily activities, battles, and experience as a prisoner
                of the Confederate army. It traces Colburn's first days in the army in Iowa and his
                travel from 14 February 1862 when he left Iowa to his arrival at Fort Hamilton in
                New York City two days later and his continuing journey to Washington DC. Upon
                arrival in Washington, Colburn notes that he "put in to help cook." Many of his
                subsequent entries include brief notations of cooking for the men. Expecting to
                march to Manassas Junction from Washington, he moved first to Camp California, just
                outside Alexandria, VA, and from there to Fort Monroe in late March 1862.</p>
      <p>The 12th Infantry, marching from Fort Monroe, became involved in the Peninsula
                Campaign, which lasted into July 1862. Coburn refers to "the hard battle between
                Yorktown and Richmond" (Battle of Williamsburg) on May 5th and makes reference to
                Big Bethel and Camp Winfield Scott where he was camped. On Friday 27 June 1862,
                Coburn was engaged in the Battle of Gaines' Mill and writes, "marched off to the
                left where we had a heavy battle where Maj. Clitz [Henry Boynton Cliz] myself and
                several others were wounded and taken prisoner by the 5th regiment Va, with some
                that was not wounded, many killed." The remainder of the diary describes his time
                in hospital, both Confederate and Union, his eventual release on 15 January 1863,
                and his trip home. Colburn's last entry is dated 17 February 1863 when he was in
                Southington, Ohio visiting his sister on his way, presumably, to Iowa.</p>
