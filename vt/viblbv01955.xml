      <p>This collection includes letters written by Joseph T. Harris of the 12th Ohio Infantry to
        his sister, Mollie Swope from various locations in western Virginia. The letters are dated
        August 6, 1861, September 18, 1861, November 23, 1861, and February 14, 1862. The letters
        detail the movements of the 12th Ohio Infantry during actions in the Kanawha Valley,
        Virginia in 1861 as well as camp life.</p>
      <p>The letter dated August 6, 1861 was written from Camp Gauley, Virginia. Harris writes that
        his camp is in the Kanahwa Valley writing on his knee while sitting on his knapsack. Harris
        describes how he was living, eating, and his pay. The letter written in September describes
        Harris' regiment's movements and an engagement at Grate Meadows, as well as how the Colonel
        of the 12th Ohio was killed; the band being sent three miles to the rear; and the amount of
        casualties. The letter written November, 23, 1861 lists some movements of regiment's camp in
        the Kanawha valley. Harris describes his rations as being good and lists what he is being
        issued and getting food from the locals. "We have all theas things, besides what we can
        steal witch is a good deal. Steal did I say, well I will have to take that back for us boys
        have quit stealing and took to takeing a good menny things without leave." He complains
        about not being paid Letter and the cold weather. The February 14, 1862, letter describes a
        recent fifteen day furlough home Harris enjoyed and missed seeing his sister. </p>
