      <p>Charles B. Gardner, likely owner of this ledger, was born in Virginia on August 10, 1813.
        He married Mary J. L. Miller (1817-1873), and the couple had six children. The 1840 census
        shows Gardner living in Montgomery County, Virginia, and owning two slaves. In the 1850
        census, Gardner is described as a 36-year-old merchant, living in Christiansburg with his
        wife and family. The Gardners reported owning three slaves that year. </p>
      <p>Gardner was active in the business community of Christiansburg and eastern Montgomery
        County. In 1842, he was named one of the directors of the Lafayette and Ingles Ferry
        Turnpike Company, and in 1853, he was among a group of businessmen who purchased the nearby
        Yellow Sulphur Springs resort. He also served as cashier of Christiansburg's Bank of the
        Valley of Virginia and is identified as a bank cashier in the 1860 census. (In that year,
        Gardner was the owner of six slaves.) He is likely the same C. B. Gardner who maintained the

          the Confederate States Ledger" (Ms1984-001)</extref>. Charles B. Gardner died November 24,
        1875.</p>
      <p>Eugenia Victoria Sullivan, daughter of Thomas E. and Emily Shuptrine Sullivan, was born on
        August 6, 1862. The 1880 census describes her as a 17-year-old Georgia native, living in the
        Christiansburg, Virginia home of her grandmother, Mary A. Sullivan. Eugenia Sullivan
        graduated from Montgomery Female Academy (Christiansburg) in 1886. An article in the <title
          render="italic">Roanoke Times </title> of August 21, 1891 noted that Sullivan was
        departing for New York, to finish her art studies, and added that she was already known for
        her artistic works. The 1940 census lists a Eugenia V. Sullivan living in Christtiansburg
        with younger sister Maude, but she is described as 67 (rather than the expected 77) years
        old and born in Virginia. Sullivan died August 22, 1941 and was buried in Christiansburg's
        Sunset Cemetery.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a single ledger, maintained by an unidentified store in
        Christiansburg, Virginia in 1856. Entries in the volume, spanning March through September,
        1856, provide customer names and transaction totals. </p>
      <p>Evidence suggests that the ledger may have belonged to Charles B. Gardner, described by the
        1850 census as a 36-year-old merchant living in Christiansburg. The spine of the ledger is
        embossed with the notation "C G &amp; Co."</p>
      <p>The ledger was later used as a scrapbook, apparently by Christiansburg teacher Eugenia V.
        Sullivan. Among the items that are preserved in the volume are: a souvenir from the
        International Cotton Exposition (Atlanta), 1881; prose and poetry clipped from various
        newspapers; a Christmas card published by S. Hildesheimer; a sewing pattern fragment; a
        calling card from Tallant &amp; Co., of Christiansburg; several locks of hair; botanical
        specimens; and transcriptions of published poems. </p>
