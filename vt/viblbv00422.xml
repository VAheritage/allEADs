<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>John McCauley was a resident of Salem, Virginia during the Civil War. He was most likely the same John McCauley (1795-1864) who played a prominent role in the formation of Roanoke County and represented the county in the Virginia General Assembly for approximately 17 years. With his second wife, Susan Dingledine McCauley, he fathered eight children: William, Calpernia, Isabella J., Virginia V., Edward A. (born ca. 1844), Charles A., Mary M., and Antoinette ("Nettie"). Another four children had been born to an earlier marriage.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection consists of a letter from John McCauley, a resident of Salem, Virginia during the Civil War. Writing from Salem to "Edward" (most likely Edward A. McCauley) McCauley describes his recent trip and arrival at home. He advises Edward against accompanying his fellow soldiers when they steal from the local populace at night. ("You are stationary. There are few of you, and once suspected, the innocent among you will suffer in character with the guilty," he warns.) McCauley also relays news of an upcoming benefit exhibition being staged for soldiers in the area, to include "dialogues, music, tableau and a supper." McCauley predicts that the event will draw "a big crowd of spectators... if the small pox does not so spread as to prevent it."
