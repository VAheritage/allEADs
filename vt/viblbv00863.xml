                <p>The processing and description of the Bergen County, New Jersey General Store
                    Account Book commenced and was completed in May, 2011.</p>
                <p>The item was accessioned and originally cataloged as "General Store Day Book,"
                    but a closer examination of the piece during processing revealed it to be an
                    account ledger, rather than a day book. Research through a census check of the
                    customer names revealed that the volume probably originated from Bergen County,
                    New Jersey. Because the item includes several loose items, receipts issued to a
                    Benjamin Post, it seems likely that Post was the store's proprietor.</p>

            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>An examination of the account ledger indicates that it may have been maintained by
                Benjamin Post of Bergen County, New Jersey. A Benjamin Post married Margaret
                Maysinger (1802-1866) ca. 1820 in Bergen County. The 1850 census lists a 60-year-old
                carpenter named Benjamin Post living in Bergen County's Hohokus Township. Also in
                the household were 58-year-old Margaret Post and children Sarah (18), William (14),
                Adaline (8), Matilda (6), and Hannah Jane (2). The census record indicates that all
                had been born in New Jersey. No further record could be found</p>
