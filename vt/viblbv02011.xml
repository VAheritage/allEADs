      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>T. Marshall Hahn, Jr. (1926-2016) served as the 11th president of Virginia Tech and CEO of
        the Georgia Pacific Corporation. Hahn earned a B.S. in physics from the University of
        Kentucky at the age of 18, served two years in the U.S. Navy, and received his Ph.D. in
        physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) at 23. In 1954, Hahn joined
        Virginia Tech as the head of the Department of Physics. </p>
      <p>In 1962, Hahn became the 11th president of Virginia Polytechnic Insitute (VPI). During his
        tenure, he was influential in obtaining university status and changing the institution's
        name to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 1970. Hahn expanded female
        enrollment by severing ties with Radford University, which served as the Women's Division of
        VPI from 1944 until 1964. He was also an advocate of the Virginia Community College System,
        with Virginia Tech becoming the first college or university to accept community college
        students without loss of credit. Additionally, the university dropped the mandatory military
        requirement for male students, created several colleges, and expanded the arts programs. </p>
      <p>Hahn resigned from the university in 1974, becoming the executive vice president of the
        Georgia Pacific Corporation (GP). In 1976, he was promoted to president and 1983 became
        chief executive office, which he served as until his retirement in 1993. He led the
        company's takeover of Great Northern Nekooska, making in the largest paper manufacturer in
        the U.S. at the time.</p>
      <p>T. Marshall Hahn, Jr., married Margaret Louise "Peggy" Lee in 1948, and the couple had
        three children. </p>
