      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Robert Taylor Preston was born at Smithfield Plantation in Blacksburg, Virginia, in
                1809 to James Patton and Nancy Ann Taylor Preston. He was a student at
                Hampden-Sydney College from 1825 to 1828. He qualified as a captain of the 75th
                Regiment of the (Virginia?) Militia in 1830 and was commissioned as Justice of the
                Peace of Montgomery County in 1837. In 1833, he married Mary Hart (1802-1882) and
                they had three children: Virginia Ann Emily (1834-1898), Benjamin Hart (1836-1851),
                and James Patton (1838-1901). Robert Taylor Preston built his residence "Solitude"
                in the early 1830s, and bequeathed the building to the Virginia Agricultural and
                Mechanical College, now Virginia Tech, after his death. At the start of the Civil
                War he was appointed a colonel of the volunteers in the Provisional Army of
                Virginia. In July 1861, he was appointed a colonel of the 28th Virginia Infantry,
                Confederate States of America, where he served until the infantry's reorganization
                in April 1862. Beginning in August 1864 he served as a lieutenant colonel and then a
                colonel of the 4th Virginia Reserves, and surrendered with the troops of General J.
                E. Johnston in North Carolina in April 1865. After the war he continued to reside at
                Solitude until his death in 1880.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection consists of 218 letters, military orders, notes, certificates of
                military appointments, and other items, collected or created by Preston between 1849
                and 1871, with the majority from the period between May 1861 and December 1862. The
                materials include several military orders signed by such members of the Confederate
                Army as Jubal Early, John B. Floyd, and George E. Pickett, as well as orders written
                by Preston himself. Also included is a manuscript draft of a broadside written by
                Preston from Solitude on May 13, 1863, as a call to arms to the men of Roanoke and
                Montgomery County to repel the Union Army which was in the immediate vicinity; and a
                pardon signed by President Andrew Jackson on September 10, 1865, granting Preston
                amnesty for his offenses committed in the recent rebellion.</p>
