            <p>Anthony Rosenstock was born in Melsungen, Hessen-Nassau (present day Germany), on
                October 22, 1833. He immigrated to the United States on November 1, 1853, arriving
                in New York City a month later. He reportedly arrived with just 3¢ and a letter of
                introduction to the brother-in-law of a Kentucky relation. In 1855, he and his
                brother-in-law, Meyer Stern, opened Stern and Rosenstock, a dry goods business,
                which later dissolved in 1857.</p>
            <p>Rosenstock relocated to Petersburg, Virginia, where his sister owned a millinery
                business. He opened his first dry goods store, Temple of Fancy, in December 1858,
                and the next year established A. Rosenstock &amp; Co., one of the first department
                stores in Virginia. By 1863, the Civil War had forced him to close the business, and
                he became involved with running the federal blockade of Virginia's coast.</p>
            <p>Rosenstock was a leader in both the business and the Jewish communities in
                Petersburg. Rosenstock was an original stockholder and later director of the
                National Bank of Petersburg, a founding director of the Petersburg Telephone
                Company, and a director of the Bond and Equity Company. Rosenstock became a
                naturalized citizen on June 17, 1869. He brought members of his extended family to
                the United States, including Isaac, Lewis, and Benjamin Stern, who established Stern
                Brothers, a department store in New York City that eventually became part of Macy’s.
                Rosenstock died on December 17, 1906, in Petersburg.</p>

            <p>The collection consists of a memorandum book presented by A. Rosenstock of
                Petersburg, Virginia, which includes ads and information about the store. The book
                was used by Mrs. Springer, probably of Washington County, VA, to record several
                pages of personal notes dealing with expenses. There is also a scrap of paper with
                writing on it.</p>
