<head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
<p>Otis Jerome Parker (1918-1995), an aerospace engineer, was employed by NASA's Langley Research Center during the 1960s and 1970s. He worked in the Flight Vehicles and Systems Division during the Gemini program
and was named assistant manager of Langley's Apollo Applications Program Experiments Systems in 1969. In 1971, he was assigned the same position in the Skylab program. Parker was largely involved with the design
and development of "jet shoes" and other devices intended to provide maneuverability during astronauts' extravehicular activity in spaceflight. During his work at NASA, Parker was granted patents as inventor or
co-inventor of a despin weight release mechanism, a spacecraft separation system, an ullage compensator and a flared tube strainer.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection contains the papers of Otis Jerome Parker, an aerospace engineer employed at NASA's Langley Research Center during the Gemini, Apollo and Skylab projects. The collection consists largely of a
few NASA publications regarding the design and development of "jet shoes" and other devices intended to provide propulsion and maneuverability during extravehicular activity (EVA) in spaceflight. The collection
also includes Langley inter-office communications regarding Parker and the projects on which he worked, as well as a small set of photographs of Parker and EVA propulsion devices. With the exception of one
photograph, this collection consists of photocopied materials.
