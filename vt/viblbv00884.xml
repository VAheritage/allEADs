      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection consists of a letter written by Dr. Leonard A. Slater to his father, John
        Slater, on October 10, 1862. At the time of the letter Leonard A. Slater was serving as a
        surgeon in the 15th Virginia Calvary at General Hospital No. 23 in Richmond, Virginia. The
        letter details items that L.A. Slater sent had sent home to his family in New Kent County.
        These items include whiskey "well sealed with wax" as well as medicine for his mother's
        headaches. In the letter Slater also advises his father to take his slaves and leave his
        home and furnishings for the Yankees rather than lose his slaves to Union troops. He advises
        that losing the family home, Slatersville, would be preferable to being "subject to the
        brutal insults of the same (Union soldiers)."</p>
