            <p>Soon after David Earhart's death, his wife Mary
            Elizabeth moved back to her parents home, Thornspring Farm,
            in Pulaski County and took the letters with her. They
            remained there for over a hundred years. Ownership of the
            Caddall home passed from Mary's father, John Caddall, to
            her brother James B. Caddall in 1880, and to his niece Mary
            Cecil Stephens in 1906. The farm, the home, and much of the
            contents, including 29 of the letters, passed in 1949 to
            Margaret Painter Perdue, daughter of Mary Cecil Stephens
            and Thomas Morrison Painter, and at her death in 1975 to
            her children, Carolyn Cecil Perdue Johnson and Thomas
            Perdue. This information was provided by Thomas M. Perdue
            in September 2001.</p>

         <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
         <p>David G. Earhart was born in 1834 in Montgomery County,
         Virginia, the fourth child of George Earhart and Nancy Taylor.
         He married Mary Elizabeth Caddall (1833-1887) of Thornspring
         Farm in Pulaski County. They had a son, George Fitzhugh
         Earhart, who was born in 1862 and died when he was eight
         months old.</p>
         <p>Earhart left his wife and infant son in April 1862 to join
         the Stonewall Jackson Brigade, 4th Virginia Infantry. During
         Earhart's service, the Stonewall Brigade was engaged in the
         Shenandoah Valley Campaign (May and June 1862), the Seven Days
         Campaign near Richmond (June 25 to July 1, 1862), the Battle
         of Cedar Mountain, near Culpeper (August 9, 1862), Second Bull
         Run (August 30, 1862), Harpers Ferry (September 15, 1862),
         Antietam (September 17, 1862), Fredericksburg (October 20,
         1862), and Chancellorsville. Earhart was killed in the battle
         of Chancellorsville on May 3, 1863.</p>
         <p>After the war, Mary Elizabeth Earhart returned to live with
         her parents on their farm in Pulaski County and lived there
         until her death in 1887.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The David Earhart Collection spans the years 1862 to ca.
         1880 (bulk 1862-1864). It is organized into the following
         series: Outgoing Correspondence, Miscellaneous Correspondence,
         and Pictures.</p>
         <p>Outgoing Correspondence is comprised of the letters Earhart
         wrote to his family while he was a soldier in the Stonewall
         Jackson Brigade. Letters in this series date from 9 April 1862
         to 26 April 1863. The bulk of the letters (24) are letters
         from David Earhart to his wife Mary Elizabeth, also called
         Mollie. There are also three letters to the family of slaves
         living on his farm (Anchy, Wash, Jeff, Green, Nancy, and
         Susan), two to his parents, and one to his sister Mag. The
         letters contain descriptions of daily life for enlisted men in
         the 4th Brigade and accounts of military actions at Front
         Royal, Petersburg, Winchester, and Sharpsburg (Antietam).
         Earhart describes the effect of the Union occupation of the
         northern Shenandoah Valley on Unionist sympathies there,
         living on meager rations, and the death and destruction he has
         seen on the battlefield.</p>
         <p>In addition to relating news of his experiences, Earhart
         writes of his concerns about his farm and gives specific
         instructions to his wife and family of slaves working the
         farm. He tells his wife how much wool to use for blankets for
         the slave family on the farm and warns the slaves to continue
         working hard.</p>
         <p>In letters to his father, David Earhart discusses his
         unsuccessful effort to buy a substitute to enable him to come
         home and manage the farm. Other subjects include: the death of
         a child, religious faith, disease, Greenwood Hospital in
         Albemarle County, Camp Steavenson, and Camp Winder in Caroline
         County.</p>
         <p>Miscellaneous Correspondence dates from 22 February 1862 to
         1 June 1863. It contains a letter from David Earhart's
         father-in-law John Caddall congratulating David Earhart on the
         birth of his son, George Fitzhugh Earhart, in 1862; a letter
         from J.D. Caddall (David Earhart's brother-in-law) to John
         Caddall informing him of David Earhart's death at the battle
         of Chancellorsville, and a letter from Lieutenant Hamilton D.
         Wade, Earhart's commanding officer, to Mary Elizabeth Caddall
         Earhart regarding Earhart's death and attempts to have his
         body sent home.</p>
         <p>The collection contains three pictures: images (probably
         ambrotypes) of David and Mary Elizabeth Caddell Earhart in
         matching wooden cases, ca. 1862, and a carte de visite, ca.
         1880, of Mary Elizabeth Caddell Earhart.</p>
