      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Charles Wade Crush, Montgomery County judge, historian and
         civic leader, was born in Christiansburg, Virginia, around
         1894; he earned his degree in law from Washington and Lee
         University in 1913. He later attended the University of Texas
         and practiced law in Texas for a short time before returning
         to Christiansburg. During World War II, Crush served with the
         314th Machine Gun Battalion. (Crush's interest in military
         affairs would continue throughout his life, serving as
         commander of the Virginia Department of the American Legion
         and as an officer in Company 161 of the Virginia Reserve
         Militia.) From 1923 to 1935, Crush served as commonwealth's
         attorney. He later served as Christiansburg postmaster for 10
         years and as judge of the county court from 1948 until his
         retirement in 1963. Crush died on March 18, 1970.</p>
      <p>Judge Crush maintained an interest in local history and
         civic matters throughout his career. He wrote numerous
         articles on Montgomery County history for the county newspaper
         and served as chairman of the Montgomery County Jamestown
         Festival Committee in 1957. As a director of the Montgomery
         County branch of the Association for the Preservation of
         Virginia Antiquities, Crush was instrumental in the
         preservation of Smithfield Plantation. His interest in local
         history culminated in the publication of his book, The
         Montgomery County Story, 1776-1957; and is represented in the
         posthumous work Montgomery County, Virginia: the First Hundred
         Years (1982). Through the American Legion, Crush is also
         credited with the founding of Virginia Boys' State.</p>
      <p>Crush's wife, Eliza Clay Allen Crush, was born in Bland
         County, Virginia, in 1898. She attended Virginia Tech, and
         later passed the Virginia bar exam. Like Judge Crush, Mrs.
         Crush also maintained an active interest in local affairs. She
         served as the Christiansburg correspondent for the Roanoke
         Times for 25 years and is credited with founding Girls' State
         at Radford College (now Radford University). She served as
         acting Christiansburg postmaster during World War II and as
         assistant Christiansburg postmaster for six years prior to her
         death in 1966.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection contains county records, correspondence and
         printed materials collected by Judge Charles W. Crush relating
         to the history of Christiansburg and Montgomery County. The
         Crush collection is divided among the following series: County
         Records, Altizer Family Papers, Sullivan Family Papers,
         Politics, Military, Local History, and General Materials.</p>
      <p>The County Records series contains tax records dating back
         to the late eighteenth century, a few scattered court records
         from the early nineteenth century, and records of the
         Montgomery County overseer of the poor from the late
         nineteenth century. The Altizer Family Papers consist of a
         three items of personal correspondence, while the Sullivan
         Family Papers contain receipts and tax records from the latter
         nineteenth century. The collection also contains a small file
         of materials relating to state and local politics during the
         1920s and 1930s. Crush's involvement in recording and
         preserving local history is revealed in both the Military and
         Local History series, the former containing rosters and notes
         on local units, the latter including typescripts and printed
         materials on a variety of subjects relating to early
         Montgomery County history. A small set of general materials
         includes personal papers, ephemera and a photograph of
         Montgomery Male Academy.</p>

      <p>I. Montgomery County Records, 1796-1886, n.d. This series
         contains early tax records, including lists of tithables,
         delinquencies and insolvents compiled by commissioners of
         revenue and deputy sheriffs James and John Hoge, Thomas Henry,
         James Barnett, James Rayburn and William Rutlage. The series
         also contains a number of early records relating to the county
         court's payments on accounts and claims, most notably for work
         done on the courthouse and jail. From the latter nineteenth
         century, the series contains a tax receipt book from the
         Blacksburg district (dated 1884) and a small set of records
         from the county's overseer of the poor, including
         recommendations for assistance signed by overseer George W. L.
         Kabrick and account statements from local businesses.
         Materials are arranged by type, then chronologically.</p>
      <p>II. Altizer Family Papers, 1900-1937 The Altizer Family
         Papers consist of three letters: two written by E. Wesley
         Altizer from Middlecreek, Illinois to relatives in Virginia
         (1900), and one written by Jacob Altizer of Christiansburg to
         Lila Altizer of Roanoke (1937). The letters are arranged
         chronologically.</p>
      <p>III. Sullivan Family Papers, 1872-1895, n.d. This series
         contains papers of Christiansburg's Sullivan family and
         consists largely of receipts and tax records. Mentioned within
         the papers are Arthur O., C. W., Eugenia V., Mary Maude,
         Thomas E. and William Sullivan. Arranged chronologically. (For
         more on the Sullivans, see Ms56-001 - Sullivan Family

      <p>IV. Politics, 1921-1936, n.d. This series contains
         correspondence and printed materials relating to both local
         and statewide campaigns. Included are numerous items
         (correspondence and printed material) concerning Clifton A.
         Woodrum's 1922 congressional campaign, sample ballots and
         Democratic Party printed matter. Arranged chronologically.</p>
      <p>V. Military, 1918-1946, n.d. The Military series includes
         materials relating mostly to local involvement in the Civil
         War and both world wars. The Civil War materials include
         typescript rosters for local units and correspondence, forms
         and notes relating to grave markers of Confederate veterans.
         World War I items include a list of Montgomery County
         veterans, as well as official records and rosters of Company
         A, 314th Machine Gun Battalion (with which Crush and many
         other Southwest Virginia men served). Also filed here are
         printed materials regarding the American Legion, founded by
         World War I veterans. World War II materials include a list
         (with accompanying materials) of Montgomery Countians killed
         in the war and papers of Company 161, Virginia Reserve
         Militia. The series is arranged sequentially by war, then
         chronologically.</p>
      <p>VI. Local History, 1880-1970, n.d This series contains
         various materials relating to the history of Christiansburg
         and Montgomery County. Included are typescript and printed
         articles (written by Crush and others) on early Montgomery
         County history, a file of printed materials regarding the Lee
         Highway opening celebration (1926) and the roadway's historic
         background, and records of the steering committee for
         Christiansburg's 150th anniversary celebration (1957).
         Materials are loosely arranged by historical time period, with
         a file of newsclippings relating to various local history
         topics and periods completing the series.</p>

         and others. Arranged chronologically.</p>
