            <p>Caius Hunter Carpenter was born in Louisa County, Virginia on June 23, 1883. He graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech) with a degree in civil engineering in 1903. After taking a one-year course in law at the University of North Carolina in 1904/1905, he returned to VPI for an additional year of graduate work. A running back, Carpenter played on the VPI football teams of 1899, 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903, and 1905, serving as team captain in 1902. He also played football during his year at the University of North Carolina. Carpenter's most successful season was 1905, when VPI outscored its opponents 305 to 24, with Carpenter accounting for 82 points. The team ended the season with a 9-1 record and was considered the best team in the South that year.</p>
            <p>Following graduation, Carpenter worked as a civil engineer, contractor and fruit farmer. Hunter Carpenter died on February 24, 1953. He was posthumously inducted into the National Football Hall of Fame (today known as the College Football Hall of Fame) in 1957.</p>
