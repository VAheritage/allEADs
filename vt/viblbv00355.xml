<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>On May 29, 1865, President Andrew Johnson issued a proclamation granting amnesty to those who had directly or indirectly aided the Confederate States of America. Upon taking an oath to support, protect and defend the U. S. Constitution, those granted amnesty were restored their property rights (with the exception of slave-holding). A number of groups were excluded from the amnesty offer, but those not granted amnesty could apply to the president for clemency.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection contains a register of men, mostly from Scott County, Virginia, including names, ages, occupations, and places of residence. Though the list is not preceded by a descriptive title, it is believed to be a register of men to whom the amnesty oath was administered following the Civil War. The last 16 names on the list are specifically identified as men to whom the oath was administered. The list contains 1086 names, with ages ranging from 15 to 78 years. While the vast majority are listed as residents of Scott County, a few are from neighboring areas in Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee. Handwritten in the front of the book are three names: "Lieut. J. E. Morse, 1st U. S. Mtd. Rifles, Asst. Provost Marshal, Estillville, Va.;" Lt. Royal V. Paine, 1st Lt. Asst Pro. Mar., Goodson, Va.;" and "[Canny?] A. Walker, Capt. and Asst. Pro. Mar."
</p>
<p>The book also contains several poems, apparently copied from popular publications. One poem, "Good Bye" is signed by Miss Susie C. Primmer of Fredericksburg, Virginia in 1866, though it, too, was copied from a published piece. The final page includes a list of three soldiers to whom Lieutenant R. V. Paine provided transportation to Christiansburg, Virginia.
