      <head>Biographical Note: Herschel A. Elarth</head>
      <p>Herschel Gustave Anderson Elarth, son of Gustave and Amanda Anderson Elarth, was born in
        Omaha, Nebraska on October 15, 1907. Elarth attended the University of Illinois, earning a
        bachelor's degree in architecture in 1929. That same year, he submitted an entry for the
        Prix de Rome in architecture and was awarded first alternate. While attending college,
        Elarth also apprenticed with Omaha architect Thomas R. Kimball. Continuing his studies at
        the University of Illinois, Elarth earned a master of science in architecture in 1930, and
        in 1931, he took second place in the Society of Beaux Arts Architects' Paris Prize.</p>
      <p>From 1931 to 1936, Elarth worked as an architectural designer in the Omaha firm of John and
        Alan MacDonald, playing a significant role in the final design of the Joslyn Art Museum.
        Moving to Los Angeles in 1937, Elarth worked for a year as a draftsman in the office of
        architect Richard J. Neutra. In January, 1938, Elarth took a position as professor of
        architecture at the University of Oklahoma. He married Wilhelmina van Ingen (1905-1969) in
        Norman, Oklahoma on April 2, 1942.</p>
      <p>Elarth joined the U. S. Army in November, 1942. A first lieutenant, he served with the
        826th Engineer Aviation Battalion, supervising the construction and maintenance of
        airfields. Following his honorable discharge in March, 1946, he took special studies at
        Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
      <p>During the summer of 1947, Elarth worked for two months as an architect for the Los Angeles
        City Planning Commission before being hired as an associate professor of architecture at the
        University of Manitoba. While there, he served as a consultant to the Winnipeg Town Planning
        Commission and designed the university's bus terminal and bookstore. He also designed the
        Fort Garry home in which the Elarths would live while in Manitoba.</p>
      <p>In 1954, Elarth was hired as a professor of architecture at Virginia Polytechnic Institute
        and State University. In addition to teaching and advising students, Elarth served as a
        member of the University Council, the VPI Self-Study and University Library Committee, the
        Judicial Committee, and the Wine Awards Committee. He also provided design consultation on
        what would eventually become Cowgill Hall. Early in his career at Virginia Tech, Elarth
        entered into a partnership with fellow architectural professor Charles S. Worley Jr., and
        among the projects they designed were the Montgomery County Public Health Center in
        Christiansburg and the Elarth residence in Blacksburg. Throughout the 1970s, Elarth was
        active in several architectural organizations, and was particularly involved in the
        environmental efforts of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). His contributions to
        architecture were recognized when he was elected a Fellow in the AIA in 1978.</p>
      <p>Elarth married Eva Robert Frook (1917-1984) in Blacksburg, Virginia, in 1971, and he
        retired from the university in 1977. He continued, however, to be active as professor
        emeritus and in several architectural organizations. In 1984, Elarth sold his Blacksburg
        home and moved to Warm Hearth Village retirement community, where he also served on the
        board of directors. Herschel Elarth died in 1988.</p>

        Architectural Engineering from the University of Oklahoma in 1936 and his M.S. in
        Architecture from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1941.</p>
