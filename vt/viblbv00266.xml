<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Hugh Devier, son of Allen and Nancy Turley Devier, was born on May 17, 1818 in Rockingham County, Virginia. He married Alcinda Elizabeth Miller (also a native of Shenandoah County) on March 2, 1847 in Strasburg, Virginia. The couple had several children, including James William, Sarah Virginia, Jacob Allen, Hugh Jr., Mary Elizabeth, Hiram Kyle, Stonewall Jackson, and Nancy Turley.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection contains a legal document signed by Hugh Devier of Shenandoah County, Virginia granting his mother, Nancy Devier of Rockingham County, his power of attorney in the case of Catlett v. Devier heirs. The suit had been brought by Willoughby D. Catlett, guardian of Hiram K. Davis, against the widow and heirs of Allen Devier. The letter gives to Nancy Devier the power to receive in Hugh Devier's name any funds from his share in the sale of his late father's land and slaves, apparently upon settlement of the estate. The letter is attested by Justice O. C. Sterling and is followed by two notes of receipt for money received by Nancy Devier on behalf of Hugh Devier from William G. Thompson, commissioner in the case.
