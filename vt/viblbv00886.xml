      <p>Capt. John Burgess Johnson, son of Rev. Lorenzo Johnson and Mary Johnson was born in
                Plymouth County, Massachusetts, November 29, 1847. He married Laura Minnie Curtis in
                St. Paul, Minnesota on October 9, 1873. John and Laura Johnson had three children,
                Frederick Curtis Johnson (b. 1874), Harold B. Johnson (b.1877), John B., Jr.
                (b.1887).</p>
      <p>Johnson was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant into the 6th US Colored Infantry in
                1863. He fought with the 6th US colored infantry until he was honorably mustered out

      <p>He reenlisted as part of the regular army in 1866 and was assigned to the 7th U.S.
                Infantry as a 2nd Lieutenant. He remained in the army until his death on April 5,
                1896. At the time of his death he had reached the rank of Captain and was assigned
                to the 3rd U.S. Calvary.</p>

      <p>Letter written by Captain John Burgess Johnson to his family while camped near
                Yorktown, Virginia. Letter is postmarked January 19. The letter details a march made
                by the 6th U.S. Colored troops from Glouchester Point to relieve Union calvary
                troops near the Chickahominy River.</p>
      <p>The letter is addressed to "Homefolks," and provides details of the march and describes a
                skirmish between the 6th CT Infantry, the calvary they came to assist and rebel
                scouts. The letter gives details about injuries sustained by both sides and rebel
                prisoners that were taken by the Union calvary. Johnson then describes the march
                back to Yorktown. Throughout the letter Johnson complains of foot pain as a result
                of the march; describing his feet as "swollen" and "just like beef" and tells of
                stopping during the march both on the the way to relieve the calvary and on the way
                back. Both times he describes sitting and watching the rest of his troops march by
                so that he could be picked up by the ambulance and ride the rest of the way to
                camp.</p>
      <p>The original envelope is torn and is addressed to Thomas Barrows. The envelope bears
                a Washington, DC, postmark with the date January 19.</p>
