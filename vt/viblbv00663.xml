        size of the end panels and features the company seal and a chocolate cake on a reproduced
        cloth flour bag. The front of the panels are done in recto color by the American Lithography
        Company of New York, and the back of the panels are printed in black and white and present
        the phrases, "Use Ballard's Obelisk Flour", "Ballard's Obelisk Flour", "Ballard's Obelisk
        the Kind of Flour that Encourages Home Baking", and "A Valuable Premium Ticket in Every Sack
        of Ballard's Obelisk Flour."</p>
      <p> The booklet contains recipes and cooking tips from the Presidents and Directors of the
