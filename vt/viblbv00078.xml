      <p>Mary McClintock Ryland Fessler (1912-2000) was active in
         Montgomery County Democratic Party, local government, and
         civic organizations from the late 1960s through the 1990s. She
         was a founding member of the Montgomery County League of Women
         Voters, organized in 1971, and Secretary of the Montgomery
         County Democratic Committee in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

      <p>Fessler was born in Georgetown, Kentucky, on February 6,
         1912. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Westhampton College
         (now the University of Richmond) in 1932. She taught in the

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Mary Fessler Papers span the years ca. 1940-2001, with
         the bulk of the material dating from 1968-1984. They are
         arranged into the following series: Personal Papers, ca.
         1940-2001; Montgomery County League of Women Voters,
         1948-1980; Montgomery County Democratic Committee, 1967-1993;
         Ninth-District Democratic Committee, 1979-1981; Montgomery
         County Board of Supervisors, 1968-1998; and Blacksburg Library
         Building Committee, 1994-1999.</p>
      <p>The Montgomery County Board of Supervisors series spans the
         period 1968-1998 (bulk 1977-1984) and is the largest series in
         the collection. It is comprised of the following subseries:
         Minutes, 1977-1984; Correspondence, 1978-1985; Financial
         Records, 1977-1995; Subject Series, 1968-1998; Annual Reports,
         1976-1982; Publications, 1974-1984; Capital Improvements
         Program Committee, 1978-1987; Montgomery County Community
         Services Organization, 1974-1979; Montgomery County Planning
         Commission, 1976-1989; and Montgomery County Public Service
         Authority, 1969-1973.</p>
      <p>Minutes contain Fessler's copies of the official minutes of
         Board of Supervisor meetings for the period 1977-1984; they
         also include copies of agendas and official reports submitted
         to the Board. Correspondence is comprised of letters Fessler
         received pertaining to county government issues. It is
         organized into Incoming Correspondence, Inter-office
         Correspondence, both arranged chronologically; and
         Correspondence Regarding, arranged alphabetically by subject.
         Financial Records are comprised of Fessler's copies of budget
         requests, county revenue projections, and financial reports
         and analyses. The Capital Improvements Program Committee,
         Montgomery County Community Services Organization, Montgomery
         County Planning Commission, and Montgomery County Public
         Service Authority series are comprised of copies of records of
         these agencies that were sent to Fessler when she was a member
         of the Board of Supervisors.</p>
      <p>Subject Series, the largest subseries within the Montgomery
         County Board of Supervisors series, are comprised of materials
         Fessler collected and filed by subject and document issues of
         concern to her during her tenure on the Board. They files
         contain a variety of materials, including copies of county
         government documents, correspondence with the county
         government staff, reports, studies, and clippings. Notable
         subjects include construction of the Roanoke River dam,
         landfills, and planning for sewage, water, and refuse.</p>
      <p>The Montgomery County Democratic Committee series spans the
         period 1971-1993 and documents the committee's work in support
         of local, regional, and state Democratic candidates from 1867
         to 1971, 1979 to 1981, and in 1993, and Democratic Party
         conventions. The records are comprised primarily of
         correspondence, get-out-the-vote materials, and newspaper
         clippings. Included is a file of correspondence and clippings
         pertaining to the activities of the state legislature from
         1971 to 1974, a file on the re-drawing of magisterial
         districts in Montgomery County in 1972, and a folder of
         statistics on the race of registered voters, by precinct, in
         Montgomery County, 1979 to 1981.</p>
      <p>The Ninth-District Democratic Committee series dates from
         1977-1981 and is comprised primarily of correspondence from
         officials of the state Democratic Party and members of the
         local and regional committees; it also includes ephemera from
         Democratic campaigns from the period 1980 to 1981. A frequent
         correspondent is state Democratic Party Chair Richard
         Davis.</p>
      <p>The Montgomery County League of Women Voters series spans
         the period 1948 to 1980 (bulk 1970-1980). Just one folder, it
         is comprised primarily of small publications put out by the
         League of Women Voters in the early 1970s promoting
         ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.</p>
      <p>The collection also includes a small series of Personal
         Papers that span the period ca. 1940-2001. They include a
         photograph of Fessler, ca. 1940, and a folder of thank-you
         letters from Virginia Governor Gerald Baliles, Lieutenant

                  managing the activities of the Montgomery County
                  Public Service Authority, which was created by the
                  Board in the early 1970s to manage public utilities
                  in the county. Records include background information
                  on the organization of the Public Service Authority,
                  correspondence, meeting minutes, agendas, financial
                  statements, subject files. Also included is an
                  oversize publication, "Recommended Service Areas,"
                  1975, prepared for the Board of Supervisors. It
                  includes several maps showing existing and planned
                  development and the demand it would create for
                  expanded water and sewer lines.</p>
