      <p>Harriet Eliza Williams, daughter of Charles F. and Eliza Campbell Williams, was born in New
        York City on July 26, 1856. On March 21, 1881, she married William Lathrop, and the couple
        had one daughter. Harriet Eliza Williams Lathrop died died on May 30, 1939, and was buried
        in Montrose Cemetery, Kingston, Pennsylvania. </p>
      <p>William Arthur Lathrop, son of Dr. Israel B. and Mary Elizabeh Bolles Lathrop, was born
        August 4, 1854. He graduated from Lehigh University with a degree in civil engineering in
        1875. From 1881 to 1884, he served as superintendent and engineer of the Southwest Virginia
        Improvement Company, establishing the Pocahontas coal fields and the town of Pocahontas in
        Tazwell County, Virginia. In 1885, he was named superintendent of the bituminous coal
        department of the Lehigh Valley Coal Company. The company promoted him to general
        superintendent at Wilkes-Barre three years later. In 1901, Lathrop became president of the
        Webster Coal &amp; Coke Company; when Webster merged with Pennsylvania Coal &amp; Coke,
        Lathrop became president. In 1906, Lathrop was named manager of the Lehigh Coal &amp;
        Navigation Company, and he was elected president the following year. He also served as
        president or director of a number of other companies and as president of Lehigh University's
        board of trustees. William Lathrop died in Wilkes-Barre on April 12, 1912.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a photocopied typescript ([27] leaves) of the reminiscences of
        Harriet Eliza Williams Lathrop, a native of New York who, during the 1880s, lived with her
        husband (William Arthur Lathrop) in Tazewell County, Virginia from 1881 to 1884 while the
        latter was employed by the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company to oversee the opening of
        the Pocahontas Coal Field and the building of the town of Pocahontas. Included is a
        foreword, written by Lathrop's daughter, Helen Lathrop Thompson, in 1948 (Lathrop's
        reminiscences seem to have been written around 1936).</p>
      <p>Lathrop's reminiscences commence with the couple's arrival in Dublin, Virginia on November
        21, 1881. From there, Lathrop describes the couple's stops in Pearisburg and Princeton,
        before reaching their destination in Tazewell County, where they initially boarded with the
        Moore family. </p>
      <p>Lathrop documents her interactions with local inhabitants (re-creating the dialogue in
        dialect), the couple's diet and living quarters; and her daily housekeeping routine. She
        also notes her husband's activities in overseeing the building of the town and the opening
        of the coal mines. She describes the initial development of the town of Pocahontas and the
        1884 Laurel Mine explosion that killed 114 miners. Lathrop's reminiscences end around June,
        1884, with the couple leaving Pocahontas for Snow Shoe, Pennsylvania, where William Lathrop
        had accepted a position as superintendent of the bituminous department of the Lehigh Valley
        Coal Company.</p>
