<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Yellow Sulphur Springs resort was built by Charles Taylor between Blacksburg and Christiansburg, Virginia, around 1810. By the 1850s, however, it was a flourishing resort with multiple buildings on the premises. These structures included a grand hotel, guest cottages, and a gazebo under which guests could drink the restorative waters. The resort is the only surviving resort of its kind in Southwest Virginia from the ante-bellum period. Today, the Yellow Sulphur continues to welcome guests, offering healing spa treatments in a relaxing rural setting.
