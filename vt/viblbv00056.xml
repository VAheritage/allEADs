         <p>Lieutenant Edgar R. Knapp (ca. 1836-?) of Adrian, Lenawee
         County, Michigan, was a steward at the United States military
         hospital in Annapolis, Maryland from 1862-1864. His brother H.
         Knapp was probably Henry Knapp (1813-1893), who is listed in
         the 1860 census as a doctor in Adrian, Lenawee County,
         Michigan. Randolph Knapp, whose death is the subject of some
         of the correspondence, was born in 1840 in Michigan and died
         at the Battle of Gettysburg.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The Edgar Knapp (ca. 1836-?) Letters span the years
         1862-1864 and are comprised of 40 letters received by Edgar
         Knapp while he was working as a hospital steward at the U.S.
         military hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. They are divided
         into Family Correspondence and Hospital Correspondence. The
         collection also contains two invitations to Masonic functions
         in Baltimore, Baltimore Commandery No. 2.</p>
         <p>The Family Correspondence series date from 1862 to 1863. It
         contains 16 letters from Edgar Knapp's brother H. Knapp and
         one from his sister, both of whom were living in Adrian,
         Michigan, during the war. Like Edgar, H. Knapp was a medical
         man. He avidly followed war news and related political events
         and kept Edgar informed about work and family life in Adrian.
         Both H. Knapp and his sister were civilian supporters of the
         Union who did not (during this correspondence) support radical
         abolitionists. H. Knapp is an unusually capable correspondent
         who animates every topic he discusses, from the family's
         horses (e.g. "He is black (and) sleek as a mole...tough as a
         knob, got a good swingel (and) bollox.," to the feared loss of
         their brother Randolph at Gettysburg. Two letters relay news
         from the front 16 and 17 July: "Ran went into Battle of the 3d
         July (and) charged on the left flank of Genl Lee, where they
         had the Infantry to deal with." Additional details extend over
         three closely written pages.</p>
         <p>Hospital Correspondence contains letters Knapp received
         from soldiers for whom he was responsible when they were
         recuperating in Annapolis. It also includes letters from
         deceased soldiers' parents, who wrote to Knapp requesting that
         he send specified personal effects, their son's body, or
         information regarding their child's final days. Letters in
         this series date from 1862 to 1864. Together with his letters
         from home, in which the battlefield loss of a brother figures
         prominently, this correspondence provides insight into the
         news and daily concerns that passed through the mind of a
         military hospital steward during the Civil War.</p>
