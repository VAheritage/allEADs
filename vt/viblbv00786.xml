            <p>William MacFarland Patton, the son of John M. and Margaret William Patton, was born
                in Richmond, Virginia on August 22, 1845. He attended the Virginia Military
                Institute during the Civil War and served with the cadet corps in the Battle of New
                Market in 1864. Patton graduated from VMI in 1869 and left Virginia to engage in
                engineering in Central America and the Caribbean. Patton became an adjunct professor
                of civil egineering at VMI in 1873 and was promoted to full professor the following
                year, when he was also comissioned a colonel of hte state militia, a position he
                would hold until 1882, when he returned to private enterprise. During the next five
                years, he was involved in construction of the B&amp;O Railroad Susquhanna River
                bridge at Havre de Grace, Maryland, and the Ohio River bridge at Point Pleasant,
                West virginia, among other projects and also served as chief engineer of the Mobile
                and Birmingham and the Louisville, St. Louis and Texas railways. In 1887, he
                reutrned to VMI as chair of civil engineering and remained for two years. From 1889
                to 1896, Patton was chiefly engaged in writing <title render="italic">A Practical
                    Treatise on Foundations</title> and <title render="italic">A Treatise on Civil
                    Engineering</title>, while also working on various engineering projects,
                including the Chicago Drainage Canal. In 1896, Patton was appointed the civil
                engineering chair at Virginia Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College (now Virginia
                Tech); he was named the first dean of the university's engineering department in
                1904, and held that position until his death the following year.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection contains the papers of William MacFarland Patton, a professor of
                civil engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute. The collection includes two
                manuscript drafts. The first of these, though incomplete and unidentified,
                represents the supplemental section of the second edition of Patton's <title
                    render="italic">A Pratical Treatise on Foundations</title>. The second draft
                comprises a text book on civil engineering, apparently never published. Together
                with the manuscript pages are printed pages detached from Patton's <title
                    render="italic">A Treatise on Civil Engineering</title>, to be incorporated in
                the new work. The manuscript is accompanied by a cover letter to the publisher from
                Patton. Also within the collection is patent documentation for two inventions by
                Patton: a breakwater and a pneumatic caisson. The collection also contains drawings
                for a bridge designed by McNairy, Claflin &amp; Company of Cleveland, Ohio.
                Completing the collection is the cover of a Virginia Agricultural &amp; Mechanical
                College writing tablet, bearing an early photograph of Academic Building 1 and
                Academic Building 2.</p>
