      <abstract label="Abstract">This collection consists primarily of correspondence and records from the Office of Academic Affairs at Virginia Tech. The papers reflect the many changes at Virginia Tech as it became a university (approved by legislature on June 23, 1970) and as the roles of faculty and the participation of students within the university were defined. There also are materials relating to campus disorders and dissent during 1970 to 1971. Materials are from Leslie F. Malpass' tenure as Vice-President for Academic Affairs (1968-1974); from Alfred H. Krebs' tenure as director of Summer School, as Assistant Vice President of Academic Affairs under Malpass, and as acting Vice President for Academic Affairs from August 1974 until September 1975; and from Donald C. Darnton's tenure as Director of Special Programs, which also was under the Office of Academic Affairs.</abstract>

      <p>The Office of Vice-President of Academic Affairs was established in 1966. The title changed
        to Provost by the Board of Visitors on November 5, 1976. It evolved into the Senior Vice
        President and Provost, and in 2015, it became the Executive Vice President and Provost.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note - Leslie F. Malpass</head>
      <p>Leslie F. Malpass (1922 - 2011) studied at the University of Cincinnati and Cincinnati
        Conservatory of Music. He earned degrees in psychology at the University of Syracuse, a B.A.
        in 1947, a MA in 1949, and a Ph.D. in 1952. </p>
      <p> Malpass served as Dean of the Virginia Tech College of Arts and Sciences from 1965 until
        1968, when he became Vice President for Academic Affairs. In this position, he was
        responsible for the academic functioning of the university. </p>
      <p> In August 1974, Krebs left Virginia Tech to assume the post of President of Western
        Illinois University (WIU). During his tenure (1974-1887), he supervised the construction of
        the architecturally notable University Library, which was renamed in his honor and
        rededicated as the Leslie F. Malpass Library in 2001. </p>
      <p> Malpass wrote numerous book, monographs, and refereed journal articles. Besides his
        teaching activities, he was involved in the planning and organization of the Special
        Olympics. He also was a consultant to the development of the Peace Corps.</p>
