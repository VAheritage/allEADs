      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>A native of Ohio, Ulysses S. Grant (1822-1885) graduated from the U. S. Military Academy in
        1843. He joined the Union Army in 1861. After leading Union forces during the Vicksburg
        Campaign (1863), he was appointed commanding general of the United States Army in March,
        1864 and commanded the army through victory a year later. In 1868, Grant was elected the
        18th president of the United States and was re-elected in 1872. Following his presidency,
        Grant travelled abroad, campaigned unsuccessfully for a third presidential term, and wrote
        his memoirs. He died in Wilton, New York. </p>
      <p>The scrapbook contains no biographical information on its presumed compiler, Henry Etter
        Starr. A Henry Etter Starr was born in Middletown, Pennsylvania in 1893. In 1921, he married
        Anna Spiesman, and the couple would have two children. Starr obtained a BS in science from
        Gettysburg College and earned a Ph.D. at University of Pennsylvania in 1922 while teaching
        courses there in physiological chemistry, toxicology, and psychology. In 1928, he became
        director of the Rutgers Psychological and Mental Hygiene Clinic. Henry Etter Starr died in
        New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1935. </p>

      <head>Content Description</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a single scrapbook, containing newspaper clippings about U. S.
        President Ulysses S. Grant. Most of the clippings are laudatory in nature and relate to
        Grant's younger years, his military career, and his burial. Included is a clipping from the
          <title render="italic">Harrisburg Independent</title> of July 23, 1885, announcing Grant's
        death. Also included are two memorial flyers printed after the death of President William
        McKinley. Most of the clippings appear to be from Pennsylvania newspapers. The name of the
        scrapbook's likely compiler, Henry Etter Starr, appears on the volume's first leaf.</p>
