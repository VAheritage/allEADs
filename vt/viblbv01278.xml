John Jamison was a business man in Franklin County who married Catherine Boone in 1806 and had 11 children. John kept detailed records of his business dealings and transactions, as well as serving as a private for the Confederacy during the Civil War. He died in Franklin County in 1864, leaving his estate to the widowed "Caty" Boone and his children. Samuel Jamison, John and "Caty's" son, married Sarah Webster, interconnecting two prominent families of Franklin County.</p>
