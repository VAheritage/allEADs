<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Seldon Longley was born February 7, 1846, in Virginia. Although he attended Emory &amp; Henry College in Washington County, Virginia, for some time, he left school to fight in the Civil War, enlisting on April 3, 1864. Longley achieved the rank of Sergeant later that year; however, he returned to school at Emory &amp; Henry College, earning his Bachelor's Degree in 1868 and Master's Degree in 1869. Upon receiving his Master's Degree, Longley went to study law at the University of Virginia until 1870. He began practicing law and, in 1873, was elected to the House of Delegates to represent Washington County, Virginia. On December 24, 1873, Longley married Leona &quot;Lennie&quot; Howard Jordan. He lived in Glade Spring, Washington County, Virginia, with his wife and child. In 1891, Longley moved to Pulaski County, Virginia, and was appointed as judge of the county court in 1897.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The correspondence in this collection deals with varied subjects, such as credit accounts at a mercantile store in Nashville, Tennessee&ndash;Terrass &amp; Yarbrough. While two of the other letters appear to be personal correspondence, a telegram sent to Longley as a member of the House of Delegates in 1873 addressed the Farmer's Bank of Abingdon (Virginia). This telegram and the bank note from the Bank of Abingdon suggest that Longley may have been involved with the institution. Also, in a letter sent to Longley in 1878, the author requests that Longley focus his attention on the &quot;Civil Rights Bill.&quot; This was likely a reference to the Civil Rights Act of 1875 which entitled all individuals to the same use of &quot;public accommodations,&quot; such as theaters and inns. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 was, however, declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1883.
