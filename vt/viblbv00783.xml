            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Clement M. Adkisson, son of Jesse and Jinny Medley Adkisson, was born ca. 1809 in
                Cluster Springs (Halifax County), Virginia. He married Mary Webb Sydnor (1824-1891)
                in 1849. The couple seems to have had one child, a son named William S. Adkisson,
                born in 1857. Adkisson owned and operated a general store at Scottsburg (Halifax
                County) and appears to have partnered, at least temporarily, with a Samuel T.
                Wright. Clement M. Adkisson is recorded by the 1860 federal census as a 51-year-old
                merchant and farmer, living in Scottsburg, Virginia. Also in the household are
                35-year-old Mary W. Adkisson, Willie S. Adkisson (2), Synthia Adkisson (62),
                Mourning Adkisson (53), and several people who were apparently boarders. The family
                continues to be listed among the inhabitants of Halifax County through the 1880
                census.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection contains a single account book, purportedly from the store of Clement
                M. Adkisson, of Halifax County, Virginia. The ledger's entries commence with
                January, 1859 and end in November, 1861. Possibly copied from the store's day book,
                the entries may represent credit transactions. Each entry provides the customer's
                name, a description of items purchased, and the dates and prices of purchases.</p>

                <head>NOTE:</head>
                <p>This item was originally cataloged in Special Collections as the "C. M. Adkinson
                    &amp; Company Account Book." Because the volume had been rebound at some point,
                    any original identifying information from the binding was lost, and the name C.
                    M. Adkinson was derived from a latter-day label on the volume's front endpapers.
                    The new attribution, changing the name to the "C. M. Adkisson Account book," is
                    derived from an examination of the contents and from research. The first entry
                    in this volume is an agreement entered into by C. M. Adkisson and Samuel T.
                    Wright. Furthermore, though the 1870 census did record a 61-year-old merchant
                    named C. M. Atkinson in Halifax County, other reliable sources, including other
                    censuses, record this man's name as Clement M. Adkisson.</p>
