        <p>The processing, arrangement, and description of the Clement M. Adkisson Account book
          commenced and was completed in February 2011. Initial description was completed in or
          prior to May 1970.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Please note:</emph> This item was originally cataloged as the "C. M.
          Adkinson &amp; Company Account Book." Because the volume had been rebound at some point,
          any original identifying information from the binding was lost, and the name C. M.
          Adkinson was derived from a latter-day label on the volume's front endpapers. The new
          attribution, changing the name to the "C. M. Adkisson Account book," is derived from an
          examination of the contents and from research. The first entry in this volume is an
          agreement entered into by C. M. Adkisson and Samuel T. Wright. Furthermore, though the
          1870 census did record a 61-year-old merchant named C. M. Atkinson in Halifax County,
          other reliable sources, including other censuses, record this man's name as Clement M.
          Adkisson. </p>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Clement M. Adkisson, son of Jesse and Jinny Medley Adkisson, was born ca. 1809 in Cluster
        Springs (Halifax County), Virginia. He married Mary Webb Sydnor (1824-1891) in 1849. The
        couple seems to have had one child, a son named William S. Adkisson, born in 1857. Adkisson
        owned and operated a general store at Scottsburg (Halifax County) and appears to have
        partnered, at least temporarily, with a Samuel T. Wright. Clement M. Adkisson is recorded by
        the 1860 federal census as a 51-year-old merchant and farmer, living in Scottsburg,
        Virginia. Also in the household are 35-year-old Mary W. Adkisson, Willie S. Adkisson (2),
        Synthia Adkisson (62), Mourning Adkisson (53), and several people who were apparently
        boarders. The family continues to be listed among the inhabitants of Halifax County through
        the 1880 census.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection contains a single account book, purportedly from the store of Clement M.
        Adkisson, of Halifax County, Virginia. The ledger's entries commence with January 1859 and
        end in November 1861. Possibly copied from the store's day book, the entries may represent
        credit transactions. Each entry provides the customer's name, a description of items
        purchased, and the dates and prices of purchases.</p>
