      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Albert John Davis was born in 1854. He enlisted with the U. S. Army Cavalry (7th Regiment?) at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1876. He spent most of his early military career in the Dakota territories, at Fort Rice and Fort Lincoln, eventually serving for an officer (Colonel Otis) and for the Quartermaster. In 1881, he was able to secure a transfer to the Signal Corps. During the 1880s and 1890s, he served with the Signal Corps and the U. S. Cavalry. By 1897, he was assigned to the Weather Bureau (later the National Weather Service), eventually settling in Norfolk by 1904. Davis died in 1935.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The A. J. Davis Collection includes a journal; photographs, sketches, and ephemera; and a town history. The journal (1874-1901) contains memoirs, particularly of Davis' army experiences, as well as some writing exercises, poetry, stories, and religious observations. A second notebook includes a 19-page history of Woods Hole, Massachusetts, authored by Davis, containing descriptions of the changes to the town, character sketches, and commentary.</p>
      <p>The collection contains a number of photographs. Two loose images depict Davis in the 1890s and in 1907 and a third shows Davis' wife, Jessie. A majority of the images are part of the scrapbook, compiled by the depositor in 1982 and include images from the 1880s and 1890s. Images show people (mostly Native Americans) and places throughout North and South Dakota and Texas (during Davis' military service in these locations). There are also several pieces of personal memorabilia (postcards and business cards). The last few pages include a series of drawings done by a Native American child in 1882.</p>
