<head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
<p>Nevena Stoianova Kechedzhieva was born in 1927 in Sofia, Bulgaria. She studied architecture at Sofia Polytechnic, graduating in 1951. Thereafter, she worked for the State Design Organization, "Glavproekt,"
until her retirement in 1984. In the late 1970s Kechedzhieva was sent to work in Cuba. She worked in Nigeria, the People's Republic of Yemen (Aden) and Mozambique in the early 1980s. Kechedzhieva is also an
accomplished interior designer. Since her retirement, she has continued to design for private clients.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The bulk of this collection consists of architectural drawings created by Nevena Kechedzhieva from 1971 to 1989. It includes residential projects in Bulgaria and commercial projects in Nigeria, Yemen and
Bulgaria. Undated sketches of concept plans and elevations for an unidentified multi-storey building are available. A wall unit sketch and her curriculum vitae are also included. Most of the information on the
drawings is written in Bulgarian. Translated "Sheet Identification" information for the drawings is included in the collection.
</p>
</scopecontent>
<arrangement>
<head>Arrangement
</head>
<p>The drawings are grouped by project and stored by size. The smaller sketches and the translated "Sheet Identification" information for most of the drawings are stored in the flat box. Oversize drawings for the
Sunny Coast Resort in Bulgaria are stored rolled. The rest of the drawings are stored in oversize folders.
</p>
<p>In order to provide translation information for the Bulgarian on each sheet, all the drawings stored in oversized folders have a pencil notation on the left of the title block along the bottom edge that
included the initials "IAWA", a letter for that set of project drawings, and the sheet number. The corresponding translation for each drawing is stored in the flat box. For example, more information about the
"Attached Houses for Three Families" in Bulgaria in folder one, marked IAWA D1 to IAWA D8, can be found by looking at the translation sheet under that code.
