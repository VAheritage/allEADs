      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Timothy Fletcher was born on May 9, 1779 in Acton, Massachusetts. When he was just
                twenty-days old, his father died and he was bound out to a farmer for the rest of
                his minority. In 1792, Fletcher left Massachusetts for New York City to search for
                his long lost brother named Daniel. Fletcher made most of the trip alone and on
                foot, covering about fifty miles a day till he reached Bridgeport, Connecticut; from
                there, he sailed to New York.</p>
      <p>In 1803, Fletcher moved to Lincolnville, Maine, where he would spend the rest of his
                life. In that same year, he took up a teaching job, bought a farm, and married Mary
                L. Brown, a Maine native. The couple had several children together. Throughout his
                life, Fletcher was known as an upright man and stout Christian, faithful to the
                Fletcher family's puritan roots. When Fletcher was eighty-five, he wrote in his
                journal that he was, "[still] not too old to hate rum and slavery." He
                died on August 21, 1864.</p>
      <p>Due to his role as a teacher, Fletcher may have been involved in the educational
                case, <emph render="italic">Fletcher vs. Lincolnville</emph> (1841) that reached the
                Maine Supreme Court. The case concerned the posting of meeting notices. Its outcome
                required that notices be posted at both Lincolnville’s grist mill and schoolhouse
                within a reasonable time period before a meeting’s date. Additionally, the ruling
                decided that if an agent of a district was chosen by a group of assembled qualified
                voters, the appointment could only be valid if the meeting was announced
                legally.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection contains a home expense ledger and two papers relating to the sale of
                personal effects.</p>
      <p>The expense ledger is hand-stapled and stitched, encased in a stiff leather cover,
                and contains fifty-four leaves written on with small script. The contents of the
                ledger are household accounts from 1825 to 1833 (listing date, item, and price),
                mostly for food stuffs such as meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, and spices.</p>
      <p>The two papers are lists of effects sold to D.H. Cole. Originally, they were found
                folded and tucked into the ledger.</p>
      <p>The larger piece lists books and pamphlets for sale and is dated September 5, 1832;
                listed books include Shakespeare and Webster’s Dictionary. The backside of the paper
                lists maps for sale, to be sold in lots of five or six.</p>
      <p>The smaller paper features household effects to be sold; the list runs onto the back
                of the page. Dated 1832, this lists includes items such as a shovel, table, boxes,
                and more maps.</p>
