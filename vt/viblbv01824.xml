            <p>The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) started in 1862 when President Abraham Lincoln created the position of Commissioner of Internal Revenue to help raise money to fund the American Civil War. Initially, the IRS collected income taxes, however, taxing income was unpopular and from 1868 to 1913 most taxes collected were "sin taxes" collected on vices such as alcohol and tobacco. To show that the appropriate tax had been paid, stamps were purchased and either affixed to the taxed goods or displayed in the taxed place of business. The stamps were pre-printed with a specific year. Any unused stamps were punch-cancelled by having triangular holes punched in them. These punch-cancelled stamps are referred to as "remainders" by collectors.</p>

            <p>This collection includes a United States Internal Revenue Retail Liquor Dealer Stamp for Special Tax for the year 1876. The stamp is a remainder and has been punch-cancelled since it was not used to document taxes paid during its imprint year.</p>
