      <head>Biographical and Historical Note</head>
      <p>From 1969 to 1971, George Grigg and John Carnochan made animated films using computer-drawn
        images, while students at Virginia Tech's College of Architecture and Urban Studies (CAUS)
        in the Inner College. The Inner College was a program for invited upper level architecture
        students in which the students got to choose their own area of interest for study under
        Professor Olivio Ferrari. </p>
      <p>In 1969, Carnochan began sketching ideas for using a polygon on many scales for multiple
        potential uses, such as for housing. The polygon developed as an elaboration of the space
        surrounding a cube, which in turn enlarged into a a solid polyhedron with 26 faces. This
        conceptual polyhedron design was referred to by the Inner College students as "The Element". </p>
      <p>Carnochan started with a cardboard model, held together with tape, that over time he
        manipulated to change its size and shape as well as dimensions. Additional models of
        different materials, including balsa wood and Plexiglass, were made and photographed. Grigg
        came up with the idea of creating a computer drawing, enabling a view inside the space.</p>
      <p>Before transferring to VPI in 1967, Grigg majored in physics at a university in Ohio, where
        he learned FORTRAN programming. While at VPI, Grigg also took a computer graphics class and
        independent study with adjunct professor Waltner Messcher.</p>
      <p>Using Virginia Tech's IBM 360 computer, the largest in Virginia at the time, Grigg
        programmed in FORTRAN using punch cards. Grigg and Carnochan filmed the drawings on a 16mm
        camera, shooting one frame at a time and moving the drawings one degree of rotation per
        frame. At 24 frames per second, the first film required approximately 1440 individual
        drawings. Actual filming required shooting one computer drawing at a time. They filmed at
        night in the basement of the High School Building, and a small lab in northern Virginia
        developed and edited the film. In the first movie, the module rolled forward rotating on all
        three axes, beginning far away and ending in the foreground exactly in the middle of the
        screen. </p>
      <p>After viewing the first film, Professor Ferrari asked Grigg to teach students to program
        and draw as part of their design class. In order to program, the College received its own
        punch card machine.</p>
      <p>George and John continued making computer movies. Later movies became more complex. The
        film "Finite State Machines" was the longest and most challenging. As part of exploring and
        researching the geometry, a whole family of more complex forms was computer animated
        demonstrating not only the deformation but the geometrical packing. The computer animation
        was making possible views that were simply not possible to achieve any other way. John had
        modified the original cardboard model by making the square faces open instead of solid. That
        led to the discovery that if the square faces were not solid, the model could collapse onto
        itself. The edges of the rectangles could be made to touch each other to form four prism
        "legs" extending from a solid tetrahedron in the center. If the proportions of the sides
        were 1: 1.41: 1, the triangles of the diagonally opposite corners would come together,
        forming a collapsed "crown" that could form a joint between two other non-collapsed
        modules.</p>
      <p>In January 1969 George joined the Society of Amateur Cinematographers and he and John
        entered the movie in a computer film competition in Los Angeles. This was the first showing
        of the film outside of VPI. The film did not win a prize, but Grigg and Carnochan also
        learned about the Association for Computing Machinery and entered their 2nd Annual Computer
        and Music Exhibition in August 1969. (This exhibition has now become ACM Siggraph, the
        largest computer graphics exposition and conference held annually in California.) The movie
        was shown at the 1970 annual convention of the Virginia Society of Architects. It was also
        shown to several mathematics clubs at various Virginia state colleges and one in Kentucky.
        The same year the Inner College also built a large scale module out of aluminum angles to
        serve as the notice board for Tech Festival, an annual showcase for interested businesses
        and students to get acquainted with each other.</p>
      <p>After graduating from Virginia Tech, Grigg taught in the Foundation Division of the College
        of Architecture for one year and then went into the practice of architecture (with
        occasional detours into teaching). The majority of his architectural projects focused on
        healthcare facilities. He retired in 2010.</p>
      <p>Carnochan pursued a film career, editing a number of documentaries, live action features
        and TV shows. He returned to animation during the renaissance at Disney, where he edited
          <emph render="italic">The Little Mermaid</emph> and <emph render="italic">Beauty and the
          Beast</emph>. Subsequently, he edited the computer-animated films <emph render="italic"
          >Ice Age</emph> and <emph render="italic">Robots</emph>. He lives in Los Angeles and
        continues to work in the U.S. and internationally, primarily in animation.</p>
      <p>An extended history and information about the film is in Box 1, Folder 1.</p>

      <head>Content Description</head>
      <p>This collection includes documents related to the production and dissemination of George
        Grigg's and John Carnochan's computer-animated film, produced while students at Virginia
        Tech from 1969 through 1970 using FORTRAN. The papers also relate to a computer class Grigg
        taught after creating the film and include printed slides for a presentation about the film
        at VT for the 50th anniversary of the College of Architecture and Urban Studies (CAUS).
        There is a DVD and 16mm film reels of the animation, along with story boards, 3D models,
        photographs, correspondence, and more. The first folder of box 1 contains Grigg's and
        Carnochan's history of the film and description of the process.</p>
