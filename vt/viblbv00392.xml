<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The 37th Virginia Infantry was organized primarily in Lee, Russell, Scott and Washington counties in the spring and summer of 1861. The regiment trained in Richmond, then spent the autumn of 1861 in the Shenandoah Valley area. In 1862, it participated in Jackson's Valley Campaign, then in the Seven Days' battles on the Virginia peninsula. At the Battle of Cedar Mountain, the regiment suffered heavy casualties. Later that fall, the regiment saw action at Antietam and was present at the Battle of Fredericksburg. The regiment also fought at both Chancellorsville and Gettysburg. In 1864, the 37th was only briefly engaged in the Battle of the Wilderness but was nearly decimated just days later at Spotsylvania Court House. The remainder of the regiment fought in several more major battles before being ordered to the defense of Petersburg in late 1864. At the time of surrender in April 1865, only 39 members of the regiment remained with the regiment.
