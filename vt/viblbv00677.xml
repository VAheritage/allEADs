   <head>Biographical/Historical Information </head>
   <p>Benjamin Say, the seller of the land deed, was a "physick" or physician based in Philadelphia,
    PA. The purchaser of the land deed, Richard Mason, was a merchant who came from the same city. </p>
   <p>Harrison County, where the 5,000 acres of land were mainly situated, was created from
    Monongalia County in 1784; it was named for Benjamin Harrison, a signer of the Declaration of
    Independence. In 1787, the same year of the deed's creation, the first courthouse was built in
    Harrison County. Monongalia County, where a portion of the land was also situated in, was
    founded eight years earlier in 1776. In the national census of 1790, Monongalia County had the
    sixth largest population out of nine counties that make up present-day West Virginia at 4,768
    inhabitants. </p>
