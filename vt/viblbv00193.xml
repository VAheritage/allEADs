Fuller, or "Bucky" to his friends and colleagues, was most well known for his invention of the geodesic dome, a ground-based dome with no limiting dimensions.  The collection contains unsigned correspondence by Fuller and others, as well as various articles on architecture and the geodesic dome, nature, utopian design, space and science.

      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>R. Buckminster Fuller was born in Milton, Massachusetts on July 12, 1895.  He attended Harvard University from 1913-15, but never finished his degree.  He attended the U.S. Naval Academy in 1917 and served as an officer in the U.S. Navy during World War I.  In 1954, Fuller patented the geodesic dome, the structure he is most famous for as an architect.  The U.S. Pavilion, a geodesic dome designed by Fuller, was a main feature of the Canadian Universal and International Exhibition in 1967.  Fuller was also the inventor of a "dymaxion" car as well as a "dymaxion" world map, a map which limited the distortions that are common with most world maps.  Fuller was not just an inventor and architect, but also a philosopher and poet.  He published many books and articles throughout his life, both fiction and non-fiction.  Fuller's contributions as a poet, philosopher, architect and inventor have made him the subject of numerous books and articles, as well as earning him many honorary degrees and awards.</p>
