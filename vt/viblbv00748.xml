            <p>Lillian Diana Gish was an American actress, best known for her appearance in such
                silent screen classics as Birth of a Nation and Orphans of the Storm. Born October
                14, 1893, died February 27, 1993. She spent over 75 years on the sreen (1912- 1987).
                Her most prominate films were of the 1910s and 20s, with D.W. Griffith as the
                director. AFI listed Gish as 17th among the greatest female stars of all time. She
                was awarded an Honorary Academy Award in 1971, and in 1984 she received an AFI Life
                Achievement Award.</p>
            <p>Lillian Gish never married or had children. The association between Gish and D. W.
                Griffith was so close that some suspected a romantic connection, an issue never
                acknowledged by Gish, although several of their associates were certain they were at
                least briefly involved. For the remainder of her life she always referred to him as
                "Mr. Griffith."</p>
