</head>
      <p>Claybrook Y. Lain (variously spelled Lane and Layne) was born in Albemarle, Virginia, to Elizabeth Lain.  In Richmond, on April 23, 1861, Lain joined the 15th Virginia Infantry.  In 1862, Lain was promoted to first sergeant and between August and October of 1863, he became the regimental commissary sergeant.   Lain died during the Battle of Drewry's Bluff, on May 16, 1864, and left behind his mother as sole beneficiary--Lain was unmarried.
</p>
      <p>The 15th Virginia Infantry, initially called the 3rd Virginia Regiment, was originally formed from ten companies taken from Richmond and its surrounding area--some companies even predated the southern states' succession from the Union.  The original company names were:  Henrico Grays, Virginia Life Guards, Patrick Henry's Rifles, Henrico Guard, Ashland Grays, Emmett Guard, Henrico Southern Guard, Young Guard, Hanover Grays, and Marion Rifles.  These companies later held alphabetical designations.  (A relatively diverse "regiment," the Emmett Guard was composed largely of Irish citizens while the Marion Rifles included German citizens.)  The 15th Virginia Infantry was involved in significant battles at Bethel Church, Savage Station, Malvern Hill, South Mountain, and Sharpsburg.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The 15th Virginia Infantry History is a handwritten account by enlisted soldier Claybrook Y. Lain regarding the formation and activities of a Confederate regiment from 1861 to 1862.  Lain, writing as an omniscient narrator, only infrequently refers to himself within the text.  Significant topics within the history include:  the creation of the "15th Virginia Regiment," the background of individual companies and the merit of their commanders, the Battle at Bethel Church, the dearth of supplies, the use of alcohol, the movement of soldiers, and the management of the camp by a colonel from the Virginia Military Institute.  Lain writes of a particularly interesting incident in which the students from the Virginia Military Institute, aiding in camp management, attempt to trick a soldier out of his musket only to find that the soldier retained a six shooter and could forcibly recover his firearm.  Several military commanders are mentioned specifically, and include:  Colonel Harvie, Colonel Thomas P. August, Colonel Gilharn, and Colonel Stuart among others.  Some considerable Virginia locations (cities, camps, and forts) mentioned within the history are Richmond, Williamsburg, Hampton, Yorktown, Newport News, Young's Mill, Camp Adams, and Fort Powhatan. The history ends in 1862; therefore, Lain's history omits the final years of the Civil War and the eventual results of the conflict.  Also included with the 15th Virginia Infantry History are reproductions of Lain's military service records from 1861 to 1864, including specifically records of his enlistment, pay, death, and final beneficiaries.
