<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>William Belew was the fourth child of thirteen, born to Zachariah and Mary (Bullington) Belew, in Union County, South Carolina, on July 13, 1816. Between 1816 and 1818, the family moved to Lauderdale County, Alabama. Some time after 1837, a portion of the family moved again, this time to Lawrence County, Tennessee. In Febraury of 1840, William Belew married Sarah Gould. They would have seven children. Belew was a farmer in Lawrence (and possibly Gibson) County until his death on September 18, 1884. He is buried in the Second Creek Cemetery in Lawrence County, Tennessee.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>In February of 1868, the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee passed &quot;an act to secure the loyal citizens of Tennessee recompense from the United States government for losses incurred by the Rebellion.&quot; A claim had a list of requirements, including the need for a signed statement the claimant was loyal to the Union and had never assisted the Confederate army, signatures of two witnesses swearing to the person's loyalty, witness statements to the acts of damage or theft, and the signature of a military of government official to vouch for the claimant and witnesses.</p><p>
On June 1st of that same year, William Belew filed a claim (numbered &quot;No 39&quot;) for the loss of quartermaster stores on three separate incidents, amounting to more than $2400. Belew's claim presents a detailed list of food goods, livestock, and fodder confiscated by Confederate units. Given the date of events, the units Belew accused of the thefts are likely the 4th Regiment, Alabama Cavalry (&quot;Roddey's Cavalry&quot;) for the theft in 1863; the 6th Regiment, Tennessee Cavalry (&quot;Wheeler's Cavalry&quot;) in 1864; and an unidentified unit of the Army of Tennessee for the second incident in 1864 (attributed to &quot;Hood's command&quot;). Signatures include two of Belew's brothers who witnessed the events, county and state officials, and the Tennessee governor.</p></scopecontent><arrangement encodinganalog="351">
