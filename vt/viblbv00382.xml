      <head>Biographical Information </head>
      <p>William Belew was the fourth child of thirteen, born to Zachariah and Mary (Bullington)
        Belew, in Union County, South Carolina, on July 13, 1816. Between 1816 and 1818, the family
        moved to Lauderdale County, Alabama. Some time after 1837, a portion of the family moved
        again, this time to Lawrence County, Tennessee. In Febraury of 1840, William Belew married
        Sarah Gould. They would have seven children. Belew was a farmer in Lawrence (and possibly
        Gibson) County until his death on September 18, 1884. He is buried in the Second Creek
        Cemetery in Lawrence County, Tennessee. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>In February of 1868, the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee passed "an act to
        secure the loyal citizens of Tennessee recompense from the United States government for
        losses incurred by the Rebellion." A claim had a list of requirements, including the need
        for a signed statement the claimant was loyal to the Union and had never assisted the
        Confederate army, signatures of two witnesses swearing to the person's loyalty, witness
        statements to the acts of damage or theft, and the signature of a military of government
        official to vouch for the claimant and witnesses.</p>
      <p> On June 1st of that same year, William Belew filed a claim (numbered "No 39") for the loss
        of quartermaster stores on three separate incidents, amounting to more than $2400. Belew's
        claim presents a detailed list of food goods, livestock, and fodder confiscated by
        Confederate units. Given the date of events, the units Belew accused of the thefts are
        likely the 4th Regiment, Alabama Cavalry ("Roddey's Cavalry") for the theft in 1863; the 6th
        Regiment, Tennessee Cavalry ("Wheeler's Cavalry") in 1864; and an unidentified unit of the
        Army of Tennessee for the second incident in 1864 (attributed to "Hood's command").
        Signatures include two of Belew's brothers who witnessed the events, county and state
        officials, and the Tennessee governor.</p>
