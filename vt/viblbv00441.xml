<head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
<p>Stingely Shaffer was born in Virginia about 1835. By 1867, he married Elizabeth C., and they had moved to West Virginia. They had two sons: Amos (b. abt. 1867) and Arthur (b. abt. 1873). The family lived in Barbour County until at least 1880.</p>
<p>The oath seems to be the result of the laws enacted by the West Virginia legislature following the Second Wheeling Convention in August of 1861. The Wheeling Convention brought about the creation of the state of West Virginia after forming a Committee on a Division of the State - Virginia. In addition to dividing the existing state into Virginia and West Virginia, this convention brought about the attempted relaxation of the laws against ex-Confederates. </p><p>For more information on the Wheeling Conventions see the <extref entityref="wcon">

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The collection contains a signed oath by the deputy sheriff of Barbour County, West Virginia, stating he had never served with or aided the Confederate Army during the Civil War. While the Wheeling Conventions helped to ease some of the laws restricting the rights of ex-Confederates, not every county was willing to do so. This oath&ndash;written in 1870&ndash;suggests that Barbour County was rather hesitant to allow ex-Confederates to take public offices. The document is signed by Stingley Shaffer and is both witnessed and signed by Louis Wilson.
