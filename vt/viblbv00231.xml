      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>George H. Marshall of Company K, 3rd Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery, was born in
        Pennsylvania, ca. 1835. The son of Sarah Marshall, he lived in Chester County before
        enlisting as a private in Company K of the 3rd on February 23, 1864. He was promoted to full
        artificer on September 3, 1865. After the mustering out of his regiment at Fort Monroe,
        Marshall returned to Chester County, Pennsylvania, where he recommenced working as a
        carpenter. Survived by his wife, Ruth, Marshall died on March 19, 1919 and is buried in the
        Romansville, Pennsylvania Friends Burial Ground. </p>
      <p>The 3rd Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery was organized in Philadelphia by consolidation of
        Segebarth's Battalion of Marine Artillery and the 1st Battalion, Pennsylvania Artillery,
        with two additional companies formed in Philadelphia. The regiment was ordered to Fortress
        Monroe, Virginia, serving at times in Graham's Naval Brigade and engaging Confederate forces
        on the James, Chickhominy and Nansemond rivers. The regiment was mustered out of service at
        Fort Monroe on November 9, 1865. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection contains the diary of George H. Marshall, a soldier in Company K, 3rd
        Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery during the Civil War. The diary contains short entries spanning
        one year, beginning with Marshall's enlistment on February 24, 1864. The diary's early
        entries cover Marshall's enlistment and the movement of his regiment. Later entries, made
        from Fort Monroe, Virginia, at which the 3rd113th was stationed, relate to the daily
        routines of Marshall, his regiment, and the fort. Marshall notes such details as the
        weather, the condition of his health, and his correspondence but also makes mention of
        prisoners of war, African American troops, the wounded, and skirmishes with the
        Confederates.</p>
