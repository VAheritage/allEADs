      <p>George H. Marshall of Company K, 113th Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery, was born in Pennsylvania,
ca. 1835. The son of Sarah Marshall, he lived in Chester County before enlisting as a private in
Company K of the 113th on February 23, 1864. He was promoted to full artificer on September 3, 1865.
After the mustering out of his regiment at Fort Monroe, Marshall returned to Chester County,
Pennsylvania, where he recommenced working as a carpenter. Survived by his wife, Ruth, Marshall died
on March 19, 1919 and is buried in the Romansville, Pennsylvania Friends Burial Ground. </p>
      <p>The 113th Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery was organized in Philadelphia by consolidation of
Segebarth's Battalion of Marine Artillery and the 1st Battalion, Pennsylvania Artillery, with two
additional companies formed in Philadelphia. The regiment was ordered to Fortress Monroe, Virginia,
serving at times in Graham's Naval Brigade and engaging Confederate forces on the James, Chickhominy
and Nansemond rivers. The regiment was mustered out of service at Fort Monroe on November 9, 1865.

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>This collection contains the diary of George H. Marshall, a soldier in Company K, 113th
Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery during the Civil War. The diary contains short entries spanning one
year, beginning with Marshall's enlistment on February 24, 1864. The diary's early entries cover
Marshall's enlistment and the movement of his regiment. Later entries, made from Fort Monroe,
Virginia, at which the 113th was stationed, relate to the daily routines of Marshall, his regiment,
and the fort. Marshall notes such details as the weather, the condition of his health, and his
correspondence but also makes mention of prisoners of war, African American troops, the wounded, and
skirmishes with the Confederates. </p>
