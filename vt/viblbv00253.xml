<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>"Cooking Recipes" is a book filled with hand-written recipes.  A hand-painted image of a girl with a duck adorns the cover of "Cooking Recipes."  Within the book's pages exist a variety of recipes for soups, salads, puddings, cookies, cakes, icings, and biscuits.  A personal note from "Helena" precedes the recipes.  In this note, "Helena" thanks the unknown receiver, "Girlie," for participating in her wedding.  "Helena" also reinforces the notion that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.  
</p>
<p>No information exists on the recipe book's time period or the geographic location from which it was produced.  From the book's appearance, one can surmise that it dates from around the 1930s.
