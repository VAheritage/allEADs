            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>Appomattox Iron Works was founded by Esek Steere and E. J. Armstrong in Petersburg, Virginia in 1872. The company operated an iron foundry, specializing in the manufacture of machinery for the peanut and tobacco industries. The company's products were sold throughout the United States, and its peanut shelling machines were sold in several foreign countries. Later, Appomattox Iron Works added sawmills to its list of products and also opened a machine shop for general repair work. In 1876, Steere and his son Albert bought out Armstrong's interest in the company. In 1910, the company added a mill supply department, and in 1916, it was incorporated as the Appomattox Iron Works and Supply Company. The company ceased operations in 1972.</p>

            <p>This collection contains business records of the Appomattox Iron Works and Supply Company, a Petersburg, Virginia manufacturer of machinery for the peanut, tobacco, and lumber industries. The collection contains correspondence, notes, and other records of the company's operations. The majority of the collection consists of correspondence regarding the credit risk of potential customers. These files contain both the company's inquiries to references supplied by customers and the responses of those references. The collection also contains files of correspondence and other papers relating in other ways to its customers. Many of the letters concern purchase authorizations and other routine matters relating to customer accounts. A file of general business papers completes the collection and includes account collection lists, notations, and forms. Also included is a letter providing a very brief history of the company to 1933.</p>
