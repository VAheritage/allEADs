      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains 35 letters written by Union private David Moser, 199th
        Pennsylvania Infantry, to his wife, Sarah, from various locations including Philadelphia,
        Dutch Gap, VA, Richmond, Burkville Station, and Appomattox Court House, dating from
        September 1864 through June 1865.</p>
      <p>Moser's letters detail many of the regiment's activities beginning at Camp Cadwalader in
        Philadelphia. From Dutch Gap, he described tunneling and canal work as well as picket duty,
        camp life, and activities near Petersburg. He spoke of dealing with hungry prisoners and,
        more importantly, his pursuit of Lee and engaging with his men at Appomattox. He also
        discusses the devastating effects of war on the citizens of Richmond and his sorrow over the
        assassination of his Commander in Chief. </p>
      <p> In addition to Moser's letters to his wife, the collection also includes an 1865 letter to
        her from her brother, soldier Edwin Rickert. There is also a check from 1912, a watch order
        from 1892, and a printed flyer from a 1917 Memorial Day flag raising ceremony in Scranton in
        which "Civil War Veteran D.W. Moser" is listed as raising the flag (he would have been 83
        years old at the time). </p>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>David Moser was born in Scranton, PA in 1834 and died in 1929. His wife, Sarah, was born in
        1840 and died in 1916. They lived all their married lives in Scranton and are both buried
        there. David Moser was Pennsylvanian German and spelled many of his words phonetically
        ("trink" for drink, "fide" for fight, "sing" for thing, "wis" for with, "blanty" for plenty,
        etc.).</p>
      <p>Late in the war, he mustered into the 199th Pennsylvania Regiment on September 24, 1864 and
        served until its end. His regiment originally mustered into service at Philadelphia in
        September and October of 1864 for one year. His regiment joined the Army of the James in
        October at deep Bottom Landing and was assigned to the 1st brigade, 1st division, 24th
        corps. The regiment saw little action, sometimes seeing dirt or dark tunnels more than they
        did the enemy. Heavy cannon fire reminded them that the enemy was still nearby. The regiment
        served trench duty there until March 1865 and participated in the Appomattox Campaign from
        March 28 to April 9, 1865. It shared in the final assault on the works of Petersburg April
        2, 1865, as a part of Foster's division, which captured Forts Gregg and Alexander. After the
        fall of Petersburg, it followed in pursuit of Lee's retreating army to Burkesville and
        thence to Appomattox, losing two killed and one wounded in the skirmish at Rice's station
        April 6, and two killed and eight wounded near Appomattox on April 9th. After Lee's final
        surrender the regiment moved to Richmond, where it mustered out on June 28, 1865. </p>
