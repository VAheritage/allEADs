      <p>Moses McClure Strong was born in Rutland, Vermont on May 20, 1810. After attending
        Middlebury and Dartmouth colleges, he studied law at Litchfield Law School and established a
        practice in Rutland. In 1836, Strong moved to Mineral Point, Wisconsin, and the following
        year, he was hired to survey Madison. In 1838, he was appointed the attorney and fiscal
        agent for Wisconsin Territory and represented Iowa County in the Wisconsin territorial
        legislative assembly from 1841 to 1846. In the latter year, he represented Iowa County in
        the first convention to draft a constitution for the proposed state of Wisconsin. Though
        this draft was ultimately rejected by the voters, Strong was elected to the new state's
        legislature in 1850. During his service in the legislature, Strong became an active promoter
        of the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad and was implicated in a bribery scandal that
        effectively ended his political career. During the 1870s, Strong wrote <title
          render="italic">History of the Territory of Wisconsin from 1836 to 1848</title>, published
        by the legislature in 1885. </p>
      <p>Moses M. Strong died in Mineral Point, Wisconsin on July 20, 1894.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a single letter written by Moses M. Strong, of Mineral Point,
        Wisconsin and addressed to C. W. Woodman of Dover, New Hampshire. The letter relates to
        Woodman's order of a copy of Strong's book (unnamed but almost certainly Strong's <title
          render="italic">History of the Territory of Wisconsin from 1836 to 1848</title>). Strong's
        letter also mentions mutual acquaintances at Dartmouth College.</p>
