      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>John Henry Johnson, a Southwest Virginia politician, farmer and businessman, was born in Turkey Cove (Lee County), Virginia on June 22, 1889. The son of John M. and Mannie Morrison Johnson, he attended school at Shoemaker College, Washington and Lee University and the University of Virginia. Johnson was appointed a Virginia delegate to the National Good Roads Congress in 1911. By 1914, Johnson was living in Scott County, from which he was elected as a Democrat to a single term in the Virginia House of Delegates. A farmer and businessman, Johnson also served in a number of local civic posts and managed the statewide campaign of Benjamin Franklin Buchanan in his race for lieutenant governor. During World War I, he was a "four-minute man," delivering short speeches--while reels were exchanged at film showings--in support of the war effort. In 1923, Johnson was elected to the Virginia Senate, representing the Sixteenth Senatorial District, composed of Lee and Scott counties. He also served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention the following year. Reelected to the state senate in 1925, Johnson lost his bid for a third term in 1927. John Henry Johnson died on September 27, 1956.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a scrapbook compiled by John Henry Johnson, a Southwest Virginia politician, farmer and businessman. The scrapbook includes such items as correspondence from other state and national figures, newspaper clippings, invitations, certificates, and other assorted ephemera. 
</p>
      <p>Among the political correspondents represented are William Jennings Bryan, Nebraska Governor Charles W. Bryan and other members of the Bryan family; Adlai Stevenson; Virginia Congressman Carter Glass; Democratic National Committee Chair Stephen A. Mitchell; Virginia Senator Thomas S. Martin; 1924 Democratic Party presidential nominee John W. Davis; Henry St. George Tucker, and former Virginia Lieutenant Governor Benjamin F. Buchanan.
</p>
      <p>Most of the newspaper clippings relate to local, state and national politics--including Virginia vote tabulations--and Johnson's own political career. Other clippings include a number of obituaries of Johnson's family members and acquaintances, as well as articles on Johnson's general personal interests, including various short poems (some written by Johnson); county, state and national history; and newsmakers of the day. Among the invitations are items relating to the fourth inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Included among the ephemera are a booklet of Washington and Lee songs, yells for a 1908 football game against Virginia Tech, and political handbills. The scrapbook contains a lone photograph, a studio portrait of Virginia Lieutenant Governor Benjamin F. Buchanan.
