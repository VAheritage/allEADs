      <abstract label="Abstract">The Pocahontas Mines Collection, 1883-1997, documents the mining
        operations of CONSOL Energy, Inc. and its predecessor coal mining companies in the
        Pocahontas, Virginia, area, including numerous counties in southwest Virginia and eastern
        West Virginia. The collection is divided into four series based on type: Scanned rolls,
        Unscanned rolls, Books, and Ledgers. The scanned and unscanned rolls are primarily of mining
        maps and related oversized items, such as mechanical building and equipment drawings, plats,
        and topographic maps. The books and ledgers generally relate to mining surveys.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Named for its proximity to Pocahontas, Virginia, and Great Flat Top Mountain in West
        Virginia, the Pocahontas Coalfield or Flat Top-Pocahontas Coalfield spans 900 square miles
        along the Virginia-West Virginia border. Discovered in the mid-1800s, local blacksmith
        Jordan Nelson started selling coal from his land in the 1860s. During the Civil War,
        Confederate cartographer Jedidiah Hotchkiss boasted about the coalfield in his publications
        and in 1876 exhibited at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition.</p>
      <p>In 1881, the town of Pocahontas, Virginia, was founded to support the mining operations,
        and two years later the first mine in the coalfield was opened to Pocahontas Seam #3. A
        number of competing mining and land companies developed in the 1880s around the Pocahontas
        Coalfield. Several Philadelphia businessmen joined forces to establish the Norfolk &amp;
        Western Railroad (later the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway) to transport coal out of the
        coalfield, the Flat Top Land Association to manage land holdings, and the Southwest Virginia
        Improvement Company to develop mining operations.</p>
      <p>The Flat Top Land Association (later Flat Top Land Company) leased land in the area to
        independent miners. John Cooper formed the Mill Creek Coal &amp; Coke Company in 1884, J.P.
        Bowen founded the Booth-Bowen Coal &amp; Coke Company, and William McQuail operated the
        Turkey Gap Coal &amp; Coke Company. Jenkin Jones began leasing from Flat Top in 1885. By
        1907, he established the Pocahontas Consolidated Collieries Company, Inc. of West Virginia,
        later Pocahontas Fuel Co., Inc., by merging numerous mining companies together.</p>
      <p>In 1901, J. P. Morgan of U. S. Steel acquired the Flat Top Land Company, reorganizing it
        into the Pocahontas Coal &amp; Coke Company of New Jersey, and the Southwest Virginia
        Improvement Company became the Pocahontas Fuel Company of New York. At this time, the
        Norfolk &amp; Western Railway purchased land from Morgan in a deal granting him acreage to
        form his United States Coal &amp; Coke Company at Gary, West Virginia. In 1939, Pocahontas
        Coal &amp; Coke became Pocahontas Land Corporation, chartered in Virginia, and in 1977, the
        company chartered the Pocahontas Kentucky Corporation, later the Pocahontas Development
        Corporation. In 1982, Norfolk &amp; Western merged with the Southern Railway as Norfolk
        Southern.</p>
      <p>In 1860, several Maryland coal operators merged their companies into the Consolidation Coal
        Company. The company began mining operations in West Virginia when it acquired the Fairmont
        Coal Company in 1903. After further expansion, Consolidation Coal merged with the Pittsburgh
        Coal Company into the Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Company in 1945. In 1956, the company
        acquired the Pocahontas Fuel Co., Inc., and in 1991, DuPont Energy and RWE A.G. acquired and
        changed the company's name to CONSOL Energy, Inc.</p>

      <p>The Pocahontas Mines Collection, 1883-1997, documents the mining operations of CONSOL
        Energy, Inc. and its predecessor coal mining companies in the Pocahontas, Virginia, area,
        including numerous counties in southwest Virginia and eastern West Virginia. </p>
      <p>The collection is divided into four series based on type: I. Scanned rolls, II. Unscanned
        rolls, III. Books, and IV. Ledgers. The scanned and unscanned rolls are primarily of mining
        maps and related oversized items, such as mechanical building and equipment drawings, plats,
        and topographic maps. The books and ledgers generally relate to mining surveys. </p>
      <p>Series I. Scanned rolls, 1891-1992, contain 3475 maps in 261 boxes, totaling approximately
        135 cu. ft. Most of these rolls are mining or mine survey maps, and when possible, the maps
        are identified with title, company, coalbed, mine name, county, state, USGS quadrangle,
        dates, and notes. Related scanned rolls are identified by CON number, and some related items
        are unscanned and identified in Series II. The items in this series have been scanned, and
        their digital file ids are the CON# (e.g. CON1_1 or CON3209) assigned by the DMME. Some maps
        also have OSM Doc, MSHA, and/or USBM numbers.</p>

      <p>Series II. Unscanned rolls, 1883-1997, contains 463 boxes, totaling approximately 360 cu.
        ft. Most rolls are mining and topo maps, mechanical and architectural drawings, and
        photographs that have not been scanned. Some rolls may be duplicates, very similar to, or of
        the same mine/area as scanned maps in Series I and are noted when possible by identifying
        the CON digital file number (e.g. "similar to CON2501" or "see also CON153").</p>
      <p>Series III. Books, 1914-1995, contains 2940 vols. in 62 boxes, totaling 64.48 cu. ft. It
        consists of mainly field notebooks from mine surveys and some related papers for surveys.
        There are publications in boxes B61 and B62.</p>
      <p>Series IV. Ledgers, 1916-1993, contains 42 boxes, totaling 45.02 cu. ft. It primarily
        consists of survey record books (not field notebooks). Many record "Survey By", "Traverse
        by", Notebook No., Page No., Station, Azimuth, Reduced Vernier, Cosine, Horizontal
        Distances, Sine, Latitude (North and South), Departure (East and West), Sums of Latitude
        (N&amp;S) and of Departure (E&amp;W), Remarks. <emph render="italic">N.B.:</emph> TT looks

          <p>Series II. Unscanned rolls, 1883-1997, contains 463 boxes, totalling approximately 360
            cu. ft. Most rolls are mining and topographical maps, mechanical and architectural
            drawings, and photographs that have not been scanned. Some rolls may be duplicates, very
            similar to, or of the same mine/area as scanned maps in Series I and are noted when
            possible by identifying the CON digital file number (e.g. "similar to CON2501" or "see
            also CON153").</p>
