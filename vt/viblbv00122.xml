      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Diana Balmori founded the design firm Balmori Associates,
         Inc. in 1990 and currently holds the position of Design
         Principal. She also holds an appointment at the Yale
         University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and
         was the partner for landscape at Cesar Pelli and Associates
         from 1984 to 1990. Balmori did her undergraduate work in
         architecture at the University of Tucuman in Argentina,
         received her Ph.D in Urban history with highest honors from
         the University of California, Los Angeles and studied
         landscape design at Radcliffe College.</p>
      <p>Balmori Associates was started primarily as a design firm
         with significant background and expertise in the design of
         landscapes. The firm's primary goal has been to combine
         artistic design with ecological principles. Balmori Associates
         has since then been able to adopt this design strategy to
         almost all their projects from the Prairie Waterway in
         Farmington, Minnesota to the landscape for 20 River Terrace in
         New York - the nation's first "Green" apartment building.
         Since founding the firm in 1990, Balmori Associates' work has
         been recognized in many publications and museum exhibits and
         has received many awards.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection consists of drawings, sketches, and
         presentation boards related to Balmori's work, with her firm
         Balmori Associates, on three landscape design projects.
         Projects include commissions for the courtyard design for the
         Humanities and Social Sciences Building at the University of
         California, Riverside, the master plan for Loring Park in
         Minneapolis, Minnesota and the courtyard and landscape design
         for the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University
         in New Jersey. All the projects were completed in the period
         from 1990 to 1996.</p>
