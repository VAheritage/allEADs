            <p>Joel H. Jenks was born about 1836 in Ohio and enlisted in the 78th Illinois Infantry
                in August 1862. He was mustered into the service as a private and was promoted to
                the rank of musician. His service record lists him as a farmer at the time of
                enlistment, but is reported as a jeweler the 1880 census. According to the
                Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois, Jenks also served as Kendall County surveyor
                from 1872-1879. He and his wife Olivia M. Jenks had one son, Frank. Both Joel and
                Olivia are listed in the 1910 census.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>This collection contains the Civil War dairy of Joel H. Jenks, 78th Illinois
                infantry, beginning January 1, 1865 through December 31, 1865. The diary does not
                contain battle descriptions, but does record the movements of the 78th Illinois during
                the Carolina campaign until early March, when Jenks is shipped out to a Hospital due
                to "Rheumatism." The diary often contains descriptions of the weather and "grub," as
                well as his own activities in camp or the hospital ward. Jenks continues the diary
                after the war, and describes waiting to be mustered, his return to his wife and
                family, and setting up Singing Schools in Plano, Il.</p>
            <p>Highlights of the diary include his reaction to the end of the war, President
                Lincoln's assassination, and his visitation of Lincoln's body while it lay in state
                in Columbus, OH.</p>
            <p>A transcript of the diary is available in the collection.</p>
