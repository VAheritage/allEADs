<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>Although the collection contains no specific personal identification information of the soldier in the photograph, a handwritten notation on the back of the photo indicates that the soldier may have been enlisted in the 45th regiment of the New York Infantry. The 45th regiment was organized in New York City, where it was recruited almost entirely of Germans, and mustered in the service of the United States for three years term commencing on September 9, 1861. On October 9, 1861 the regiment left camp at Jones' Wood for duty in defense of Washington, D. C and northern Virginia. The regiment fought in the battles of Cross Keys, Groveton, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Wauhatchie, Resaca, Dallas, New Hope Church, and Nashville. The regiment consolidated forces with the 58th regiment on June 30, 1865. During the term of service, the regiment lost 53 by death from wounds and 108 by death from other causes.
