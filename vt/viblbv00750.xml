            <p>Henry Brooke was an employee of the Spring Mt. Glendon and Mt. Carmel Collieries,
                Machine Shops and Foundry of Jeansville, Pennsylvania.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The collection contains a letter by Henry Brooke to Editor Colliery Engineer about an
                article written by Otto C. Burkhart, Professor of Mining Engineering at Virginia
                Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Virginia Tech), written in March 1893.
                Brooke also writes about telescopes used in surveying and mentions the inclusion of
                technical drawings, which are not included in the collection. There is also a New
                York watermark.</p>
            <p>Also, included in the collection is an Announcement for the School of Mines at
                Virginia Polytechnic Institute. The announcement contains a program of study, list
                of faculty, cost of attendance, and pictures of mining laboratories in. There is no
                date on the announcement. However, due to the list of faculty and the addition of a
                fifth year to the program of study in 1910-11 school year, which this announcement
                only has four years, the date is estimated between 1908 and 1910.</p>
