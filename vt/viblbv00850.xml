      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>David M. Davis was born in New York in 1843. He married Sarah E. Porter (born in 1842), the
        daughter of Henry N. and Helen Polson Porter. The 1870 census describes David Davis as a
        treasury clerk, residing in Washington, D.C. Also in the household are Sarah Davis and two
        children: Charles (five) and Helen (two). Washington newspapers of 1874-1875 contain notices
        under the name of D. M. Davis, advertising ties and boots for sale at his store, located at
        the corner of F and Twelfth streets. The Davis family is again listed as residents of
        Washington, D.C. in the 1880 census, with the addition of two younger children, Henry
        (eight) and David (three). (The record notes that all of the children had been born in
        Washington, with the exception of Helen, born in New York.) An 1897 newspaper account
        mentions that D. M. Davis, a Republican, had lost his job in the Bureau of Engraving to a
        political shakeup in 1893. Materials within this collection show that the Davises were
        living in Fauquier County, Virginia between 1895 and 1896, though it appears likely that the
        family maintained residences in both the capital and in Fauquier for a number of years.
        Sarah E. Davis is listed in the 1900 census as a 57-year-old widow living in Washington,
        D.C., with her three surviving children: Henry, 29; David, 23; and Helen, 32. The census
        again records Sarah Davis living with her family in Washington, D.C. in 1910. No further
        record could be found.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection contains a ledger maintained (at least in part) by David M. Davis of
        Fauquier County, Virginia. The ledger contains a number of different types of entries. The
        first section consists of a daybook, apparently for a clothing, shoe and accessories
        business opened by Davis at the corner of Washington D. C.'s F and 12th streets in January,
        1875. Over the course of several weeks, the entries detail sales of footwear, lace and other
        clothing goods. Beginning on March 3, 1875, the entries describe only general transactions,
        with no lists of goods purchased. These entries continue through November, 1875, perhaps
        indicating a settlement of the business's accounts. The account entries are followed by
        entries, apparently written in a different hand, detailing work performed by various farm
        laborers, together with wages paid in both cash and goods. Among the other items in the
        ledger's pages are a sharecropping agreement with William Brown, receipts, livestock
        records, and copies of letters.</p>
      <p>Also in the ledger is the daily journal of an unidentified individual, presumably a woman,
        perhaps Sarah E. Davis. The entries span July-October 1890, May-October 1891, and
        May-October 1892, indicating that these were the months that the family was present on the
        Fauquier County farm. In brief entries, the journal describes daily work on the house and
        farm, activities of family members, visitors, and weather.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains several loose documents that had been kept within the ledger.
        Among these are a sharecropping contract with J. W. Cubbage and an employment/poultry
        business contract with G. W. Bailey. Also included is a contract in which Davis agrees not
        to press trespassing charges against John Mann with the proviso that Mann will relinquish
        one of his horses to Davis should he be "detected in tresspassing [sic] and committing any
        unlawful act upon the property of said Davis..."</p>
