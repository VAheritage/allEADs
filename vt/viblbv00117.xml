      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The Hoge Family was one of the earliest settlers of the New
         River area of southwest Virginia. William Edward Hoge and his
         family resided in Point Pleasant, Bland County Virginia, where
         William Hoge began his medicinal practice in 1855. Hoge was
         married to Jane L. Meek, and they had three sons and one
         daughter.</p>
      <p>The Hoge family were all well educated and respected
         individuals in the community. In 1878, William Hoge assumed
         the responsibility of Sophia and Eugene Edmondson, his wife's
         niece and nephew. The Edmondsons lived in Memphis, Tennessee,
         at the time a town crippled by the yellow fever epidemic which
         took the lives of Sophia and Eugene's parents and brother
         Tommie. William Hoge travelled to Memphis and took the
         children under his care, concealing them under his buggy seat
         through the Memphis quarantine until he arrived in Broadford
         where their grandmother resided.</p>
      <p>William Hoge died on February 3, 1885, leaving his three
         sons land in Burke's Garden, Pulaski, and Bland County. His
         daughter Olivia (Ollie) inherited land in Abbs Valley near
         Pocahontas, Virginia which became a thriving territory for
         coal mining, leaving Ollie and her husband James S. Browning
         substantially wealthy.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Hoge Family papers consists of 164 letters and 65
         deeds, along with financial papers, postcards, and extensive
         genealogical research. The letters detail the lives of the
         Hoge family, specifically the children, from the 1830s through
         the 1880s. Several of the letters in the collection are
         written by Ollie Hoge, spanning from the time when she was a
         young girl enrolled in the Wytheville Female College to her
         later days as a wife and mother living in Richmond.</p>
      <p>Prevalent in the Hoge collection through all decades is the
         frequency of sickness and death. Word of a death in the family
         was sent out by postcard; commonly followed by a long,
         lamenting letter describing the lives of those lost in a
         beautifully poetic fashion.</p>
      <p>One of the most interesting parts to the collection is the
         letters written by the Hoge family during the time of the
         Civil War. The letters are from friends of the Hoge family
         letting them know they are seeking enlistment, and from both
         Confederate soldiers and Virginians who are terrified to see
         Union soldiers travelling through their land. One letter in
         the collection involves a vivid description from Caroline Meek
         Thomas describing Union soldiers who were camped in the
         Blacksburg area.</p>
      <p>Also included in the Hoge collection is genealogical
         material comprised by Dorothy Bodell. Material includes
         photocopied pictures of several southwest Virginia families
         and family trees from the Hoge, Meek, and Thomas families. In
         addition to Bodell's work, transcriptions and summaries of
         selected letters are included.</p>
