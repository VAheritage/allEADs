         <p>Ruby Bishop, Floyd County educator and local historian, was
         born near Falling Branch (Floyd County), Virginia, the only
         daughter of Wesley and Lydia Caldwell Bishop. When Bishop was
         still a child, the family moved to Floyd, where she graduated
         from Floyd Academy in 1920. (She later attended Radford
         College, obtaining a two-year degree in 1930, and a bachelor's
         degree in 1938.)</p>
         <p>In 1920, Bishop was hired to teach in a one-room school in
         Floyd County's Little River District. In 1925, she began
         teaching seventh grade at Floyd County High School, a post she
         would retain until 1940, when she was appointed elementary
         supervisor of the county's schools. She also served for a time
         as administrative assistant to the county's superintendent for
         instruction and as acting superintendent of Floyd County
         schools. Bishop married Judge George D. West (born April 19,
         1897) in 1957; she retired in 1967.</p>
         <p>Ruby Bishop West maintained an interest in local history
         throughout her life; she organized Floyd County's
         sesquicentennial celebration in 1981. She joined the Methodist
         Church in 1915, and was an active member, serving at various
         times as teacher and church historian. She died on May 8, 1984
         (her husband having died in 1975) and is buried in
         Jacksonville Cemetery, Floyd.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection contains the papers of Ruby Bishop West, an
         educator and local historian from Floyd, Virginia. The papers
         are divided into five series: Floyd County Churches, Floyd

         <p>Within the Floyd County Education Series are historical
         data, printed materials (mostly programs for school events)
         and photographs of various Floyd County schools. Much of the
         material centers on Floyd High School, but other schools are
         represented as well. The series also contains tabulations on
         county school enrollment, test scores and withdrawals during
         the 1930s and 1940s.</p>
         <p>The Floyd County History Series contains mostly research
         notes on various topics relating to Floyd County history,
         particularly the Civil War, genealogy, mining, and postal and
         telephone service. The series also includes historical
         sketches and data on the county's settlement and development
         and materials relating to the celebration of the county's
         centennial (1931) and sesquicentennial (1981).</p>
         <p>Items relating to West's personal life are found in the
         Personal Materials Series. The series includes West's
         diplomas, grade reports and other items from Radford Teacher's
         College, a small early twentieth century photo album, other
         assorted photos and ephemera, and a sizeable collection of
         sheet music.</p>
         <p>The Oversize Materials series consists of items which were
         too large to be inter-filed with their respective series. The
         series includes a large photo of Floyd Academy, a 1960 Floyd
         High School newspaper and oversized sheet music
         publications.</p>
