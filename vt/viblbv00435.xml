      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Dr. Harvey Black (1827-1888) was the great grandson of Samuel Black and grandson of John
        Black who were among the original settlers of Blacksburg, Virginia. He was born to Alexander
        and Elizabeth McDowell Black in 1827. He served as a private in the Mexican War. Following
        his discharge in 1848, he attended medical school at the University of Virginia, then set up
        a private practice in Blacksburg in 1850. In 1852, he married Mary Irby Kent (b. 1836), who
        he called "Mollie." They had four children: Kent (b.1853), Elizabeth (b.1855), Alexander
        (b.1957), and Charles (b.1859). </p>
      <p> During the Civil War, Black was a surgeon with the 4<emph render="super">th</emph>
        Regiment, Virginia Infantry, and ran the field hospital of the 2<emph render="super"
          >nd</emph> Corps, Army of Northern Virginia. Black assisted in the operation on General
        Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson after Jackson had been wounded at the Battle of
        Chancellorsville. </p>
      <p> After the Civil War, Harvey Black resumed his medical practice in Blacksburg. He was
        elected president of the Medical Society of Virginia in 1872. He played an instrumental role
        in the founding of the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College in Blacksburg in 1872.
        He was the first rector of the Board of Visitors.</p>
      <p> From 1876 to 1882, Harvey Black was Superintendent of the Eastern Lunatic Asylum in
        Williamsburg. In 1884, he was appointed to the board of a proposed state mental hospital for
        southwestern Virginia. In 1885, he was elected to represent Montgomery County in the House
        of Delegates and served two sessions. In the House, he influenced the decision to locate the
        new hospital in Marion. In 1887, Black became the first superintendent of the new
        Southwestern State Lunatic Asylum in Marion. He appointed John S. Apperson (who later
        married Black's daughter Elizabeth in 1889) assistant physician there. Harvey Black died in
        Richmond in October 1888 and was buried in Westview Cemetery in Blacksburg.</p>
      <p> William A. Wade was born in Virginia about 1827. He was a Methodist Episcopal minister.
        Some time around 1850, he married Charlotte (Charlette) Louisa (b. abt. 1830). They had
        three children: Elizabeth (b. abt.1851), Willie (b. abt.1862), and Allice (b. abt. 1864). In
        1860, the family lived in Blacksburg, possibly with Charlotte's extended family. In 1880,
        they were in Opequon, Frederick County, Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This medical bill is an itemized list of the services provided by Dr. Harvey Black to the
        family of Rev. William A. Wade between 1865 and 1867. Many of Black's visits were for Wade's
        wife and children, but the list also notes service to "negro woman Rachel." Black provided
        such services as cupping while also administering prescribed medicines, such as olive oil,
        rhubarb, chalk, and brandy. </p>
      <p>While the price of each service and/or prescribed medicine is listed and totaled, Black
        wrote the following at the end, dated 1879: "The Rev W.A. Wade being engaged in the active
        work of the ministry the above balance is hereby canceled. The bond of $36.39 named in his
        statement cannot be found. While it is probably among my papers at Blacksburg, its payment
        is hereby acknowledged."</p>
