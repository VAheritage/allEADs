<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Peter Francisco Weaver was born in Greensville County, Virginia on August 1, 1835. Weaver enlisted as a Confederate Sergeant with Company F of the 5th Battalion Virginia Infantry. He was captured by the Union Army near Poolesville, Maryland on September 11, 1862 and exchanged 16 days later for government officials and prominent citizens taken during the raid. On April 30, 1863, Weaver transferred to the 13th Regiment, Virginia Cavalry as Sergeant Major. Weaver survived the Civil War and went on to become the director of Farmer's Bank in Emporia, Virginia. Weaver also held a position on the Greensville County Board of Supervisors.  Weaver remained a respected member of the community until his death in January of 1907.
