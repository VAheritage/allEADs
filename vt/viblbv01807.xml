            <p>This collection consists of eight letters written by American author Sherwood
                Anderson (1876-1941) to Llewellyn Jones (1884-1961) between 1916 and 1924 with three
                undated (but likely from the same period). Jones was the literary editor for the
                Chicago Evening Post. The correspondence primarily discusses the reviews of
                Anderson's earlier works by Jones and other critics. Anderson and Jones appear to
                have also been friends and a number of the letters include queries about Jones' wife
                and personal updates on Anderson and his second wife, Tennessee Claflin Mitchell
                (1874-1929). In the "Contents List" below, items showing as "c." are the date from
                the postmark on the envelope. In these cases, the letters themselves did not have
                dates.</p>
            <p>Although Anderson never mentions specific titles, the 1916 letters refer to <title
                    render="italic">Windy McPherson's Son</title>. The note from April 1918 probably
                refers to Anderson's collection of poetry published that year, <title
                    render="italic">Mid-American Chants</title>. The letter dated only "October 3"
                was likely written in 1918, since records indicate that was the fall in which
                Anderson had Spanish influenza. He writes, "Have made the draft of a new novel and
                writen some fifty thousand words of it," probably referring to early work on the
                novel <title render="italic">Poor White</title>, which was published in 1920. This
                typed letter also describes a recent visit to Anderson by Carl Sandburg. The two
                letters from 1924 both include Anderson's comments on reviews of his 1923 novel,
                    <title render="italic">Many Marriages</title>.</p>
            <p>The collection also includes two undated letters, both of which can be placed in an
                approximate timeline. One was written from New York City. Although short, it
                mentions he will be there until the end of the year. This likely places the letter
                in in either late 1922 or 1923, during which time he was living there (before he
                moved to New Orleans with his third wife in 1924). The other undated letter laments
                that the reactions "I have seen, for the most part, [are] not intelligent criticism
                but long dissertations on someone’s notion of labor, writing, or intellectuality."
                This could place the letter in 1917, after the publication of Marching Men, which
                dealt with themes of labor issues and the intellectual figure in society.</p>
            <p>Transcripts of the letters are available in print with collection and online with the
                digitized copies.</p>

            <head>Biographical Information</head>
            <p>Sherwood Anderson (1876-1941) was born in the small town of Camden, Ohio to Irwin McClain
                Anderson (d.1919) and Emma Jane Smith (d.1895). While Anderson excelled as a student, he
                quit school at the age of 14 to help support his family, taking on a wide variety of jobs.
                After his mother’s death, he relocated to Chicago for the first time, working and taking a
                few night classes. He served briefly in Cuba during the Spanish-American War, but was sent
                there after combat had ended. A few months later, he returned to Clyde, then moved to
                Springfield, Ohio, in 1899, where he completed his senior year at Wittenburg Academy, a prep
                school. His graduation speech resulted in his being offered a job as an advertising
                solicitor and he moved to back to Chicago.</p>
            <p>In 1903, work travels took him to Toledo, Ohio, where he met Cornelia Pratt Lane, his first
                wife. The couple married in 1904 and had three children: Robert Lane (1907-1951), John
                Sherwood (1908-1995) and Marion (Mimi) (1911-1996). In 1906, they relocated to Cleveland
                when Anderson became the president of the United Factories Company, a mail-order firm. The
                following year he departed the company, took his family to Elyria, Ohio, and started the
                Anderson Manufacturing Co., another mail-order business.</p>
            <p>In 1912, Anderson suffered a nervous breakdown. He returned to Chicago yet again and began
                work writing advertising copy, as well as becoming part of the writer and artist scene of
                the city. In 1916, he divorced Cornelia Pratt and married Tennessee Mitchell, a sculptor. He
                also published his first novel, Windy McPherson’s Son, the first of three books in a deal
                with publisher John Lane. It was the beginning of his writing career. 1919 saw the
                publication of his short story collection, <title render="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title>, one of his most well-known
                works. In 1924, he divorced Tennessee Mitchell and married Elizabeth Prall. They lived in
                New York and New Orleans, and traveled in Europe. With profits from his 1925 novel Dark
                Laughter, Anderson bought Ripshin Farm, later just Ripshin, of Troutdale, Virginia, as a
                summer home in 1926. He also acquired both local newspapers, the <title render="italic">Smyth County News</title> and the
                <title render="italic">Marion Democrat</title>. His son, Robert, helped with, and eventually took over management of the
                newspapers in 1929. Around the same time, Anderson began a tour of the south and its factory
                towns with Eleanor Copenhaver, which shaped several of his later non-fiction
                publications.</p>
            <p>In 1932, Anderson divorced Elizabeth Prall and the following year, married Eleanor
                Copenhaver (1896-1985). Southwest Virginia was a powerful influence on his later stories and
                novels. His life in and around Marion and Troutdale was the focus of his writing for the
                newspapers, as well. At the same time, he was still writing novels and short stories for
                magazines. In 1941, Sherwood and Eleanor Anderson left for a trip to South America. During
                the trip, after ingesting a toothpick, Anderson developed peritonitis and was hospitalized
                in Panama, where he passed away on March 8, 1941. He is buried in Round Hill Cemetery in
                Marion, Virginia.</p>
            <p>Over his lifetime, Anderson published 8 novels, 4 collections of short stories, 2
                collections of poetry, 1 collection of plays, and 12 works of non-fiction. Following his
                death, publishers and scholars have produced memoirs, critical editions, and several volumes
                of his collected letters. During his life, he was influential on the careers of William
                Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway, and maintained extensive correspondence and friendships with
                authors, artists, publishers, and critics (though he later wrote that he had given up
                reading reviews).</p>
