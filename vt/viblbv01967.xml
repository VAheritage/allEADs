      <head>Biographical Note: Emilius A. Baughman</head>
      <p>Emilius Allen Baughman was born to George and Mary Jane (Greer) Baughman in 1844 in
        Maryland. The family relocated to Salem, Virginia, in 1847, and later to Richmond, in 1856.
        At the age of 18, in 1863, he followed his father and older brothers, and enlisted in the
        Confederate army with 38th Battalion, Virginia Light Artillery (Read's). His brother Greer
        was already a member of the unit. Following the Civil War, he and his brothers took over
        their father's stationary business, forming Baughman Bros. in Richmond. In 1873, Emilius
        married Mary Barney in Richmond, and the couple had 8 children. Emilius died in 1915 and is
        buried in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note: Greer H. Baughman</head>
      <p>Greer H. Baughman was born to George and Mary Jane (Greer) Baughman about 1840, in
        Maryland. The family relocated to Salem, Virginia, in 1847, and later to Richmond, in 1856.
        Greer enlisted with the 21st Regiment, Virginia Infantry (along with two of his brothers),
        in April of 1861. In July 1861, he transferred to the Hampden Artilley, with which his
        youngest brother would later enlist. Greer was wounded in June 1864 and spent over a month
        in the Confederate hospital at Chimborazo, before returning to his regiment for the
        remainder of the war. Greer married Francis H. (Willie) Richardson (b. 1845, d.before 1900)
        on August 15, 1866. They had one daughter, May (1868-1952). Following the Civil War, he and
        his brothers took over their father's stationary business, forming Baughman Bros. in
        Richmond. Greer died in 1907 and is buried in the Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond,
        Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection consists of seven letters written by brothers and Confederate soldiers,
        Greer and Emilius Baughman from locations in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia and the
        trenches around Petersburg, Virginia. Letters were written to family back home in Richmond
        between 1862 and 1865.</p>
      <p>Highlights include a letter written by Greer, September 14, 1862, near Winchester,
        Virginia, describing activities during the Maryland Campaign of 1862, which culminated with
        the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg) in Maryland, September 17, 1862. The letter describes
        Greer being left behind in Virginia while the Confederate army marched into Maryland, as
        well as his wish and anxiety to go into Maryland with the army. Several letters from Emilius
        written in late 1864 and 1865 from around Petersburg, Virginia, shed light into life within
        the Confederate lines. Of particular interest is the letter dated February 26, 1865 in which
        Baughman confidently writes his father " I do not think that the combined forces of Sherman
        and Grant can capture it [Richmond]."</p>
