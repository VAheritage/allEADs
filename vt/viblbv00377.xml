      <p>The Sullivan Railroad was incorporated in 1846. Completed in 1852, the line ran between the towns of Windsor and Bellows Falls, Vermont. To satisfy the company's debts, it was sold to bondholders in 1866 and reorganized as the Sullivan County Railroad, with the line leased for a succession of railroads. Sullivan County Railroad continued to operate as late as 1911.
