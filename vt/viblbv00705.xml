<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Squire Bosworth, the son of Joshua Bosworth, was born in Montgomery, Massachusetts in 1785. He moved with his family to what is northwestern Virginia (now West Virginia) while still young. After teaching school in Parkersburg and Beverly, Bosworth studied medicine under a Dr. Dolbear and established his practice in Beverly. He served for a time as Randolph County court clerk and as deputy sheriff and represented Randolph and Tucker counties in the Virginia General Assembly. Bosworth married Hannah Buckey (daughter of Peter Buckey) in 1816, and the couple would have ten children: John W., Squire N., George W., Elam B., Rebecca, Lucy, Harriet, Martha, Christina, and Mary. Squire Bosworth died in Beverly, West Virginia in 1870. His son, John W. Bosworth, would also become a physician. Another son, Squire N. Bosworth, served during the Civil War in Company F of the 31st Virginia Infantry. Following the war, Squire N. Bosworth married Florence A. Brown (daughter of Bernard L. Brown). He worked as a dry goods merchant and served for many years as Beverly's postmaster. Squire Newton Bosworth died in 1922.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection contains papers of Squire Bosworth, a physician and county court clerk of Randolph County, Virginia/West Virginia. The collection includes correspondence of Bosworth, other members of his family, and seemingly unrelated individuals. Included is an 1864 letter from Bosworth's son, Squire Newton Bosworth, of the 31st Virginia Infantry. Writing from the camp of Pegram's Brigade to an unidentified friend, Bosworth describes his regiment's marches and skirmishes with the enemy. He also mentions several women from Randolph County who have married Union soldiers, concluding, "I can't see how the girls of Randolph... can think of even countenancing men who are engaged in trying to destroy our country, &#038; subjugate their friends &#038; relations."</p>
<p>Also among the correspondence are several post-Civil War letters written by family and friends, discussing the political climate of the day in Virginia and West Virginia as well as Reconstruction issues in North Carolina and Virginia. The collection also contains a letter from Squire Bosworth filing a claim against the U. S. government for services he rendered as a physician during the war. An 1849 letter from E. D. Wilson of Philippi provides information on area politics and mentions the growing urbanization of Beverly, (West) Virginia. Also within the correspondence are several letters addressed to Bosworth in his capacity as Randolph County court clerk. 
</p>
<p>Among the legal papers in the collection is an 1848 bill of sale for a female slave named Huldah, purchased by Squire Bosworth from Peter Buckey. The collection also contains a summons ordering Squire Bosworth to appear before a local voter registration board to explain why his name should not be stricken from the local roll of voters. Also contained are deeds, marriage certificates, Bosworth's medical license, and a certificate granting local patent rights to a hillside plow improvement. The collection also contains several documents relating to attempts by John W. Bosworth, acting as the executor of his father's estate, to secure a claim against the U. S. government for goods confiscated by the army during the Civil War.
