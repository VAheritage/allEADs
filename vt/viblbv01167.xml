            <p>The Cocktail Ephemera Collection is a collection that was created in 2013. The collection consists of materials in a variety of formats relating to the history of the cocktails, dating from the about the 1870s to the present. Materials include advertising and promotional items; pamphlets with recipes and suggestions for entertaining (party games, themes, and more); and postcards. The focus of the collection is cocktails, but some materials also relate to wine and beer in their own right, as well as ingredients in mixed drinks.</p>

        <arrangement id="ref22">
            <head>Arrangement</head>
            <p>At its creation, the collection was established with three series: Advertising/Promotional Materials; Pamphlets; and Postcards. The Advertising/Promotional Materials and Pamphlet series are organized into three subseries each: Beer, Cocktails/Punch, and Wine. (<emph render="bold">Please note:</emph> Not all subseries contain items yet.) The Postcards series is arranged in alphabetical subseries based on cover images: Bars and Restaurants; Beers, Wines, and Liquor; Holidays; People and Scenery; Quotes and Text; and Recipes.</p>
            <p>Additional series and subseries are expected as the collection expands.</p>

                            <p>Tolu Rock and Rye appears to have a short history of distribution between 1880 and 1881 (possibly a little later) as a patent medicine.</p>
                            <p>Classification of the drink as a medicine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries made it easy for suppliers to avoid unwanted attention from the temperance movement and to avoid the taxes placed on alcohol at the time. As a medicine, rock and rye might be drunk straight, or mixed with hot tea. Recipes ranged from a basic mix of whisky and rock candy to more complex blends with citrus and herbs. Tolu Rock and Rye likely also contained tolu itself, a fragrant tree resin. Following Prohibition, Rock &amp; Rye continued to appear as a cocktail in bars and saloons.</p>
                            <p>This item suggests Tolu Rock and Rye was distributed by Donaldson Brothers, New York (likely among others). Contemporary newspapers and advertisements indicate this particular brand of "Tolu Rock and Rye" was a secondary company of Lawrence and Martin Company of Chicago. Rock and rye concoctions containing tolu were produced by several companies.</p>
