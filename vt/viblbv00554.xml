      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>The Huff and Hylton families settled in what is now Floyd County, but prior to 1831
                was Montgomery County, Virginia, in the late 1700s and early 1800s. The Huff family
                owned land on the west fork of the Little River.</p>
      <p>Lorenzo Dow Hylton was born on August 16, 1830, son of Burwell Hylton [Hilton] and
                Mary Ann Slusher. On July 23, 1857, he married Barbara Ellen Huff (1828-1911). The
                1860 Virginia census lists him as being a resident of Floyd County, age 29, his
                occupation as a machinist, worth $484.00. During the Civil War he enlisted in
                Company D of the 54th Virginia Infantry on March 24, 1862, in Abingdon, Virginia, as
                a 1st Lieutenant. He was wounded in action at Missionary Ridge, Tennessee,
                on November 25, 1863, and died in Marietta [Georgia] Hospital on February 13, 1864.
                He is buried in a Confederate cemetery in Marietta, Georgia. After Hylton's death
                his wife Barbara Ellen Huff Hylton married James Dillon [Dillion] and moved to
                Patrick County, Virginia.</p>
