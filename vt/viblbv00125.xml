      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Lois Davidson Gottlieb (1926-2018) was a residential designer based in San
                Francisco, California. She was born on November 13,1926 in San Francisco and
                attended Stanford University from 1944 to 1947, where she studied art and
                engineering and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. She served as an apprentice to
                famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright from 1948 to 1949 as part of the Taliesin
                Fellowship in Spring Green, Wisconsin and Scottsdale, Arizona. And she did her
                graduate work at Harvard University's School of Design from 1949 to 1950.</p>
      <p>Gottlieb began her career working as a designer for Warren Callister in San
                Francisco. Her first solo project was the design of the Val Goeschen house, a
                one-room unit with 576 square feet, in Inverness, CA. She went on to design other
                residences in Marin County as part of the design team Duncombe-Davidson based in
                Sausalito, CA. This partnership spanned the years 1951 to 1956. From 1956 to 2002,
                Gottlieb worked as a freelance residential designer on over 100 projects in the Bay
                Area and in Riverside, CA, as well as in Washington, Idaho, and Virginia.</p>
      <p>Gottlieb served as a lecturer at the College of the Holy Names in Oakland, CA from
                1960 to 1964, at Alameda State College in Hayward, CA from 1962 to 1964, and at the
                University of California Extension in Riverside, CA from 1966 to 1972. She also gave
                guest lectures at various universities around the world, including one at Virginia
                Tech in 1996.</p>
      <p>Gottlieb's work has been written about in many newspapers and periodicals, including
                    <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">House Beautiful</title> and the <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Marin County Independent Journal</title>. She has also published several works
                of her own, including <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Environment and Design in
                    Housing</title> (a book which was based on her lectures for a course of the same
                name and was published in 1966) and <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Way of Life: An
                    Apprenticeship with Frank Lloyd Wright</title> (which was based on the traveling
                exhibit of her photographs of Taliesin). Gottlieb's work has also been exhibited in
                institutions across the country, including a one-woman architectural exhibit at
                Virginia Tech in 1998 and the exhibit of photographs of Taliesin in2000-2001.</p>
      <p>From 1995 to 1996, Gottlieb designed and supervised the construction of an 11,000 sq.
                ft. home and office complex for her son, Mark Gottlieb, and his family in Fairfax
                Station, Virginia. She also produced a video, "Building a Dream: A Family Affair,"
                which documents her work on the project.</p>
