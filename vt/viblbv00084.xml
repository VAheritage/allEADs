      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Earl Palmer, an Appalachian photographer, was born in Bell
         County (some sources claim Harlan County), Kentucky, on May
         11, 1905. The son of traveling circus performers, Palmer's
         interest in photography began when he received a camera as a
         gift at age 7. After high school, Palmer took a job with a
         local A&amp;P grocery store. By the time he was 19, Palmer was
         managing the store and was soon employed by A&amp;P as a road
         supervisor, overseeing 18 stores. Meanwhile, his photos were
         appearing in local newspapers and were soon being seen in
         numerous travel magazines.</p>
      <p>Around 1945, Palmer moved with his first wife, Alice, to
         Cambria, Virginia (now part of Christiansburg), where he
         opened a grocery store. By this time, Palmer's photos were
         being featured in such magazines as 
         <title render="italic">Life,</title><title render="italic">National Geographic,</title> and the 
         <title render="italic">Saturday Evening Post.</title> Billing
         himself the 
         "Blue Ridge Mountains' Roamin'
         Camera Man", Palmer concentrated on the people and
         places of Appalachia, particularly the region's traditional
         culture. Though based in southwestern Virginia, Palmer
         traveled the mountain regions of Tennessee, North Carolina,
         Kentucky and West Virginia in search of subjects.</p>
      <p>By 1954, Palmer had been elected mayor of Cambria, and he
         would serve in that capacity until the town's merger with
         Christiansburg in 1964. In 1972, he retired from the grocery
         business to devote more time to photography. During his many
         trips, Palmer also collected a number of artifacts associated
         with traditional mountain life, including wagon wheels,
         handicrafts, a moonshine still and tools.</p>
      <p>In 1982, Palmer married Evelyn Chrisman; he died at his
         home on March 4, 1996.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection contains the photographs of Earl Palmer, an
         award-winning photographer from Cambria, Virginia, whose work
         depicted the landscape and traditional culture of rural
         Appalachia in Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia
         and West Virginia. The collection is divided among the
         following series: Photographs, Duplicate Photographs, Written
         Materials, and Oversize Photographs.</p>
        </scopecontent>
    <arrangement>
      <head>Arrangement</head>
	<p>The collection is divided among the following series:</p>
      <p>Series I, Photographs. Palmer's photographs
         span the 1940s to the 1970s and document the landscape and traditional culture of
         Appalachia in the Virginia- Tennessee-North Carolina-Kentucky-West Virginia region,  depicting artisans, moonshiners, coal miners and scenes from daily life in rural Appalachia. Many of the photos are accompanied by descriptions written by Palmer. The photographs (approximately 750) are arranged by topic, with numerous cross-references directing the user to appropriate subject headings.</p>
      <p>Series II, Duplicate Photos. Duplicate copies of those photos
         found in Series I, these photos are also arranged alphabetically by the same headings used in
         describing the original photos. Note that while there are multiple copies of some photos, there are no duplicate copies of others</p>

      <p>Series III, Written Materials. This series includes a small set of
         papers related to Palmer's photographic work and includes
         photo blurbs, correspondence and notes, postcards and
         other printed material. Arranged by document type.</p>

      <p>Series IV, Oversize Materials. This series contains photos which
         were too large to be filed with those in the Photographs
         series. It contains four images.</p>

      <p>Series V, Artifacts. The Artifacts Series contains materials,
         collected by Palmer, that are associated with traditional
         Appalachian folk culture. The series includes such items as a
         moonshine still, wagon wheels, ox yokes and hand-made brooms,
         as well as items associated with coal mining and railroading.
         Also included is a small collection of cameras and photography
         equipment. [Note: Except where otherwise noted within the contents list by the presence of a box-item location, the materials in this series are currently held by the university's Appalachian Studies Program and are housed in Solitude. While the material descriptions are arranged by subject matter in this guide, the items themselves are not so arranged.]</p>
