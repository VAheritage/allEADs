      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>The Roanoke and Southern Railway Company was formed in 1887, through the consolidation of the Roanoke and Southern Railway Company of Virginia and the Roanoke and Southern Railway Company of North Carolina. The company was to construct a rail line from Roanoke, Virginia southward through North Carolina to the South Carolina state line. The road opened for traffic from Winston-Salem, North Carolina to Martinsville, Virginia in 1891 and to Roanoke the following year. Beginning in March 1892, the company leased its railroad, property and franchises to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, which operated the 122-mile line as its Winston-Salem Division. The Roanoke and Southern's mortgage fell into foreclosure, however, and the company's property was sold at auction in 1896. The new owners reorganized the company as the Norfolk, Roanoke and Southern Railroad Company, with the line again leased to Norfolk &amp; Western.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a flyer containing the text of a piece of legislation amending the charter of the Roanoke and Southern Railway Company. Ratified by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1893, the amendment gives the company the power to lease and sell its property and to enter into mergers and consolidations with other lines, "provided, however, that no power herein contained shall authorize any lease, sale, consolidation or merger with any company owning, operating or controlling a competing line." The amendment also reserves state court jurisdiction over any legal actions which may arise.
