      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Willis A. Babcock enlisted as a private with Company B of the 10<emph render="super">th</emph> Regiment, New York Heavy Artillery on December 8, 1862 (he notes his
                19-month anniversary in his diary on March 8, 1864). He was probably born around
                1840 and was living in Adams, Jefferson County, New York, prior to the Civil War.
                During November and December of 1864, Babcock was on a furlough which was extended
                from its initial 12 days to an additional 18 days. He spent it at home in New York. The
                memorandum section of the diary notes extended furlough pay in December. He appears
                to have mustered out as a corporal, but it is unclear if this occurred with the
                regiment or prior to the end of the war. There is no information about his life
                after the war.</p>
      <p>The various companies of the 10<emph render="super">th</emph> Regiment, New York
                Heavy Artillery were formed during the fall and winter of 1862. By June of 1863 the
                entire regiment was stationed in Washington, D.C. The regiment remained there until
                May 1864, when it moved to Cold Harbor, Virginia. The unit fought at a number of
                significant battles in Virginia, including Cold Harbor, a portion of the Petersburg
                campaign, and Cedar Creek in the Shenandoah Valley. In December 1864, the regiment
                moved again and was stationed at Bermuda Hundred, Virginia, until joining the
                Appomattox Campaign in March 1865, and the final battle at Petersburg in April. The
                    10<emph render="super">th</emph> Regiment, New York Heavy Artillery mustered out
                in June of 1865.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>Babcock's Civil War diary begins near Washington, D.C., where his company had been
                since June 1863. While at Fort Carroll, his entries largely contain descriptions of
                his duties in camp (drills and guard, police, or orderly duties), as well as rare
                sight-seeing trips in the city. He occasionally mentions his meals, recording one
                day in March where he had roast turkey for dinner--several of his friends caught
                seven turkeys the previous day. Like many soldiers, Babcock frequently records the
                weather in his diary. In May of 1864, the artillery unit moved to Fort Willard,
                Virginia. For most of that month, Babcock's diary continues to record picket and
                guard duties, as well as inspections and dress parades. On May 27, the regiment
                marched to Washington and loaded on to boats headed down the Potomac River. He spent
                several days on board the U.S. Transport <emph render="italic">Jefferson</emph>
                before marching from Port Royal to Bowling Green, Virginia.</p>
      <p>In early June, the regiment was encamped at General Burnside's Headquarters near Cold
                Harbor, Virginia. On June 5, 1864, Babcock writes they were being shelled, which
                resulting in the "killing [of] one man from Co. K....+ one from Co. M. was
                wounded. this is the first time we have been under fire." He records
                several days of shelling before moving toward Petersburg. For most of June, July,
                and into August, Babcock's diary includes lengthy entries of his experiences from
                the rifle pits in Petersburg, as well as camp life. On July 30, he writes
                "losses very heavy on both sides our men occupy the same ground they did
                this morning. a total failure on our side." By mid-August, the 10<emph render="super">th</emph> New York Heavy Artillery was camped at Fort Whipple, in
                Arlington, Virginia.</p>
      <p>In early September, Babcock's entries find him increasingly ill and excused from
                duty. The regiment left for the Shenandaoh Valley in October and on October 8,
                Babcock writes, "slept in Hospital to night for the first time since I have
                been a soldier." He was transferred from Alexandria to Lincoln Hospital in
                Washington, D.C., where he remained until November. His entries for October are very
                brief. From November 6 to the end of the year, Babcock's diary is about his activities at
                home while on furlough.</p>
