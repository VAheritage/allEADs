            <head>Biographical Information</head>
            <p>Atwell W. Robertson was probably born between 1833 and 1836, according to various census and marriage records. In December 1855, he married Pattie A. Jennings (the 1860 census lists his spouse as Martha A. Robertson and it is unclear if this is the same woman). In June 1861, he enlisted with the Nottoway Light Artillery. By February 1862, he was a 1st Sergeant; in May of that year, he was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant. Atwell was AWOL from his regiment for the month of June (shortly before the letter was written, which apparently included a resignation), but he appears to have been back with the artillery a short time later. He was recorded as missing and wounded in action near Atlanta, Georgia, in July of 1864, but was eventually found and sent to the hospital at Forsythe, Georgia, where he died on August 23, 1864. His name appears on the Confederate monument at Nottoway Court House, Virginia.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The collection includes a letter from Atwell W. Robertson to Captain William C. Jeffress, written from Jenning's Ordinary, Virginia (Nottoway County) in July 1863. The majority of the letter includes news from home about Robertson's family, common friends, and information about local farming. In the middle, however, Robertson makes reference to his absence from the regiment, noting "I told my wife the other day that I was going back in service she said if I did go back she was going to write to you to send me back home Capt if it was not for my wife and children I would be with you now. I cannot leave my wife and children any more." A few lines later he writes "Enclose you will find my resignation." Robertson also added a post script which reads, "If the resignation will not do, alter it so it will do[.]"</p>
            <p>In June of 1863, Robertson was noted as AWOL, though from the letter, it appears he intended to resign. The collection does not include the resignation and based on regimental records, it was likely not accepted, since Robertson was back with his regiment a short time later. The letter ends with Robertson sharing news about the war and suggesting he intends to visit the regiment in the future, if possible.</p>
