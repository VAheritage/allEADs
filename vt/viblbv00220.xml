      <head>Biographical Information </head>
      <p>James Hoge Tyler, Virginia governor from 1898 to 1902, was born at the Tyler family
				farm, "Blenheim," in Caroline County, Virginia on August 11, 1846. He was the son of
				George Tyler (1817-1889), a representative of Caroline County, and Eliza Hoge
				(1815-1846), daughter of General James Hoge. His mother having died during his
				birth, the young James Hoge Tyler was reared by his grandparents, James and Eleanor
				Howe Hoge at "Hayfield," their Pulaski County home. Tyler was educated in Pulaski
				County before attending the school of Franklin Minor in Albermarle County. </p>
      <p>(George Tyler (1817-1889), father of James H., married four times: First to Jane De
				Jarnette (1820-1841)--the couple's only child died in childhood. Eliza Hoge
				(1815-1846) was Tyler's second wife, the future governor being their only child.
				Tyler married third Jane Quisenberry. The couple had two children: George William
				Tyler (married Mary Stuart Carter) and Nannie Brown Tyler (married John Washington).
				By his fourth wife, Julia Magruder (1837-1873), Tyler fathered six children: Henry
				Magruder Tyler, Mary Adams Taylor, Julia Magruder Tyler (married James Armistead
				Otey), Lucinda Coleman Tyler, Evelyn Tyler (married John J. Miller), John Tyler and
				William Elliot (married Burnley Redd).)</p>
      <p>Tyler left school at the age of 16 to join the Confederate army and served as a
				private in the Signal Corps throughout the Civil War. (His later rank of "major" was
				apparently a post-war honorific.) After the war, Tyler returned to Pulaski County,
				where he had inherited the Hoge farm. He would rename the farm "Belle Hampton" and
				become a successful farmer, raising Durham cattle and serving as president of the
				Virginia Stock Farmers' Institute and of the Southwest Virginia Live Stock
				Association. His other business interests would come to include a store, a
				gristmill, a sawmill, the Belle Hampton Coal Mining Company (sold in 1902 to a New
				York company), and the Radford Development Company. </p>
      <p>Tyler married Sue Montgomery Hammet (daughter of Edward and Clementina Craig Hammet,
				who built the first home in what is now Radford, Virginia), a native of Radford, on
				November 16, 1868. While living at Belle Hampton, the Tylers had eight children:
				Edward H., James H. Jr., Stockton H., Lucy Belle, Sue H., Henry C. ("Hal"), Eliza
				("Lily") and Eleanor Howe, who died in infancy. In 1891, the family moved to
				"Halwick," their home in Radford.</p>
      <p>In 1877, Tyler was elected to the state senate, serving one term and advocating
				retrenchment and reform. He maintained an active role in civic affairs, serving on
				the board of visitors and as rector of the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical
				College (now Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) and on the state
				debt commission. During the 1880s, he mounted two unsuccessful congressional
				campaigns. Tyler also launched an unsuccessful bid for governor in 1889 but secured
				the second place on the Democratic ticket that year and served as lieutenant
				governor from 1890 to 1894. While serving as lieutenant governor, Tyler again ran
				for the governorship in 1893, losing to Charles T. O'Ferrall. In 1897, Tyler
				successfully campaigned for governor and served from 1898 to 1902.</p>
      <p>Tyler's gubernatorial administration was marked by a concern with adjustment of
				Virginia's state debt. He was a strong supporter of bi-metallism, and was a personal
				friend of William Jennings Bryan. The American Historical Society's <title  render="italic">History of Virginia</title> (1926) summarized Tyler's
				governorship thus: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Governor Tyler's administration was marked by the settlement of the long vexed
					oyster question, for it was largely through his efforts that the LeCato bill was
					made effective and the oyster beds of the state made to yield an income to the
					state instead of an annual deficit. As governor he secured the reduction of
					taxes and the state debt and the increase of the public school fund and the
					literary fund. Other measures credited to his administration are the
					establishment of the Farm Bureau, the reorganization of the agricultural
					department, a conditional pardon system and the settlement of the
					Virginia-Tennessee boundary question.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>While serving as governor, Tyler launched an unsuccessful campaign for the U. S.
				Senate seat of incumbent Thomas S. Martin. His unsuccessful 1899 campaign would be
				Tyler's last, though he would continue to be somewhat active in state politics,
				playing the role of elder statesman and considering various pleas that he again seek
				office. During World War I, he served as food administrator for Radford and
				Montgomery County.</p>
      <p>A Presbyterian, Tyler served as a ruling elder and moderator of the Synod of
				Virginia. He founded the Presbyterian church in East Radford, the area's first brick
				church. Three times he represented his church in the Presbyterian General Assembly.
				He also served twice as a delegate to the Pan-Presbyterian Council--once in Toronto,
				Canada and once in Glasgow, Scotland. He also served on the boards of trustees of
				the church-affiliated Hampden-Sidney College, Union Theological Seminary, and
				Synodical Orphans Home at Lynchburg. </p>
      <p>James Hoge Tyler died on January 3, 1925; Sue Hammet Tyler, born July 16, 1845, died
				on April 24, 1927.</p>
      <p>Eldest child of James H. and Sue Hammet Tyler, Edward Hammet ("Ned") Tyler was born
				on December 15, 1869. He graduated from Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College
				(now Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) and served in Radford's
				local defense regiment, the Radford Rifles, during the late 19th century. Tyler
				remained a bachelor throughout his life and managed the family farm at Belle Hampton
				and also owned Kirkland Farm near Dublin (Pulaski County, Virginia). He died on
				March 22, 1939 in Radford. </p>
      <p>James Hoge Tyler Jr. was born on December 8, 1871. He attended Virginia Agricultural
				and Mechanical College and graduated from Hampden-Sidney College, where he was a
				member of the Sigma Sigma chapter of Sigma Chi fraternity. He worked in the
				governor's office during his father's administration and later for the
				Virginia-Carolina Chemical Company. He married Evelyn Gray Bell (daughter of A. O.
				Bell) on June 23, 1908, and the couple lived in Roanoke. The Tylers had no children.
				Evelyn died in Wilmington (Fluvanna County), Virginia around 1924. At the time of
				his wife's death, Tyler was living in Radford, paralyzed by a stroke; he died in
				1937. </p>
      <p>Born on September 13, 1874, Stockton Heth Tyler was a graduate of the Washington and
				Lee School of Law. During the Spanish-American War, he was a major in the U. S.
				Army, serving as an additional paymaster. He married Nelle Louise Serpell (born June
				10, 1878) on November 16, 1904; the couple had five children: Goldsborough Serpell,
				James Hoge III, Sue Hammet, Nell Serpell, Stockton Jr., and Gulielma Serpell. Tyler
				served as mayor of Norfolk, Virginia from 1924 to 1932. He died on September 5,
				1943.</p>
      <p>Lucy Belle Norwood Tyler was born March 9, 1876. She married Colonel Frank Percy
				McConnell (born July 1, 1870) of Talladega, Alabama on November 16, 1908. The
				couple, with their son, James Hoge Tyler McConnell, lived initially in Fort Smith,
				Arkansas, where McConnell was engaged in several business enterprises (including a
				Bonanza, Arkansas newspaper), before returning by 1927 to Radford. The son of
				Confederate Colonel William Kennedy McConnell, Frank McConnell commanded the Alabama
				National Guard's Third Regiment for four years. He was also an active member of
				Kappa Alpha fraternity, serving as general purser. Frank McConnell died on September
				21, 1941; Lucy Belle McConnell on February 4, 1955.</p>
      <p>Sue Hampton Tyler was born April 9, 1877. She married Rev. Robert Ware Jopling
				(1865-1944), a Presbyterian minister, on December 16, 1915. The couple had two
				children, Sue Tyler and James Robert (1918-1920), and they resided in Texas and
				South Carolina. Following her husband's death, Sue Jopling made her home in Norfolk,
				Virginia, where she died in 1949.</p>
      <p>Henry Clement ("Hal") Tyler was born in Pulaski County, Virginia on December 10,
				1878. He attended St. Alban's Academy in Radford and Richmond College before
				graduating from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1901. Admitted to the
				Virginia bar that same year, Tyler returned to Radford, where he established a law
				practice. In 1906, Tyler was appointed Radford's commonwealth attorney. He continued
				in that position through successive elections until 1922. In 1909, he was elected
				city attorney and served in that position until his death. In private practice,
				Tyler generally handled corporate law, including the legal affairs of the Belle
				Hampton Coal Company. Tyler also engaged in other businesses, being president of the
				Radford Hotel Corporation and the Radford Real Estate and Development Company. A
				Democrat, he served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1924 to 1925 and on the
				Radford School Board. He was a member of the American, Virginia and several county
				bar associations; Phi Delta Phi; Kappa Sigma; and Radford's rotary and golf clubs.
				He was also a superintendent of the Old Brick Presbyterian Church in Radford and
				later an elder in Radford's Central Presbyterian Church. Unmarried, Tyler died in
				Radford on December 1, 1941.</p>
      <p>Known to her family and friends as "Lily," Eliza Tyler was born on
				September 7, 1882; she married Henry Harrison Wilson (born January 15, 1882) on June
				16, 1915. The couple eventually made their home in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and had
				three children: James Hoge Tyler, Lily Norwood and Henry Harrison, Jr. Born in
				Cumberland County, Virginia on January 15, 1882, Wilson graduated from Virginia
				Polytechnic Institute and State University in 1906 with a BS in engineering. He
				served as an instructor in civil engineering at the university while earning a civil
				engineering degree the following year. Wilson worked on various projects before
				being employed from 1908 to 1911 by Winston &amp; Company, contractors for the
				Ashokan dams in New York. In 1914, he became a special partner in the company's
				highway and railway construction and in operation of its crushed stone business.
				Specializing in bridge and other construction work, Wilson became managing partner
				in 1925 of Winston Brothers Company &amp; H. H. Wilson. He was also president and
				treasurer of the Lime Bluff Company, director of All States Life Insurance and the
				Peoples Bank of Radford, Virginia. He was elected president of the Associated
				Pennsylvania Constructors in 1924 and vice-president of the Association of General
				Contractors of America in 1922. A member of the American Society of Civil Engineers,
				Wilson published several articles on highway construction and edited <title  render="italic">Highway Builder</title>. A descendant of Declaration of
				Independence signer Benjamin Harrison, Wilson maintained an interest in genealogy.
				He died in Baltimore, Maryland on May 31, 1933. Following his death, Lily Wilson
				returned to Virginia and by 1948 was living at the Tyler family home. </p>
      <p>Colonel Edward Hammet was the father of Sue Hammet Tyler. Arriving in the area of
				what is now Radford, Virginia in the 1830s, Hammet married Clementina Craig, who had
				inherited the Norwood property, near (or on) what is now Radford University, from
				her father, James Craig. Edward and Clementina had several children, including James
				Preston, Isabella (married Stockton Heth), John Radford, and Susan (married James
				Hoge Tyler). The Hammets maintained ownership of lands in Washington and Issaquena
				counties, Mississippi.</p>
      <p>William Henry Hammet / Hammett (1799-1865), brother of Edward Hammet, was born in
				County Cork, Ireland. He served as chaplain of the University of Virginia
				(1832-1834) and the Virginia House of Delegates before moving to Princeton,
				Mississippi. In 1837, he married the widow of Dr. James Metcalfe and became owner of
				the Lammermoor plantation. A Democrat, Hammet served in Congress from 1843-1845.
				Evidence within the collection suggests that Hammet was a physician. He died in
				Washington County, Mississippi and was buried on Lammermoor Plantation.</p>
      <p>James Preston Hammet (1832-1879), son of Edward Hammet and a graduate of Virginia
				Military Institute (class of 1853) studied medicine at the University of Virginia
				and in Philadelphia. He married Katherine Markham Spiller in 1856; their daughter
				would marry Judge G. E. Cassel of Radford, Virginia. At the commencement of the
				Civil War, Hammet organized the "New River Grays," which became Company H, 24th
				Virginia Infantry, but resigned early in the war. By 1864, he was a Montgomery
				County, Virginia surgeon, serving on the county's committee of public safety.</p>
      <p>Isabella Hammet ("Belle") Heth, daughter of Edward and Clementina Craig Hammet, was
				born in 1842. She married Captain Stockton Heth, who had served in the 18th Virginia
				Infantry. Heth, president of the Exchange Bank of Radford, also owned Whitethorne
				Plantation in Montgomery County, Virginia. The couple's children included Virginia
				C., Stockton Jr., Sally P., and Sue H. Isabella died in 1910 and is buried in
				Radford, Virginia. </p>
      <p>Very little information could be found on the Sifford family, and it remains unclear
				why the family's papers were within those of the Tylers. The Siffords were Pulaski
				County farmers, so it may be assumed there was a relationship with the Hoge family.
				In 1818, Harman Sifford and John Hoge purchased from Cornelius Brown lands on Back
				and Neck creeks. George W. H. Sifford, perhaps the son of Harman Sifford, married
				Elizabeth Loukes on September 8, 1838, and the couple had four children: Henry,
				Rufus, Joseph, and Mary. During the Civil War, Sifford served in the 4th Regiment of
				the Virginia Reserves, probably in Company C, the Pulaski Reserves. Several other
				family members also seem to have served in the Confederate Army, including Henry S.
				and Joseph (sons of George W. H.), who both served in the 54th Virginia
				Infantry.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>This collection contains the papers of James Hoge Tyler, Virginia state senator
				(1877-1879), lieutenant governor (1890-1894), governor (1898-1902), businessman,
				church elder, genealogist, and resident of Radford, Virginia. The collection
				includes Tyler's correspondence as governor, including a set of bound letter books.
				Also among the political correspondence are a set of subject files, largely relating
				to political appointments directly under the governor's control but also touching on
				some of the issues with which Tyler's administration was concerned. Complementing
				this official correspondence is a voluminous collection of incoming political
				correspondence, spanning the latter 19th and early 20th centuries, much of it
				devoted to Tyler's 1897 and 1899 campaigns, but also including references to the
				political atmosphere in Virginia and the national political issues of the day. </p>
      <p>Within Tyler's personal papers are files relating to his involvement in the
				Presbyterian Church, particularly his service on the boards of various
				church-related institutions and in various church councils, as well as his
				leadership in Radford's Presbyterian Church. Tyler's interest in genealogy is
				documented in a small set of correspondence from other researchers, together with
				two of his own typescript manuscripts and printed materials. Also within the
				personal papers is a large collection of incoming correspondence to both J. Hoge and
				Sue Hammet Tyler. Much of this correspondence is from members of his very large
				extended Hoge and Tyler families and relates to personal matters, though many of the
				letters also touch on political and business matters. Though housed among the
				personal papers, a collection of scrapbooks provides an exhaustive chronicle of
				Tyler's political career, largely through newspaper clippings.</p>
      <p>Tyler's business pursuits are well documented in a collection of correspondence,
				ledgers, and legal papers. Among these records are those of the Belle Hampton Coal
				Company and the Radford Development Company, together with records of Tyler's
				agricultural interests. Also among the business papers are documents relating to
				Tyler's personal financial activities, including such routine documents as personal
				checks and receipts.</p>
      <p>Of the papers of Tyler's children, perhaps the most significant are those of Stockton
				Heth Tyler, an army paymaster during the Spanish-American War. In addition to S.
				Heth Tyler's personal papers are paymaster records which he retained after the war.
				The papers include payroll records for a number of units and individuals.</p>
      <p>Also among the papers of Tyler's children are those of Edward H. Tyler, a Pulaski
				County, Virginia farmer; Belle Tyler McConnell, whose husband, Frank, was a
				prominent banker and businessman of Arkansas and Virginia; and Lily Tyler Wilson,
				whose husband, Henry, was a civil engineer and road contractor in Pennsylvania. </p>
      <p>The collection also includes the papers of members of the Hammet family of
				Mississippi and Virginia. Among these papers are a number of items relating to the
				affairs of Lammermoor Plantation in Mississippi, including materials concerning the
				ante bellum operation of the plantation, and later, accounts with the freedmen
				employed there. Also included among the Hammet papers are the account books of James
				P. Hammet, a physician of Montgomery County, Virginia.</p>
      <p>A small collection of papers belonging to the Sifford family of Pulaski County,
				Virginia, are included as well and relate to the family's personal activities and
				business/legal interests. Included among the papers is a small notebook providing
				the names and birth dates of slaves on an unidentified farm.</p>
      <p>Completing the collection is a large collection of photos, including both studio
				portraits and snapshots of the Tylers, extended family members and friends.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement encodinganalog="351">
      <head>Arrangement </head>
      <p>The collection is arranged in the following thirteen series: </p>
      <p>SERIES I: POLITICAL PAPERS, 1859-1923. This series contains the political papers of
				J. Hoge Tyler. The materials relate to Tyler's political career, his term as
				Virginia governor, and state and national politics of the late 19th and early 20th
				centuries. The series contains correspondence, speech texts, and printed materials.
				Obviously, Tyler's political and private life were not completely segregated, so
				within the political correspondence may be found many references to personal and
				business affairs (conversely, one may of course also find references to political
				affairs within Tyler's personal and business correspondence). This series is divided
				among the following eight subseries:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Subseries A: Executive Letter Books, 1898-1901. This subseries contains a
					compiled, bound set of Tyler's correspondence as governor. The correspondence
					does not seem to follow a strict arrangement. A set of notebooks, arranged in a
					rough alphabetical order, serves as an index to the letter books, with separate
					listings for incoming and outgoing correspondence. The numbering on the incoming
					letters has no relation to that on the outgoing letters. The index books are
					arranged alphabetically, while the letters themselves are divided between
					"incoming" and "outgoing," then arranged numerically. (Note: Two books were
					originally bound in error, creating a mixed set of incoming and outgoing
					letters, which have been noted in the finding aid.)</p>
        <p>Subseries B: Subject Files, 1897-1901. Tyler's office seems to have maintained
					files relating to only a few issues with which he had to contend while governor.
					The series consists largely of files devoted to political appointments. These
					appointment files were not part of the original subject files but have been
					included here for convenience; they contain letters from applicants for
					appointment (or reappointment) to positions over which the governor had power of
					appointment, together with endorsements from interested parties. The subseries
					also contains files devoted to several controversies which arose during Tyler's
					administration and the use of the Virginia Volunteer Infantry to quell instances
					of civil unrest. These subject files have been assigned file titles and arranged
					in an artificial alphabetical order.</p>
        <p>Subseries C: Gubernatorial Campaign Canvas, 1897. The files in this subseries
					consist of political correspondence from contacts in various localities, arising
					from Tyler's 1897 gubernatorial campaign. Correspondents discuss local political
					activities, contacts, strategies, and outlooks. Arranged alphabetically by
					locality, with cities and counties inter-filed.</p>
        <p>Subseries D: Senatorial Campaign Canvas, 1899. Like Subseries III, this
					subseries contains correspondence from Tyler's local contacts throughout
					Virginia. The correspondence relates to Tyler's failed United States Senate
					campaign of 1899, with letters regarding insight into local political affairs
					and leaders. Arranged alphabetically by locality, with cities and counties
					inter-filed.</p>
        <p>Subseries E: General political correspondence, 1870-1923. This subseries contains
					an extensive collection of Tyler's political correspondence. The letters
					originate from contacts throughout Virginia and beyond and relate to political
					activities and questions of the day (particularly bi-metallism in the late 19th
					century). The subseries also contains correspondence arising from Tyler's
					several political campaigns prior to 1897. (In these earlier contests, the
					correspondence was not sorted according to locality, but like the letters from
					those campaigns, these provide details on local political sentiments and leaders
					during the time period.) Letters relating to the 1897 and 1899 campaigns but not
					tied to any particular Virginia locality may also be found here, as may
					correspondence originating during Tyler's gubernatorial administration but not,
					for whatever reason, bound with the executive letter books. Apart from letters
					addressing the period's political questions, the letters also span the wide
					range of routine matters which one might expect to occupy the chief executive's
					time: invitations to address organizations, requests for personal favors, and
					pleas on behalf of prisoners. The political correspondence continues past
					Tyler's gubernatorial term, as he remained active in party politics and flirted
					with the idea of again running for office. Arranged chronologically, with copies
					of just a few pieces of Tyler's outgoing correspondences inter-filed with the
					incoming correspondence.</p>
        <p>Subseries F: Speeches, 1877-1907. Contained in this subseries is a collection of
					materials relating to political speeches delivered by Tyler. The speech drafts
					are largely undated and fairly illegible. Drafts of other speeches by Tyler may
					be found in Series II, Subseries VII and in Series III, Subseries II. Arranged
					chronologically.</p>
        <p>Subseries G: Printed Materials, 1874-1922. This subseries contains a number of
					pamphlets and speech texts relating to numerous state and political issues,
					particularly Virginia's state debt and the controversy over bi-metallism. Also
					relating to politics, particularly various political races, is a collection of
					newspaper clippings. The subseries also includes a few political broadsides and
					flyers, announcing such things as slates of political speakers. Arranged by
					document type.</p>
        <p>Subseries H: General Materials, 1865-1901. Completing the series, this small
					subseries contains materials relating to the 1889 Virginia Democratic
					Convention, various voter contact lists from 1899, Tyler's notebook from that
					same campaign, notebooks containing the names of Virginia notaries public and
					commissioners of deeds, and some miscellaneous political notes made by Tyler.
					Arranged by document type, then chronologically. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>SERIES II: PERSONAL PAPERS, 1860-1926. This series contains the personal papers of
				Governor J. Hoge Tyler and his wife, Susan Hammet Tyler. The series includes
				correspondence, speech texts, printed materials, and scrapbooks relating to Tyler's
				life and interests. The series is divided among the following subseries:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Subseries A: Presbyterian Church, 1866-1925. This subseries contains materials
					relating to Tyler's involvement in the Presbyterian Church, both locally and
					nationally, through his service as a church elder and his position on the boards
					of the Union Theological Seminary and the Synodical Orphans Home in Lynchburg,
					Virginia. Correspondence within the subseries relates to these activities and to
					Tyler's involvement with other church-related educational institutions within
					Virginia, the temperance movement, and participation in various church councils.
					The subseries also includes drafts of various church-related addresses made by
					Tyler, as well as printed material and ephemera. Also included are two
					unidentified church record books, probably from Radford Presbyterian Church.
					Arranged by document type.</p>
        <p>Subseries B: Genealogy, 1876-1948. The materials in this subseries relate to J.
					Hoge Tyler's interest in his family's history, including the Hoge, Tyler and
					other extended family lines. The subseries includes letters from other
					genealogists, as well as two genealogy manuscripts by Tyler and a collection of
					family history-related newspaper clippings and notes. Arranged by document type,
					then chronologically.</p>
        <p>Subseries C: General Correspondence, 1860-1924. This subseries contains the
					uncategorized personal correspondence of J. Hoge Tyler. The correspondence
					relates to many of Tyler's wide-ranging interests, so many of the letters
					contain references to politics and business activities. Included among the
					correspondence are requests for Tyler to use his influence on behalf of
					relatives and acquaintances, as well letters relating to his involvement with
					the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College. A large percentage of the
					letters here are from members of Tyler's large extended family. (Invitations
					received by the Tylers may be found in Subseries VII, and letters received from
					his children may be found in the various series devoted to each offspring.) The
					subseries contains a relatively small number of drafts of Tyler's outgoing
					correspondence, arranged chronologically. Incoming correspondence has been
					arranged alphabetically by surname.</p>
        <p>Subseries D: Sue Hammet Tyler Papers, 1865-1927. This subseries contains the
					correspondence of Sue Hammet Tyler, wife of J. Hoge Tyler. The correspondence is
					overwhelmingly personal in nature, though some of the letters touch upon
					Governor Tyler's political and business interests. Included here are letters
					written by Mrs. Tyler to her husband, children and others. Among the incoming
					letters are letters from extended family members, including the Heths, Prestons,
					Capertons and others. Also included among the incoming correspondence are the
					many letters of condolence she received upon the governor's death. (For a set of
					farm operation reports made to Mrs. Tyler, see Series III, Subseries II.)</p>
        <p>Subseries E: Scrapbooks, 1871-1925. The first two scrapbooks in this series,
					devoted entirely to newspaper clippings and covering the years 1871-1900, are
					invaluable in tracking Tyler's political career, containing as they do articles,
					editorials, letters to the editor, texts from speeches, and articles about his
					activities, campaigns and gubernatorial administration. The third scrapbook
					(1901-1919) details the latter part of Tyler's term as governor, while the
					remainder is devoted to his later political activities and to personal
					activities and interests. A fourth scrapbook features newspaper articles and
					tributes following Tyler's death (pasted in a ledger containing minutes
					(1896-1898) of the finance committee of an unidentified organization (possibly
					the Radford Trust Company)). The subseries also contains a number of loose items
					which were removed from scrapbooks 1-3. The four scrapbooks are arranged
					chronologically, with the loose materials completing the subseries.</p>
        <p>Subseries F: Printed Materials, 1887-1929. The printed materials included in
					this subseries relate to a wide range of Tyler's personal interests. Included
					are texts of speeches by others; several pamphlets regarding European railways;
					a booklet from the 1900 reunion of the Army of the Potomac; an 1888 promotional
					publication for Radford, Virginia; an 1899 issue of <title  render="italic">The
						Goodson Gazette</title> (published by the Virginia School for the Deaf and
					the Blind); and a copy of the Radford newspaper detailing Tyler's death. The
					subseries also contains a collection of newspaper clippings which include
					poetry, obituaries and articles of general interest.</p>
        <p>Subseries G: General materials, 1868-1926. Contained within this subseries are
					other personal papers of the Tylers that did not belong in other subseries.
					Included here is a file of third-party correspondence belonging to individuals
					not represented elsewhere in the collection, including letters written by James
					Hoge, R. S. Hoge, Laura Fitzhugh Preston, Eliza Hoge Tyler, Henry Tyler and
					others. Also included here are the many invitations and calling cards received
					by the Tyler family. Tyler's service as food administrator for the Federal Food
					Administration in Radford and Montgomery County during World War I is
					represented in a collection of FDA forms and publications. Also included here
					are drafts of talks delivered by Tyler on a variety of subjects to various
					schools and organizations. A collection of miscellaneous materials completes the
					subseries and includes death notices, notes, Tyler's American Red Cross state
					board certificates, poetry, advertising matter, a broadside announcing the sale
					of Plumer Memorial Female College, and other ephemera.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>SERIES III: BUSINESS AND PERSONAL FINANCIAL PAPERS, 1862-1923. Contained in this
				series are papers relating to the various business interests and personal financial
				records of J. Hoge Tyler. The series contains such materials as correspondence,
				ledgers, receipts, personal checks and other legal and financial documents and is
				divided among the following subseries:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Subseries A: Business Concerns, 1882-1922. This subseries contains papers
					originating from the many business ventures in which Tyler engaged but is
					devoted largely to his Belle Hampton Coal Company and the Radford Development
					Company. Also of particular interest are a set of ledgers from a store Tyler
					operated at Belle Hampton. The subseries is arranged alphabetically by name of
					company, then by document type, then chronologically. (Tyler also recorded
					business transactions in ledgers that had once belonged to members of the Hammet
					family. These ledgers may be found in Series XI, Subseries I and III.)</p>
        <p>Subseries B: Agriculture, 1874-1914. This subseries is devoted to Tyler's
					short-horn cattle business and other agricultural pursuits. It includes
					correspondence, cattle pedigrees and registrations. It also includes drafts of
					speeches delivered before agricultural organizations, business records from his
					farm, printed materials relating to agriculture and farming implements, and a
					few miscellaneous documents. (Papers relating to the 1902 Southwest Virginia
					Livestock Fair, with which Tyler was involved, may be found in Series IX.)
					Arranged by document type, then chronologically.</p>
        <p>Subseries C: General Business and Personal Financial Papers, 1862-1923. Within
					this subseries is correspondence relating to other business activities of J.
					Hoge Tyler. The correspondence relates to financial transactions, property sales
					and rentals, the Hammet estate, bank accounts, business proposals (including a
					proposed railway from Charleston, South Carolina to Radford), letters of
					introduction, and others arising from Tyler's myriad business interests. The
					correspondence also includes letters regarding Tyler's household financial
					matters, including a number of letters regarding renovations to Halwick, the
					family home. Also relating to routine financial affairs of the household are
					receipts, account statements, personal checks, and a ledger. Arranged by

        <p>Subseries A: William Henry Hammet Papers, 1832-1878. Contained within this small

					financial and legal matters. The subseries also includes two pocket diaries
					containing miscellaneous notes, some seemingly related to the management of
					Lammermoor Plantation. A separate ledger contains additional records of
					Lammermoor and appears to document the daily work of the plantation's slaves and
					freedmen (much of the information in the ledger has been obscured by newspaper
					clippings relating to Virginia politics later pasted into the book, probably by
					J. Hoge Tyler). Other papers within the subseries detail the plantation's
					accounts, including those with freedmen. The subseries also includes papers
					relating Hammet's other business, legal and personal financial matters. Hammet's
					medical practice is detailed in two ledgers and a folder of papers containing

				extended family of James Hoge Tyler. It includes both studio portraits and snapshots
