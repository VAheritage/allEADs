            <p>Henry Edmundson was born in 1774 in Pennsylvania and moved, when quite young to
                Botetourt County, Virginia with his mother. After marrying Peggy King in 1799, he
                moved to Montgomery County and purchased land there in 1801. Having quickly built an
                estate, he served in the Virginia General Assembly, representing Montgomery County
                on three occasions between 1818 and 1827. He also served as sheriff of Montgomery
                County in 1842 and 1843. On 30 August 1828, Edmundson, in partnership with Elijah
                McClanahan, purchased from George Hancock, Jr. the Alleghany Turnpike--a seven-mile
                long road that ran from the confluence of the north and south forks of the Roanoke
                River to the top of Alleghany Mountain near Christiansburg, VA--along with two
                adjacent tracts of land. Edmundson also acquired the estate, "Fotheringay," which
                would become his residence. McClanahan and Edmundson owned the Turnpike until it was
                sold to the Southwestern Turnpike Company in 1847. Later that same year, Edmundson
                died. His son, Henry Alonzo, born on 14 June 1814, served in the U.S. House of
                Representatives from 1849 to 1861 and as a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate
                Army.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The Henry Edmundson Letters contain nine letters, eight of which were written to
                Edmundson and one, the earliest of the nine, written by Edmundson in 1814 to General
                John Preston. The senders of the various letters include William Ballard Preston;
                Francis H. Smith, superintendent of Virginia Military Institute (V.M.I.); Bernard
                Peyton; Isaac White; and Joseph Robert Woods. One letter, signed simply, "Wade," may
                indicate John Wade, one of the directors of the Lafayette and Ingles Ferry Turnpike.
                The subjects of the letters range quite widely, but many have to do with financial
                matters, including various debts, loans, notes, and Bank of Virginia stock
                certificates. The letter to General Preston, dated 29 November 1814, refers to
                Edmundson's task of procuring hogs, perhaps to supply troops. Bernard Peyton's
                letter to Edmundson of 3 November 1823 is largely about "the progress of our
                unfortunate business with the Treasury," which refers to the aftermath of John
                Preston's tenure as Treasurer of Virginia and the disposition of property to satisfy
                his debt. Francis H. Smith writes to discuss a leave of absence at V.M.I. for
                Edmundson's son.</p>
