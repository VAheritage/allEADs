      <head>Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Incorporated in 1828, the Mine Hill &amp; Schuylkill Haven Railroad opened in 1831, with a line extending 13 miles from Mine Hill, Pennsylvania to nearby Schuylkill Haven. It was not until 1847, however, that steam engines replaced horses and mules as the means by which the line's cars were moved. By 1859, the Mine Hill &amp; Schuylkill Haven had expanded its lines and become one of the most important feeders of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, hauling more than a million tons of coal annually. The line was purchased by the Philadelphia and Reading in the 1930s.
