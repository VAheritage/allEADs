        Libraries consists mainly of condolence items received by the university in the wake of
        April 16, 2007 in which 32 faculty and students were killed. The subseries organization is
        by type of item. The bulk of materials were received in the first few months following April
        16, 2007. There also is a very small series with items specifically sent to or relating to
        those killed, which is organized alphabetically by name.</abstract>

        <head>Processing Information</head>
        <p>The processing, arrangement, and description of the Virginia Tech April 16, 2007 Archives
          of the University Libraries commenced in July 2007 and was completed in summer 2010.
          Processing began at Virginia Tech's Corporate Research Center (CRC). In September of 2008,
          the collection moved to Newman Library, Special Collections.</p>
        <p>Initial processing involved entering metadata about materials in lots. A lot might
          contain one item, for example, a quilt, or 32,000 items, such as a gift of origami cranes.
          After being photographed, selected items were arranged, described and housed in archival
          containers. Thus, there is a digital collection and a physical collection; both contain
          selected items, some of which are represented in only one of these collections. Close to
          7,000 lots of items were accessioned.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Note:</emph> The names of the victims are given in their complete
          form in the finding aid even though they may be represented on the actual items in a much
          more informal way. Recognizing names was sometimes difficult. </p>
        <p>Since there were two Daniels--Daniel Perez Cueva and Daniel Patrick O'Neil--and two
          Matthews--Matthew Gregory Gwaltney and Matthew Joseph La Porte--it sometimes was not clear
          which person was intended; therefore abbreviated names were included as they were written.
          An effort was made to record any instances in which a specific name appeared on an item.
          An effort was also made to record social commentary as it appeared on items.</p>

      <head>Historical Information</head>
      <p>On the morning of April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho shot and killed two students in West Ambler
        Johnston Residence Hall. About two hours later, Cho proceeded to Norris Hall, a building on
        the other side of the campus. When in Norris Hall he shot and killed five professors and 25
        students, and injured over two dozen others, before turning the gun on himself.</p>
      <p>The night of April 16, 2007, Hokies United, a student-organized response group, set up a
        memorial shrine with a semicircle of stones on the Drillfield in front of Burruss Hall, the
        university's administration building. The next day students placed large plywood boards,
        painted white, on the Drillfield for people to sign and leave expressions of grief, support,
        etc. Other spontaneous shrines appeared on campus and in the community.</p>
      <p>The events of April 16, 2007, received intense media coverage, and people around the world
        responded. Virginia Tech received over 90,000 condolence items from all 50 states and 80
        countries. These items included banners, posters, books of condolences, sound materials,
        various media materials, poetry, correspondence, resolutions, textiles, memorabilia,
        ephemera, and handcrafted items. Thousands of these items were displayed for the university
        community through University Unions and Student Activities' Squires Student Union.</p>
      <p>Items continued to be received for months and years afterwards, and families of those
        killed were offered the option of receiving many materials directly related to their loved
        ones from the Office of Recovery and Support, or having them placed in storage for later
        retrieval.</p>
      <p>We continue to remember the 32 victims:</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Virginia Tech April 16, 2007 Archives of the University Libraries consists mainly of
        condolence items received by the university following the events of April 16, 2007. The bulk
        of materials were received in the first few months following April 16, 2007.</p>
      <p>The collection is arranged using standard archival procedures. Due to the unique nature of
        this collection (i.e., the way it was received, the variety of formats, and the content),
        archivists developed specialized arrangement and description procedures. Since the
        collection and its contents are unique, the arrangement and description of individual series
        and subseries may differ.</p>
      <p>The collection contains two series, Series I: Condolence Series and Series II: Individual
        Collections. Series I: Condolence Material includes twelve subseries, described in the
        "Arrangement" note below. Series II: Individual Collections has no subseries.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement>
      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The collection is arranged in the following series:</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series I. Condolence Materials, 2007-2010</emph>. This series was
        arranged in 12 subseries. The items were arranged according to the person or organization
        who donated the materials. Within these groupings, the items were further categorized
        alphabetically.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Subseries 1. Banners, pp. 1-62.</emph></p>
      <p>This subseries contains banners received by Virginia Tech following the events of April 16,
        2007. Banners were defined as items that could be rolled or folded. Some banners were made
        of cloth or vinyl. Many of the banners were signed and/or included messages. In some cases,
        the finding aid includes notes about the content of these messages. An effort was made to
        note any instances in which the names of any of the 32 victims appeared on the banners.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Subseries 2. Posters, pp. 63-92.</emph></p>
      <p>This subseries contains posters received by Virginia Tech following the events that
        occurred on campus on April 16, 2007. Many of the posters were signed and/or included
        messages. In some cases, the finding aid includes notes about the content of these messages.
        An effort was made to note any instances in which the names of any of the 32 victims
        appeared on the posters.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Subseries 3. Books of Condolences, pp. 93-113.</emph></p>
      <p>This subseries contains books of condolences received by Virginia Tech following the events
        of April 16, 2007. Although gathered under the broad term of books of condolences, the items
        in this series appear in a wide array of formats and sizes. While a number of the materials
        take the form of traditional books of condolences, most are of a more informal, impromptu
        nature. Many of the items in this subseries contain messages from people who gathered at
        memorial ceremonies throughout the United States and the world.</p>
      <p>Other books had simply been put in public places to receive the names and messages of
        passersby before being sent to Virginia Tech. In addition to names and messages, many of the
        items in this series include photographs, original artwork, and poetry.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Subseries 4. Sound Materials: Audio CD, Sound Cassettes, Sheet Music,
          and Song Lyrics, pp. 114-125.</emph></p>
      <p>This subseries contains various sound materials such as audio CDs, audio cassettes, sheet
        music, and song lyrics received by Virginia Tech following the events of April 16, 2007.
        There is also some overlap between this subseries and Subseries 5.</p>
      <p>This subseries was arranged alphabetically by donor name. The donor may or may not be the
        creator of the item.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Subseries 5. Videos, DVDs, CDs, and Slideshows, pp. 126-133.</emph></p>
      <p>This subseries contains materials that have visual content, including videos, DVDs, CDs,
        and slideshows that were received by Virginia Tech following the events of April 16, 2007.
        There is also some overlap between this subseries and Subseries 4.</p>
      <p>This subseries was arranged alphabetically by donor name. The donor may or may not be the
        creator of the item.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Subseries 6. Correspondence, pp. 134-292.</emph></p>
      <p>Following the events of April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech received cards and letters of
        condolence from organizations and individuals across the United States and internationally.
        A majority of the correspondence appears in standard greeting card format, in letters, and
        in oversize cards. Some contain messages from several individuals. Many of these cards were
        handmade, and some senders enclosed newspaper clippings or religious literature. Many cards
        and letters feature artwork, especially items sent from children. Other significant
        materials include official letters from international embassies and governments.</p>
      <p>In general, all of the cards and letters were organized according to the sender; domestic
        and international correspondence remains separated. The items were arranged according to the
        nature of the creator from which they were received. Within these groupings, the items were
        further categorized alphabetically. Specifically, the Department of Foreign Languages and
        Literatures of Virginia Tech received many condolence artifacts, including correspondence
        and floral arrangements; these items were arranged separately. While a substantial portion
        of condolences were sent directly to Virginia Tech or one of its departments, some
        correspondence was sent to the Blacksburg and Virginia Tech police departments. Many of
        these cards came from fellow police departments, EMTs, fire departments, and other public
        service agencies; these items were arranged separately.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Subseries 7. Photographs and Digital Images, pp. 293-328.</emph></p>
      <p>This subseries contains photographs and digital images sent to Virginia Tech following the
        events of April 16, 2007. Groups and individuals are pictured, for example, wearing Virginia
        Tech colors, holding a memorial service, or raising money for the Hokie Spirit Fund. Other
        subseries may include photographs.</p>
      <p>This subseries was arranged alphabetically by donor name. The donor may or may not be the
        creator of the item.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Subseries 8. Textiles, Memorabilia, Artwork, and Handcrafted Items, pp.
          329-381.</emph></p>
      <p>This subseries includes a wide variety of items sent to Virginia Tech following the events
        of April 16, 2007. The subseries includes items such as quilts, drawings, paintings, a car
        hood, sports memorabilia, U.S. flags flown at various places in honor of the victims,
        t-shirts, and a life preserver.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Subseries 9. Poetry, pp. 382-412.</emph></p>
      <p>This subseries consists of poems composed or sent by individuals from across the United
        States. Some organizations sending poetry include schools, churches, colleges, and
        universities. Anonymous poems are also included.</p>
      <p>This subseries was arranged into two groups: poetry sent by organizations or groups and
        poetry sent by individuals. Each group was alphabetized by the name of the organization or
        individual.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Subseries 10. Resolutions, Proclamations, Declarations, Bills, and
          Other Legislation, pp. 413-422.</emph></p>
      <p>This subseries consists of official resolutions and proclamations passed by the governing
        bodies for colleges and universities, organizations, and state and local governments.
        Additional correspondence accompanies some of the resolutions.</p>
      <p>Resolutions were arranged in alphabetical order by organization name, with oversized items
        in separate boxes.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Subseries 11. Books, pp. 423-425.</emph></p>
      <p>This subseries consists of books and booklets received by Virginia Tech following the
        events of April 16, 2007. Subjects of the books include handling grief and grieving or are
        offered as possible sources of consolation. </p>
      <p>Books were arranged alphabetically by donor name. The donor may or may not be the creator

      <p><emph render="bold">Subseries 12. Sample Collection of Materials Received by Individual
          Families of Victims, pp. 426-431.</emph></p>
      <p>This subseries includes materials sent to the family of an individual victim. The material
        in the subseries, although anonymous, represents the cross section of gifts and items given
        to the families and the University community. The subseries contains music and DVD
        recordings of songs written for or performed on behalf of the victims, as well as recordings
        of memorial events on campus. There are cards, poetry, and books of condolences from
        schools, universities, religious organizations, and individuals. Memorabilia includes a flag
        flown at the United States Capitol, a knitted prayer shawl, original artwork from an alumna,
        and a candle burned at a New York University vigil. The subseries also contains publications
        and programs from memorial events on the Virginia Tech campus.</p>
      <p>The subseries was arranged alphabetically by donor name. The donor may or may not be the
        creator of the material.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series II. Individual Series, pp. 432-433.</emph></p>
      <p>This very small series contains items either sent to or specifically relating to the
