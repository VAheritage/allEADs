        The Virginia Tech April 16, 2007 Archives of the University Libraries consists mainly of condolence items received by the university in the wake of April 16, 2007 in which 32 faculty and students were killed. The subseries organization is by type of item. The bulk of materials were received in the first few months following April 16, 2007. There also is a very small series with items specifically sent to or relating to those killed, which is organized alphabetically by name.

        <p>The processing, arrangement, and description of the Virginia Tech April 16, 2007 Archives of the University Libraries commenced in July 2007 and was completed in summer 2010. Processing began at Virginia Tech's Corporate Research Center (CRC). In September of 2008, the collection moved to Newman Library, Special Collections.</p>
        <p>Initial processing involved entering metadata about materials in lots. A lot might contain one item, for example, a quilt, or 32,000 items, such as a gift of origami cranes. After being photographed, selected items were arranged, described and housed in archival containers. Thus, there is a digital collection and a physical collection; both contain selected items, some of which are represented in only one of these collections. Close to 7,000 lots of items were accessioned.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Note:</emph> The names of the victims are given in their complete form in the finding aid even though they may be represented on the actual items in a much more informal way. Recognizing names was sometimes difficult. </p>
        <p>Since there were two Daniels--Daniel Perez Cueva and Daniel Patrick O'Neil--and two Matthews--Matthew Gregory Gwaltney and Matthew Joseph La Porte--it sometimes was not clear which person was intended; therefore abbreviated names were included as they were written. An effort was made to record any instances in which a specific name appeared on an item. An effort was also made to record social commentary as it appeared on items.</p>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>On the morning of April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho shot and killed two students in West Ambler Johnston Residence Hall. About two hours later, Cho proceeded to Norris Hall, a building on the other side of the campus. When in Norris Hall he shot and killed five professors and 25 students, and injured over two dozen others, before turning the gun on himself.</p>
      <p>The night of April 16, 2007, Hokies United, a student-organized response group, set up a memorial shrine with a semicircle of stones on the Drillfield in front of Burruss Hall, the university's administration building. The next day students placed large plywood boards, painted white, on the Drillfield for people to sign and leave expressions of grief, support, etc. Other spontaneous shrines appeared on campus and in the community.</p>
      <p>The events of April 16, 2007, received intense media coverage, and people around the world responded. Virginia Tech received over 90,000 condolence items from all 50 states and 80 countries. These items included banners, posters, books of condolences, sound materials, various media materials, poetry, correspondence, resolutions, textiles, memorabilia, ephemera, and handcrafted items. Thousands of these items were displayed for the university community through University Unions and Student Activities' Squires Student Union.</p>
      <p>Items continued to be received for months and years afterwards, and families of those killed were offered the option of receiving many materials directly related to their loved ones from the Office of Recovery and Support, or having them placed in storage for later retrieval.</p>
      <p>We continue to remember the 32 victims:</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Virginia Tech April 16, 2007 Archives of the University Libraries consists mainly of condolence items received by the university following the events of April 16, 2007. The bulk of materials were received in the first few months following April 16, 2007.</p>
      <p>The collection is arranged using standard archival procedures. Due to the unique nature of this collection (i.e., the way it was received, the variety of formats, and the content), archivists developed specialized arrangement and description procedures. Since the collection and its contents are unique, the arrangement and description of individual series and subseries may differ.</p>
      <p>The collection contains two series, Series I: Condolence Series and Series II: Individual Collections. Series I: Condolence Material includes twelve subseries, described in the "Arrangement" note below. Series II: Individual Collections has no subseries.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement>
      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The collection is arranged in the following series:</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series I. Condolence Materials</emph>.</p> 
      <p>This series was arranged in 12 subseries. The items were arranged according to the person or organization who donated the materials. Within these groupings, the items were further categorized alphabetically.</p>
	      <p>Subseries 1. Banners</p><p>This subseries contains banners received by Virginia Tech following the events of April 16, 2007. Banners were defined as items that could be rolled or folded. Some banners were made of cloth or vinyl. Many of the banners were signed and/or included messages. In some cases, the finding aid includes notes about the content of these messages. An effort was made to note any instances in which the names of any of the 32 victims appeared on the banners.</p>
	      <p>Subseries 2. Posters</p><p>This subseries contains posters received by Virginia Tech following the events that occurred on campus on April 16, 2007. Many of the posters were signed and/or included messages. In some cases, the finding aid includes notes about the content of these messages. An effort was made to note any instances in which the names of any of the 32 victims appeared on the posters.</p>
	      <p>Subseries 3. Books of Condolences</p><p>This subseries contains posters received by Virginia Tech following the events that occurred on campus on April 16, 2007. Many of the posters were signed and/or included messages. In some cases, the finding aid includes notes about the content of these messages.

	      <p>Subseries 4. Sound Materials: Audio CD, Sound Cassettes, Sheet Music, and Song Lyrics</p><p>This subseries contains various sound materials such as audio CDs, audio cassettes, sheet music, and song lyrics received by Virginia Tech following the events of April 16, 2007. There is also some overlap between this subseries and Subseries 5.</p><p>This subseries was arranged alphabetically by donor name. The donor may or may not be the creator of the item.</p>
	      <p>Subseries 5. Videos, DVDs, CDs, and Slideshows</p><p>This subseries contains materials that have visual content, including videos, DVDs, CDs, and slideshows that were received by Virginia Tech following the events of April 16, 2007.

	      <p>Subseries 6. Correspondence</p><p>Following the events of April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech received cards and letters of condolence from organizations and individuals across the United States and internationally. A majority of the correspondence appears in standard greeting card format, in letters, and in oversize cards. Some contain messages from several individuals. Many of these cards were handmade, and some senders enclosed newspaper clippings or religious literature. Many cards and letters feature artwork, especially items sent from children. Other significant materials include official letters from international embassies and governments.</p><p>In general, all of the cards and letters were organized according to the sender; domestic and international correspondence remains separated. The items were arranged according to the nature of the creator from which they were received. Within these groupings, the items were further categorized alphabetically. Specifically, the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures of Virginia Tech received many condolence artifacts, including correspondence and floral arrangements; these items were arranged separately. While a substantial portion of condolences were sent directly to Virginia Tech or one of its departments, some correspondence was sent to the Blacksburg and Virginia Tech police departments. Many of these cards came from fellow police departments, EMTs, fire departments, and other public service agencies; these items were arranged separately.</p>
