      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Charles H. Burchard was the founding dean of Virginia Tech's College of Architecture and
        Urban Studies. During Charles Burchard's 14-year tenure as dean from 1965 to 1979, he
        transformed the Department of Architecture into one of the nation's top colleges. When a new
        addition was added to the existing architecture building it was called the Charles Burchard
        Hall.</p>
      <p>In 1965, then-President T. Marshall Hahn recruited Burchard to come to Virginia Tech as
        part of Hahn's sweeping initiative to transform Virginia Tech from a technical institute to
        a major comprehensive university. As dean of architecture, Burchard enlisted an imaginative
        and innovative faculty, installed a new five-year undergraduate program and restructured the
        master of architecture program. He complemented those programs with bachelor's and master's
        programs in urban affairs and landscape architecture, a doctoral program in environmental
        design and planning, and a study-abroad program in Switzerland. For building what became a
        model for architectural schools around the country, he was designated a University
        Distinguished Professor in 1966 and later received the University Distinguished Achievement
        Award in 1985. Upon his retirement, he was bestowed the honored title of dean emeritus.
        After gaining national prominence as an innovative leader in architectural education,
        Burchard was elected a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1970. In
        1983, he was presented the Award for Excellence in Architectural Education, the joint award
        of the AIA and the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA). Burchard, a
        prolific writer, outlined his concepts of architectural education in numerous professional
        journal articles, monologues, and in papers delivered in many professional conferences
        throughout the world. He became active nationally as a director of the National
        Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), president of the ACSA, and chairman of NAAB
        evaluation teams visiting various campuses across the country. Burchard earned his
        bachelor's in architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At the Harvard
        School of Design, he studied under world-renowned architect Walter Gropius and received his
        master's degree in 1940. Burchard was 75 when he died in 1990.</p>

        Polytechnic Institute (later Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University). Materials
        in this collection span Burchard's education and career, dating from between about 1935 and

        &amp; Proposals; Publications &amp; Reports; Personal Papers; Multimedia &amp; Audio/Visual;
        and Artifacts. Most series contain multiple sub-series and in some cases, there is overlap

            sketches, blueprints, plans, and some photographs and boards relating to professional
