      <p>Raphael C. Bauserman was born on January 1, 1837 and died on May 5, 1912. He had a
                fair complexion, gray eyes, and black hair. On May 1, 1862, he enlisted as a Private
                in the Confederate 12th Virginia Cavalry, Company K. He served until April 20, 1965
                when he was paroled at Mt. Jackson. During his military career, he lost a horse
                appraised at $550 at Brandy Station on June 9, 1863. Additionally, he was AWOL
                between January and February and between July and August of 1865. On January 21,
                1891, Raphael married Sarah F. Lindamood; their children include Mary Frances,
                Vernie Virginia, and Harry H. </p>
      <p>Erasmus Bauserman was born on March 18, 1842 and died on February 14, 1913. He was
                5'11 and like his brother had a fair complexion, gray eyes, and black hair. On
                September 22, 1862, he joined his brother's unit, enlisting at Woodstock, Virginia.
                During his military career, he was AOWL between January and February 1864. On April
                20, 1865, he was paroled at Mt. Jackson. Erasmus married Mary C. Funkhouser on
                September 14, 1871; they had a son named Charles Casper.</p>
      <p>These two brothers were born to Reuben (died in 1860) and Mary Bauserman (born on
                March 17, 1814 and died on December 27, 1886).Other siblings include Robert
                Alexander, Elizabeth A, Sarah, Mary F, and John 0. The family resided in what is now
                known as the "Harry Bauserman Home" located in Jackson, Virginia. The house was
                built in 1818 and bought by Reuben Bauserman in 1850. The house was willed to Mary,
                then to Raphael, and then to his son, Harry. </p>
      <p>Both brothers served in Virginia's 12th Cavalry, which was assembled in the summer of
                1862, drawing men from across ten counties within Shenandoah Valley, Virginia. Over
                the course of three years, the unit engaged Union troops over a hundred times,
                including participating in the Second Battle of Bull Run.</p>
