      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Sherwood Anderson (1876-1941) was born in the small town of Camden, Ohio to Irwin McClain
        Anderson (d.1919) and Emma Jane Smith (d.1895). While Anderson excelled as a student, he
        quit school at the age of 14 to help support his family, taking on a wide variety of jobs.
        After his mother's death, he relocated to Chicago for the first time, working and taking a
        few night classes. He served briefly in Cuba during he Spanish-American War, but was sent
        there after combat had ended. A few months later, he returned to Clyde, then moved to
        Springfield, Ohio, in 1899, where he completed his senior year at Wittenburg Academy, a prep
        school. His graduation speech resulted in his being offered a job as an advertising
        solicitor and he moved to back to Chicago.</p>
      <p>In 1903, work travels took him to Toledo, Ohio, where he met Cornelia Pratt Lane, his first
        wife. The couple married in 1904 and had three children: Robert Lane (1907-1951), John
        Sherwood (1908-1995) and Marion (Mimi) (1911-1996). In 1906, they relocated to Cleveland
        when Anderson became the president of the United Factories Company, a mail-order firm. The
        following year he departed the company, took his family to Elyria, Ohio, and started the
        Anderson Manufacturing Co., another mail order business. </p>
      <p>In 1912, Anderson suffered a nervous breakdown. He returned to Chicago yet again and began
        work writing advertising copy and becoming part of the writer and artist scene of the city.
        In 1916, he divorced Cornelia Pratt and married Tennessee Mitchell, a sculptor. He also
        published his first novel, <title render="italic">Windy McPherson's Son</title>, the first
        of three books in a deal with publisher John Lane. It was beginning of his writing career.
        1919 saw the publication of his short story collection, <title render="italic">Winesburg,
          Ohio</title>, one of his most well-know works. In 1924, he divorced Tennessee Mitchell and
        marred Elizabeth Prall. They lived in New York and New Orleans, and traveled in Europe, too.
        With profits from his novel 1925 Dark Laughter, Anderson bought Ripshin Farm, later just
        Ripshin, as a summer home, in 1926. He also acquired both local newspapers, the <title
          render="italic">Smyth County News</title> and the <title render="italic">Marion
            Democrat</title>. His son, Robert, helped with, and eventually took over management of the
        newspapers in 1929. Around the same time, Anderson began a tour of the south and its factory
        towns with Eleanor Copenhaver, which shaped several of his later non-fiction publications. </p>
      <p>In 1932, Anderson divorced Elizabeth Prall and the following year, married Eleanor
        Copenhaver (1896-1985). Southwest Virginia was a powerful influence on his later stories and
        novels. His life in around Marion and Troutdale, Virginia, was the focus of his writing for
        the newspapers, as well. At the same time, he was still writing novels and short stories for
        magazines. In 1941, Sherwood and Eleanor Anderson left for a trip to South America. During
        the trip, after ingesting a toothpick, Anderson developed peritonitis and was hospitalized
        in Panama, where he passed away on March 8, 1941. He is buried in Round Hill Cemetery in
        Marion, Virginia. </p>
      <p>Over his lifetime, Anderson published 8 novels, 4 collections of short stories, 2
        collections of poetry, 1 collection of plays, and 12 works of non-fiction. Following his
        death, publishers and scholars have produced memoirs, critical editions, and several volumes
        of his collected letters. During his life, he was influential on the careers of William
        Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway, and maintained extensive correspondence and friendships with
        authors, artists, publishers, and critics (though he later wrote that he had given up
        reading reviews).</p>
