      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Sherwood Anderson (1876-1941) was born in the small town of Camden, Ohio to a large
                and impoverished family. An outstanding student, Anderson quit school at 14 to help
                support his family. In 1895 he volunteered for the Spanish-American War, then spent
                one year in Wittenburg College. He worked as a laborer in Chicago and later as a
                writer in an advertising agency. Unable to resist the urge to write and live a
                bohemian lifestyle, Anderson suffered an emotional breakdown and walked away from
                his family and his mail-order paint business. He had three children (two sons and a
                daughter) from his first marriage. Anderson eventually married three more times.</p>
      <p>Anderson published 27 books, plays, and volumes of short stories, along with numerous
                articles in periodicals. Often controversial, he wrote about issues as diverse as
                the sexual awakening of adolescence to the alienation caused by industrialization.
                He was very active in the intellectual community of the day and was instrumental in
                helping both Faulkner and Hemingway to be published for the first time.</p>
      <p>Anderson wrote to his daughter from Kansas City in March, 1933, "As you know, my
                dear, I never did domesticate well," but he always maintained relationships with his
                children. Later in life, Anderson embarked on his fourth--and only
                successful--marriage, to Eleanor Copenhaver, a native of Marion, Virginia. They
                traveled extensively and spent summers on their rural farm, "Ripshin," near Marion.
                Anderson bought and operated both of Marion's local newspapers and eventually passed
                ownership along to his eldest son, Robert.</p>
      <p>Sherwood Anderson died on the first leg of a long-anticipated trip to South America.
                He developed peritonitis and was hospitalized in Panama, where he passed away on
                March 8, 1941.</p>
