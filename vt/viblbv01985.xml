      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>Virginia Tech's roots go back to 1851, when the Olin and Preston Institute opened in
        Blacksburg, Virginia. After closing during the American Civil War, it chartered as a college
        called the Preston and Olin Institute in 1869.</p>
      <p>In 1872, Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (VAMC) was established as a
        land-grant institute by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The first 12 students were awarded
        non-degree diplomas in 1875, and the first Bachelor of Arts degrees were awarded in 1883.
        The first Bachelor of and Master of Science degrees were awarded in 1892. The first
        Doctorate of Philosophy degree was awarded in 1942.</p>
      <p>In 1895, the university was renamed Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and
        Polytechnic Institute (VAMC&amp;PI), and in 1944 it became Virginia Polytechnic Institute
        (VPI). Finally, it became Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI&amp;SU)
        in 1970. Nicknames over the years include VAMC, VPI, VT, and Virginia Tech.</p>
