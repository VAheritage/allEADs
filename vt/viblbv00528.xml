			<head>Biographical Information </head>
			<p>Eliza &quot;Lida&quot; Robertson Seymour Fiske (c.1856-1922) was the daughter of
				Lucretia R. Seymour (born c.1832) and Dr. James H. Seymour (c.1825-1862). Lida
				married William Warren Fiske (born abt. 1857-1930s?)&mdash;son of Harriet M. Fiske
				(c.1823-1903)&mdash;on November 25, 1880. Both Lida and William were devout
				Christians. The couple lived in Philadelphia where William worked as a printer. Lida
				and William had four children&mdash;Robert Seymour (b.1885), Fleda (1888-1935),
				Donald Robertson (b.1891), and Seymour (b.1895). Fleda married Albert H. Ochsner
				(c.1889-1964)&mdash;a man she met on a return trip from her (Wellesley College)
				junior year abroad in Germany&mdash;and the couple had two children, Albert
				(b.1913) and Seymour Fiske(1915-2005). At least one source mentions a third child,
				but little information is available. </p>
			<p>Fleda and Albert moved to Eastover&mdash;a large farm in Spring Grove,
				Virginia&mdash;in late 1913. The house was purchased by Albert's father, Dr. Albert
				J. Ochsner, who was a practicing surgeon in Chicago. While Albert had received both
				his Bachelor's and Master's degree in Agriculture, the property measured about 700
				acres and the main building was in poor condition, providing quite a challenge to
				the young couple. On a property adjacent to Eastover, a small house was built for
				William W. Fiske (Fleda's father) that was referred to as &quot;The Fiske
				Place.&quot; William got little use of the house, however, with his wife (Lida)
				dying in 1923 and him following in the early 1930s. Fleda, herself, passed away in
				1935, and Albert remarried. </p>

			<head>Scope and Content </head>
			<p>The Fiske-Seymour Family Papers are separated into three series: Series I: Correspondence,
				Series II: Photographs, and Series III: Family Papers and Ephemera. The first series contains around 600 letters
				written by various members of the Fiske and Seymour families, as well as family
				friends. The bulk of the letters were written by William W. Fiske (over 200 letters)
				and Lida S. Fiske (over 100 letters). Many of these letters were written before Lida
				and William were married, and many of them were written while William was traveling
				for his job. Other substantial writers were Fleda F. Ochsner and Lucretia R.
				Seymour, writing over 50 letters each. The Family Correspondence folders contain
				letters written by family and friends that do not exceed more than two or
				three in number by each individual. </p>
			<p>The collection also contains over 30 photographs of family members, as well as
				family-owned properties. Most of the photographs are undated. The Family Papers and
				Ephemera series contains newspaper and magazine clippings (some written by family
				members), programs for various events, school papers, and calling cards. </p>

		<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
			<head>Arrangement </head>
			<p>The collection is arranged in three series: Series I: Correspondence, Series II: Photographs, and Series III: Family
				Papers and Ephemera. Series I: Correspondence is arranged alphabetically by author.
				Each author's letters are arranged chronologically with undated letters last. The
				Family Correspondence folders are arranged alphabetically by author with
				unidentified authors last. Series II: Photographs is arranged by subject matter.
				Series III: Family Papers and Ephemera is arranged by material type. </p>
