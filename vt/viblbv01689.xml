            <p>Lieutenant commander in U.S. Navy and member of Admiral Halsey's staff writes from the scene of the Japanese surrender aboard the <emph render="italic">U.S.S. Missouri</emph> on September 2, 1945. He describes the surrender ceremony in detail, particularly his impressions of U.S. military leaders and representatives of other nations participating in the ceremony. The letter was written to Floyd McElroy, a friend and former colleague. Also included in the collection is a letter dated October 4, 1945 from McElroy in which he sends a photostatic copy of Marshall's original letter to Ernest M. Bernstein. It is this copy of Marshall's letter that is in the collection.</p>

            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>As reporrted by Floyd McElroy, John F. Marshall's parents were missionaries in Burma prior to World War II and were evacuated to India and then returned to the United States following the Japanese invasion of Burma in December 1941. After the fall of Singapore in February 1942, John F. Marshall enlisted in the Navy and received at least part of his training at Naval Air Station Quonset Point in Rhode Island before arriving for duty in the South Pacific theater. On May 18, 1945, having attained the rank of Lieutenant Commander, Marshall reported on board the <emph render="italic">U.S.S. Missouri</emph>, the flagship of William (Bull) Halsey's Third Fleet, to join the Admiral's staff. He was on the <emph render="italic">Missouri</emph> on September 2, 1945 in Tokyo Bay when he described the official surrender of the Japanese that took place on that ship in a letter to friend and former colleague, Floyd McElroy. McElroy was Vice-President of Loomis-Sayles, &amp; Company, an investment firm based in Boston with an office in San Francisco. Marshall worked in that San Francisco office prior to the war and, apparently returned to work there after the war.</p>
