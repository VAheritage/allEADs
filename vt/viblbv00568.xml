      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Atkinson, Archibald, Jr., M.D., Professor of Materia Medica and Therapeutics in the
                College of Physicians and Surgeons, Baltimore, was born February 23, 1832, near
                Smithfield, on the James River, Isle of Wight County, Virginia. His father was an
                eminent lawyer, and represented the Second Congressional District of Virginia in the
                United States Congress from 1844 to 1848. Dr. Atkinson received his education at the
                University of Virginia, and graduated in medicine at the University of Pennsylvania
                in the spring of 1854. After receiving his diploma he went abroad and enjoyed the
                advantages of the clinics of the most famous hospitals of Paris for eighteen months,
                and a six months' residence in the Rotunda Lying-in Hospital of Dublin, Ireland.
                Returning to America in 1856 he located in Baltimore, where he practiced his
                profession until the outbreak of the late civil war, when he returned to his native
                State and was appointed Assistant Surgeon in the Wise Legion in West Virginia, and
                assigned to the charge of the Lewisburg Hospital.</p>
      <p>In 1862, Dr. Atkinson was selected as the Surgeon of the Tenth Regiment, Virginia
                Cavalry, belonging to General J.E.B. Stuart's command, and in autumn of 1863 was
                assigned to the Thirty-first Virginia Regiment of Infantry. Subsequently he was
                appointed Brigade-Surgeon in General John Pegram's Brigade, Early's Division, Second
                Army Corps, of the Army of Northern Virginia. At the termination of the war he
                established himself in the practice of his profession in his native town of
                Smithfield, Virginia, continuing there until the spring of 1873, when he removed to
                Baltimore and located on North Charles Street. In the fall of 1875 Dr. Atkinson was
                elected to the chair of Materia Medica and Therapeutics in the College of Physicians
                and Surgeons of Baltimore, a position he has filled with rare ability and eminent
                success as an imparter of medical knowledge. His maternal ancestors were the Powells
                and Chiltons of Loudon County, Virginia, whose progenitors originally came from
                Scotland and Wales. His ancestors on the paternal side were English.</p>
      <p>He has a brother, Dr. Robert Chilton Atkinson, who is practicing medicine at St.
                Louis, Missouri. On November 2, 1858, Dr. Atkinson married Mary Elizabeth Thomas, of
                Smithfield, Virginia, daughter of Samuel Thomas, whose wife was Frances Harrison
                Woodley, daughter of Major Woodley, of Smithfield. The issue of the marriage is two
                children, Mary Chilton and Louis Woodley Atkinson, both of whom are living.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>Written sometime around 1900, the document recounts the military career of Archibald
                Atkinson, Jr. as a doctor in the Confederate Army. The memoir was writen in a
                commercially prepared notebook (printed, lined paper) on a total of 58 pages. The
                transcription preserves the page and line breaks as they appear in the original.
                Links throughout the transcript point to additional information on relevent people and
                places.</p>
      <p>The memoir seems to begin in the middle of the text; there is no introductory
                material or conclusion. There may well have been another notebook with the first
                part of the narrative; if so, there is no indication anywhere on the notebook
                preserved at Virginia Tech of its existence.</p>
