      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Atkinson, Archibald, Jr., M.D., Professor of Materia Medica and Therapeutics in the College
        of Physicians and Surgeons, Baltimore, was born February 23, 1832, near Smithfield, on the
        James River, Isle of Wight County, Virginia. His father was an eminent lawyer, and
        represented the Second Congressional District of Virginia in the United States Congress from
        1844 to 1848. Dr. Atkinson received his education at the University of Virginia, and
        graduated in medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the spring of 1854. After
        receiving his diploma he went abroad and enjoyed the advantages of the clinics of the most
        famous hospitals of Paris for eighteen months, and a six months' residence in the Rotunda
        Lying-in Hospital of Dublin, Ireland. Returning to America in 1856 he located in Baltimore,
        where he practiced his profession until the outbreak of the late civil war, when he returned
        to his native State and was appointed Assistant Surgeon in the Wise Legion in West Virginia,
        and assigned to the charge of the Lewisburg Hospital.</p>
      <p>In 1862, Dr. Atkinson was selected as the Surgeon of the Tenth Regiment, Virginia Cavalry,
        belonging to General J.E.B. Stuart's command, and in autumn of 1863 was assigned to the
        Thirty-first Virginia Regiment of Infantry. Subsequently he was appointed Brigade-Surgeon in
        General John Pegram's Brigade, Early's Division, Second Army Corps, of the Army of Northern
        Virginia. At the termination of the war he established himself in the practice of his
        profession in his native town of Smithfield, Virginia, continuing there until the spring of
        1873, when he removed to Baltimore and located on North Charles Street. In the fall of 1875
        Dr. Atkinson was elected to the chair of Materia Medica and Therapeutics in the College of
        Physicians and Surgeons of Baltimore, a position he has filled with rare ability and eminent
        success as an imparter of medical knowledge. His maternal ancestors were the Powells and
        Chiltons of Loudon County, Virginia, whose progenitors originally came from Scotland and
        Wales. His ancestors on the paternal side were English.</p>
      <p>He has a brother, Dr. Robert Chilton Atkinson, who is practicing medicine at St. Louis,
        Missouri. On November 2, 1858, Dr. Atkinson married Mary Elizabeth Thomas, of Smithfield,
        Virginia, daughter of Samuel Thomas, whose wife was Frances Harrison Woodley, daughter of
        Major Woodley, of Smithfield. The issue of the marriage is two children, Mary Chilton and
        Louis Woodley Atkinson, both of whom are living.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>Written sometime around 1900, the document recounts the military career of Archibald
        Atkinson, Jr. as a doctor in the Confederate Army. The memoir was writen in a commercially
        prepared notebook (printed, lined paper) on a total of 58 pages. The transcription preserves
        the page and line breaks as they appear in the original. Links throughout the transcript
        point to additional information on relevent people and places.</p>
      <p>The memoir seems to begin in the middle of the text; there is no introductory material or
        conclusion. There may well have been another notebook with the first part of the narrative;
        if so, there is no indication anywhere on the notebook preserved at Virginia Tech of its
        existence.</p>
