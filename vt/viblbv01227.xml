            <p>Roger Preston Chew, born April 9, 1843 in Loudan County, Virginia, was a Confederate commander during the Civil War. Having graduated from the Virginia Military Institute after completing an accelerated program, Chew served as captain of the "Ashby" Battery of the horse artillery, serving under Stonewall Jackson until his death. Following Jackson's death, Chew was promoted to chief of the cavalry guns under J.E.B. Stuart. Under Stuart, Chew served through the Gettysburg Campaign, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, Cold Harbor, the Siege of Petersburg, and the Appomattox Campaign, eventually being promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on February 18, 1865.</p>
            <p>After the war, Chew married Louise Fontaine Washington, daughter of John Augustine Washington. Chew went on to serve the West Virginia Legislature from 1882-1888. In 1890, with several business partners, Chew formed the Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing, and Improvement Company and became its first president. Chew died on March 16, 1921 in Charles Town, West Virginia.</p>
