      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>Jana (Zhana) Pencheva-Vulchanova was born 19 June 1947 in the town Sliven, Hungary, where she graduated from high school (1965) with honors. From 1964-1970 she studied architecture at Sofia Polytechnic. She began working (1971-1973) in Putproekt, the design organization of Sofia's administration of roads. During this time she designed several facilities, a motel in Ledenika, at the edge of Sofia, which has not been built, a technical school for construction workers in the town Mikhailovgrad, a vacation hotel that she designed in team with architect Tikholov, and housing for construction workers, also never built. In 1973 she transferred to Sofproekt, working first in the department for Sofia's master plan, and becoming the head of a studio in the department for Highways, in 1975.
</p>
      <p>Beginning in 1978 Vulchanova became involved in the planning and design of the neighborhood surrounding the National Palace of Culture. She designed shops on the bordering streets, including a cafeteria, winecellar and two bars, pedestrian passageways with commercial facilities and underground transportation facilities. In 1980, she became the head designer for the underground commercial center (7,500 sq. meters or 75,000-sq. ft. area) south of the Palace of Culture. This was built under the crossing of two major boulevards, "Bulgaria" and "Fritjof Nansen". Construction proceeded very slowly due to the heavy traffic circulation at the crossroads above. Some of the stores opened only in the 1990's.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Vulchanova designed several pedestrian passageways under major urban arteries, many of them with commercial facilities such as coffee shops, flower shops, liquor stores, etc.</p>
      <p>In 1984, she became head designer for another underground shopping center at the beginning of a new tramway connecting the city center with several large housing neighborhoods at the periphery ("Mladost", "Durvenitsa", and "Iztok"). This terminal was located underground close to the beginning of the large park in Sofia. The design included commercial spaces and entertainment covering 12,000 sq. meters (120,000 sq. ft). In 1985 when all the interior details were ready and construction began, the project was stopped for lack of funds.</p>
      <p>Jana (Zhana) Pencheva-Vulchanova's projects have been publicized in architectural periodicals and in the press. She has received the award of the Union of Architects in Bulgaria for her creative achievements in architecture and the golden Order of Labor for her contributions to urban design.</p>
