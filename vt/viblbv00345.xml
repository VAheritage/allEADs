<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Henry Courtenay Selden, son of Robert C. and Courtenay Brooke Selden, was born in Virginia on May 3, 1846. A resident of Gloucester County, Virginia, Selden had eight siblings (many of whom are mentioned in his letters): John, Charles, Robert Jr., Elizabeth, Warner, Mary, Charlotte, and Susan. By  1861, Selden was a student at Washington College (now Washington &amp; Lee University), where he remained through spring 1863. He enlisted the 3rd Virginia Cavalry later that year and died on September 23, 1864.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection contains color photocopies and typed transcripts of letters written by Henry Courtenay Selden, a student at Washington College (now Washington &amp; Lee University) during the Civil War. Writing from Lexington, Virginia to his sister Mollie (probably Mary Byrd Selden Dimmock), Selden discusses his schoolwork, family members, and local acquaintances but also mentions war news and rumors. In his letter of May 18, 1863, Selden briefly describes the funeral of Brigadier General Elisha F. Paxton, then recounts in detail the funeral procession and burial of General Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson. Included among the Washington College letters is a letter from A. L. Nelson, professor of mathematics, recommending Selden for an appointment in the Confederate Navy. The collection also includes a single letter written by Selden after his enlistment in the 3rd Virginia Cavalry. Writing from Brucetown, Virginia on August 30, [1864], Selden briefly mentions the regiment's recent battles at Williamsport and Smithfield.
