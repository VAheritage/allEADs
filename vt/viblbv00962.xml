            <p>Oscar Van Houten was born about 1836 in New Jersey. He married Julia Louisa Chandler(?). During the Civil War, he fought with the 9th New Jersey Infantry, first as a private. He was later promoted to and mustered out as Quartermaster Sergeant. After the war, he returned to New Jersey and worked for some time as a book keeper. He and his wife had at least two children: Jessie Francis (b. 1872) and George Dexter (b. 1873).</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The collection consists of a letter, dated May 17th 1863, written to Van Houten's father. He begins letter with a description of his "splendid camp" located "about 1/2 mile from the [Potomac Creek]." Altogether Van Houten surmises that "Virginia is a beautiful country...[but] in this winter is the most dreary place." Following the musings on scenery and camp life, Van Houten relates the events of his "last battle." He and his regiment, on the 29th of April, "went down to the river a little below Fredericksburg and opened on the enemy." After days of fighting, Van Houten's group lost three men--one of which was his "old friend" Ralph Buckley. Van Houten includes a detailed description of the wounds of several fellow soldiers. In a faded addition to the letter, Van Houten explains why he thinks he is fit for a promotion.</p>
