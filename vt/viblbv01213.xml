            <p>Lieutenant Colonel A. P. Porter was the chief commissary of subsistence of the Fifth Army Corps, a member of the Army of the Potomac. He was promoted from Captain to Lieutenant Colonel sometime between the 18th and 21st of August, 1862. Acting with Captain George Bell and other prominent figures in the Union Army, Porter aided in the rationing of goods, establishment of depot sites, discharge of vessels, and construction of temporary wharves. He communicated via letters with other commissaries and army divisions in the region to send rations to such areas as Yorktown, Rockville, and other stations across the states of Virginia and Maryland.</p>

            <p>This collection consists of a copybook containing about 280 letters written by Lieutenant Colonel A. P. Porter of the Union Army's Commissary of Subsistence. The letters include documentation about the shipping, maintenance, and distribution of large quantities of food and supply rations among the Union Army. Along with the transport and distribution of supplies, Porter also documented inventories of many resources including cattle, livestock, and other food supplies. Many of these letters are written to other Union officers including Col. A. Beckwith and Col. H. Clarke while Lieutenant Colonel Porter was stationed at General McClellan's Headquarters.</p>
