            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Born in Albany (Bibb County), Georgia on December 2, 1860, Marbury Johnston was the son of Thomas H. and Lamara Hill Johnston. After graduating from the U. S. Naval Academy in 1882, Johnston was assigned to the USS <title render="italic">Yantic</title> In 1883, he was transferred to the USS <title render="italic">Swatara</title>. The following year, Johnston was promoted to ensign and transferred to the training ship USS <title render="italic">Portsmouth</title>. In 1887, Johnston was assigned to the Fish Commission Steamer USS <title render="italic">Albatross</title>, a research vessel. After three years on the <title render="italic">Albatross</title>, he was transferred to the Office of Naval Intelligence, where he served for a year, then served two years on the USS <title render="italic">Concord</title>. Promoted to lieutenant, junior grade in 1894, he spent the next few years under various assignments (the USS <title render="italic">R. S. Franklin</title>, the War College and Torpedo School, the <title render="italic">San Francisco</title>, the <title render="italic">New Orleans</title>, and the <title render="italic">Cassius</title>) before being placed in command of the <title render="italic">Nero</title> in 1899. He served a year aboard the <title render="italic">Prairie</title> as executive officer; then in quick succession, he served aboard the <title render="italic">Vermont</title>, the <title render="italic"> Columbia</title>, the <title render="italic">Dolphin</title> and the <title render="italic"> Montgomery</title>.</p>
            <p>In 1902, Johnston was assigned as assistant to the U. S. minister at La Guyara, Venezuela. Six months later, he became naval attache at Caracas, Venezuela, a post in which he served for six months. Returning to Washington, D. C., Johnston was promoted to lieutenant commander and given command of the Second Torpedo Flotilla. From 1907 to 1908, he again served aboard the <title render="italic">Albatross</title>, this time as the ship's commander. His command was transferred to the USS <title render="italic"> Galveston</title> in 1908. The following year, Johnston was assigned to Navy Yard Puget Sound, and in 1910, he became captain of the Navy Yard at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The following year, Johnston was promoted to captain and placed in command of the USS <title render="italic">Georgia</title>. In 1913, Johnston attended a long course at the Naval War College. In 1914, he reported for duty as commandant of the New Orleans Navy Yard and Station, a post in which he served until 1917, when he was given command of a patrol force, and soon thereafter was placed in command of the Atlantic Fleet's Squadron 2, Cruiser Force, and promoted to rear admiral. From 1918 to 1921, he served as commandant of the 15th Naval District, adjacent to the Panama Canal Zone. In the latter year, Johnston became director of naval communications and president of the Naval Examining and Retiring Board, the post at which he served until his retirement in 1924.</p>
            <p>A lifelong bachelor, Johnston by 1930 was living with his sister and brother-in-law, Rebecca and Robert Toombs in Randolph County, Georgia. Marbury Johnston died on March 15, 1934, and was buried in Riverside Cemetery, Macon, Georgia.</p>
            <p>In 1930, Johnston was living with his sister, Rebecca, and her husband, Robert E. Toombs.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection contains the papers of Marbury Johnston, a career officer in the United States Navy during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Half of the collection consists of Johnston's official naval records, including orders and personnel records, chronicling Johnston's assignments and promotions, beginning with his 1878 appointment as a cadet midshipman at the U. S. Naval Academy and ending with his retirement in 1924. Accompanying these personnel records is a brief chronology of Johnston's life and career.</p>
            <p>Comprising the other half of the collection is a book draft by Johnston, titled "The Recollections of Another Naval Officer." The draft chronicles in detail Johnston's personal experiences during his 40-plus years in the U. S. Navy, commencing with his admission to the Naval Academy. The draft seems to be incomplete, with the narrative ending around 1917. A middle portion of the draft is in typescript form; the remainder is in Johnston's hand. Though the narrative touches on some of the larger issues facing the U. S. Navy during Johnston's years in service, the focus is largely on his personal experiences. As Johnston mentions in his introduction, "Any one seeking a weighty article on the changes in the Navy, or a dissertation on the Sampson - Schley, Daniels Sims controversies may look elsewhere."</p>
            <p>The collection also contains a photograph of the USS <title render="italic">Indianapolis</title> and a musical program from the HMS <title render="italic"> Emperor of India</title>.</p>
