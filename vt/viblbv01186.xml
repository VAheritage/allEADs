Consisting of both appointed and ex-officio members, the board was empowered to select the president and faculty, determine salaries, handle all matters of discipline and student life, and be responsible for all property of the College.</p><p>Governor Gilbert C. Walker appointed the first board on March 19, 1872, the day he signed the bill creating the college, and the first meeting was held March 25 and 26 in Richmond. Board appointments are still made by the governor and subject to confirmation by the Virginia Senate. Since its inception, the board has been chaired by a Rector. </p><p>Various changes have occurred throughout the years concerning the composition of the board, primarily relating to number and qualifications of appointees and offices to be represented ex-officio. The first board was composed of nine appointed members, with the president of the State Agricultural Society and members of the State Board of Education serving ex-officio. The next year, the makeup was changed so only the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and the president of the Agricultural Society served ex-officio. Later, the president of the Agricultural Society was eliminated as an ex-officio member, but the State Superintendent of Public Instruction remained until 1966. The president of the Board of Agriculture and Immigration (now Consumer Services) became an ex-officio member after 1902, now being the only ex-officio member serving with thirteen appointed members. Four non-voting members have been added to represent the faculty, staff, graduate students, and undergraduate students.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_3efd9e81347dcd61c31e039aa7fcfc6b"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>May include Bylaws; Citations for Meritorious Service [see also RG 6/4/3a]; William H.

The first Commandant of Cadets was General J.H. Lane, appointed in 1872. Commandants have been appointed by the Board of Visitors since that time, except for 1880-1881 when the Board failed to appoint either a Commandant or a president, so the acting president appointed a senior cadet as acting Commandant. In 1966, this post was put under the Dean of Students (later Vice President of Student Affairs) [RG 8]. </p><p>From 1908 to 1964, a president of the Corps was elected each year. This individual's primary responsibility was to serve as chairman of the Cadet Senate. The first constitution of the Corps was adopted in 1908. Both civilian and cadet units served under this single constitution until 1916 when a Unified Student Body was formed (now the Student Government Association) [RG 31/16].</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_d81dd5df141272665b7de855673306da"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>May include R.O.T.C.; Air R.O.T.C.; Armistice Day; Cadet Honor Court; Campus Man of the Year, 1960; Coat of Arms; Color Guard; Commissions; Student organizations and publications: Angel Flight; Army Blades; Arnold Air Society [see also RG 31/5]; Association of the U.

From 1944 through 1951, the Virginia General Assembly required students in home economics to spend their first two years at Radford College, the Women's Division of VPI. However, the Board of Visitors did not authorize a separate department at the Blacksburg campus until 1958. Two years later the Departments at Radford and Blacksburg were merged to become the School of Home Economics.
