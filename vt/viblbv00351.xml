<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company was formed in 1896 from the reorganization of the Norfolk and Western Railroad, which had been forced into receivership the previous year. With corporate offices in Roanoke, Virginia, the N&amp;W grew steadily through the twentieth century. The railway consolided with a number of other lines and became a major carrier in the East and Midwest, operating routes from Norfolk, Virginia as far west as Kansas City, Missouri. In 1982, the N&amp;W merged with the  Southern Railway to form the Norfolk Southern Corporation.
