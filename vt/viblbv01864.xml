      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Founded in 1898, the National Biscuit Company was the product of a merger among the
        American Biscuit and Manufacturing Company, the New York Biscuit Company, and the United
        States Baking Company. The new conglomerate consisted of one hundred-fourteen bakeries
        across the United States and was headquartered in New York City. </p>
      <p>Though the name "Nabisco" was first used as the name for a specific product introduced in
        1901 (a sugar wafer), and was used within the company at least as early as the 1930s (likely
        sooner), the corporate name was not shortened to Nabisco, Inc. until 1971. </p>
      <p>In 1981, Nabisco merged with Standard Brands, Inc., which later became part of R. J.
        Reynolds. It has since become part of several more mergers and separations. It is currently
        a subsidiary of Mondelēz International.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The National Biscuit Company Salesman's Collection consists of materials for the use of
        National Biscuit Company salesman, including blank order forms, a student's training guide,
        and a package catalog. Although none of the materials are dated, they may date from about
        the 1930s. possibly earlier. The order forms and student record book are empty, but a pasted
        in newspaper at the back of the packaging catalog suggests this may have been used by a
        salesman in Maine. </p>
      <p>The catalog contains sample packaging for a range of products, as well as examples of
        different kinds of racks to present the products in store. The order forms are all unused,
        but have space for quantities, products, prices, and include a note on the use of display
        covers. The "student salesman's progress record" appears to have been a training tool. It
        walks through the company's training program, guided by the National Biscuit Company logo,
        and consists mainly of questions to be answered by trainees on the company, products, raw
        materials, processes, advertising, and even the use of forms.</p>
