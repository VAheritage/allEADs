      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>James Edward Yates was born to Benjamin and Mary Yates in Culpeper County, Virginia, on
        January 24, 1826. By 1860, Yates was living in Rappahannock County, Virginia, where he
        worked as a cattle dealer. He married Mary Elizabeth Moore in Rappahnnock County on March
        19, 1868. The marriage record notes that Yates, a widower, was working as a cattle trader. A
        50-year-old J. E. Yates is listed as a stock dealer living in Flint Hill (Rappahannock
        County) in the 1880 census. Among others in the household is Yates's wife, Betty; children
        Charlie, Edward M., and Lizzie; and Yates's mother-in-law, Betsy Moore. James E. Yates died
        on January 21, 1918, and is buried in Rappahannock County's Flint Hill Methodist Cemetery.
        (Mrs. A. A. Yates (1829-1867), also buried in this cemetery, was likely Yates's first wife,
        as a stock dealer named James Yates married Adaline Amanda Swain in Rappahannock County in
        1859; in the 1880 census, Harriett Swain, Yates's mother-in-law, is listed among the
        inhabitants of his household.)</p>
