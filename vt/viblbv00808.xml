            <p>Sarah Pitts, born 20 May 1902 in Clinton, SC, was the daughter of John H. and Jane C.
                Pitts. A graduate of Landers College and George Peabody College, she started working
                for the Virginia Cooperative Extension service in 1929 and was Home Demonstration
                Agent in Prince William County from 1930-36. Following her marriage in 1935 to J.
                Benjamin Johnson Jr., she had to resign her position with Extension, as was the
                custom of the time.</p>
            <p>Maude E. Wallace, raised on a farm near Pontiac, IL, attended Illinois Women's
                College, Lewis Institute, and Columbia University. She came to Virginia in 1918 to
                participate in the Extension Service food conservation program. After 10 years as an
                assistant home demonstration agent in North Carolina, she returned to Virginia in
                1929 as state home demonstration agent for the Agricultural Extension Service at
                Virginia Tech. In 1938, she became Assistant Director of Extension for home
                demonstration, a position she held until her retirement in 1958. In 1937, Ms.
                Wallace served as head of the Home Economics department at the university, and for
                two years was both department head and state agent. She died on 5 December 1972.
                Wallace Hall on the Virginia Tech campus is named in her honor.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content note</head>
            <p>This letter was written by Maude E. Wallace of Virginia Agricultural Extension
                Service, Blacksburg, VA, to Sarah Pitts of George Peabody College, Nashville, TN, on
                14 August 1929. Ms. Pitts had been hired to work as an Extension agent, but had not
                yet begun her duties. The letter was written in response to an earlier letter in
                which Ms. Pitts asked for information about her upcoming position. Among the topics
                are: the county in which she might be placed, beginning as an assistant agent;
                salary; requirement to have a car; and probable start date. A further response from
                Ms. Pitts is written on the back of the second page of the letter in which she
                follows with several additional inquiries.</p>
