            <p>Jefferson Davis, the candidate for president, was born on June 3, 1808, in Kentucky.
                He died in 1889. He graduated from West Point military academy in 1828 and then
                served the US army in the frontier service. After resigning in 1835, Davis pursued a
                political career in which he was a Mississippi senator from 1835 to 1845, and a
                congressman. In 1861, when Mississippi seceded, Davis resigned from the senate and
                became the provisional president of the Confederate States. On February 22, 1862,
                Davis was elected as the president of the Confederacy. </p>
            <p>A. H. Stephens, the candidate for vice president, was born on February 11th, 1812, in
                Georgia. In 1832, he graduated from the University of Georgia at Athens. Before he
                was elected as the vice president for the Confederacy, he served both as a
                representative and senator for US Congress. After the Civil War, he served as a
                senator for Georgia until his death in 1883. </p>
            <p>John R. Edmunds, candidate for Virginia state representative, lived from 1807 to
                1874. He was educated at University of Virginia and William &amp; Mary and was a
                slave-owning farmer, lawyer, and legislator. </p>
            <p>Allen T. Caperton of Monroe, candidate for Virginia state representative, was born on
                November, 21, 1810 and died in 1876. In addition to serving as a member of the
                Confederate States Senate, he was a congressman for the US before and after the
                Civil War. </p>
