      <head>Biographical Note: Eleanor Copenhaver Anderson (1896-1985)</head>
      <p>Eleanor Gladys Copenhaver (1896-1985) was born on June 15, 1896 in Marion, Virginia, to
        Bascom Eugene and Laura Lu Scherer Copenhaver. Laura Lu's father founded Marion Female
        College, which was located next door to the family home, "Rosemont." Laura Lu attended
        Marion College and later taught English there. Her husband, B.E. Copenhaver, first taught at
        Marion and then became Smyth County superintendent of schools. Eleanor Copenhaver attended
        Marion College, then Westhampton College in Richmond, completing a B. A. in English in 1917.
        After spending a year teaching and time as a camp director, she spent more than ten years
        working for the YWCA, specializing first in rural community organizing and later in
        industrial communities. During this time, she met and eventually married Sherwood Anderson
        in 1933. </p>
      <p>From 1937 to 1947 Copenhaver Anderson was head of the National YWCA's Industrial Program,
        later accepting a 2 year assignment abroad. In 1950, she spent a brief time apart from the
        YWCA, after it ended programs for employed women, but she was re-hired in 1951 for another
        ten years for the YWCA and United Community Defense Services, until she retired in 1961. </p>
      <p>She spent her later life in both New York City and at “Rosemont” and “Ripshin” in Virginia.
        As the collection suggests, she maintained an active role in scholarship surrounded Sherwood
        Anderson. She died on September 12, 1985, in Marion, Virginia. </p>

      <head>Biographical Note: James T. Farrell (1904-1979)</head>
      <p>James T. Farrell was but in Chicago, Illinois, in 1904. Raised in Chicago, he eventually
        attended the University of Chicago from 1925 to 1929. He left school without graduating,
        however, and took up a career as a writer. In the first half of the 1930s, he authored the
          <title render="italic">Studs Lonigan</title> trilogy. This trilogy led to a series of
        works written between 1936 and 1953. In 1958, he began another series, intended to be 25
        books in length, of which Farrell completed ten. Over the course of his 47+ year career, he
        wrote 25 novels and 17 collections of short stories. A number of additional works were
        published posthumously. Farrell died in New York, New York, in August of 1979.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection contains four letters written by author James Farrell to Eleanor Copenhaver
        Anderson between February 1952 and May of 1954. The two had some on-going correspondence of which
        this represents only a small piece. As the letters suggest, one thing the two had in common
        was social activism--at various points in time, both worked for and supported various rights
        and activist causes. The April 8th letter is primarily concerned with Farrell's updates
        about contacts in the UAW and his efforts to help Anderson get a job with them, if she was
        interested. It appears she was not, as she was re-hired by her previous employer, the YWCA,
        in 1951, and she remained with the organization until 1961. The third and fourth letters are
        more about a piece Farrell wrote on Sherwood Anderson, his influence on Farrell, and
        Farrell's own writing at the time.</p>
