            <p>James Kirkpatrick, age 33 at the time of the 1860 census, was born in Ohio. Described
                as a merchant in 1860 with an estate valued at $13,500, he lived in Clayton, IL with
                his wife, Elizabeth, age 31, whom he married in 1848, and four children, William,
                age 11; Mary, age 9; Albert H., age 7; Warren (later John W.), age 2. He entered the
                war as a first lieutenant with Company C of the Third Missouri Cavalry and was
                promoted to Captain prior to Dec. 1863. The Official Army Register of the Volunteer
                Force of the United States for the Years 1861, 62, 63, 64, 65, lists him among
                "Casualties, Resigned" with the date 12 August 1864. The regiment was organized at
                Palmyra and St. Louis, Missouri from 15 October 1861 to 6 March 1862 and saw duty
                largely in southeast Missouri and Arkansas. Following the war, Kirkpatrick returned
                to Illinois and is identified in the 1870 census as a farmer and miller with an
                estate valued at over $17,000. In addition to his wife, Elizabeth, two more children
                are listed, John F., age 3, and Sallie, age 5. The 1880 census adds Emma, then age
                9. By 1900, Elizabeth, age 70, is shown as head of a household that includes only
                two lodgers, though her status is "married" rather than "widowed."</p>
            <p>William Kirkpatrick appears in the 1870 census, a member of his parents' household,
                with the occupation of farmer.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The James Kirkpatrick Letters contains two letters from Captain James Kirkpatrick of
                Company C, Third Missouri Cavalry. The first, dated, 14 December 1863, is written
                from Company Headquarters in Jacksonport, Arkansas to his wife, Elizabeth, who is
                home in Clayton, Adams County, Illinois. The second letter, dated 21 June 1864, is
                written from a camp near Little Rock, Arkansas, to his eldest son, William, age
                approx. 15 years-old, who is serving with the 137th Regiment, Illinois Infantry near
                Memphis, Tennessee. While the first tells of entering Jacksonport after a brief
                fight, and matters of health, rations, and exchanging letters from home, the second
                is largely a warning from father to son to avoid the vices and temptations of camp
                life. The letters are accompanied by their original envelopes. Two other envelopes
                (only), both from apparently from James Kirkpatrick, complete the collection. These
                are Illinois and Mississippi Telegraph envelopes, one addressed to Mrs. E.
                Kirkpatrick; the other to an H. R. Matley [?] of Clayton, Illinois.</p>
