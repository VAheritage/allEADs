      <p>Kendall W. King (1926-1990) was the son of Hilda Bainton King of Kennett Square,
            Pennsylvania and Charles Glen King, a widely known biochemist and former professor at
            the University of Pittsburgh. He had two siblings, a brother, Robert D. King, M.D.,
            Chancellor's Distinguished Service Professor of Neurological Surgery at Upstate Medical
            University, and a sister, Mrs. Dorothy Hammel. Kendall King married Kathleen Abbitt
            (later Young), who graduated from Virginia Tech in the class of 1947, and they had two
            children, Russell and Virginia. He received B.S. (class of 1949) and M.S. degrees from
            Virginia Tech and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>King was a member of Virginia Tech's faculty for 15 years. He had a split appointment in
            biology and biochemistry and nutrition, but he transferred entirely to the Department of
            Biochemistry and Nutrition shortly after R. W. Engel came to Virginia Tech to head the
            new department in 1952. King served as department head from 1966 to 1968. He helped
            develop the new department's curriculum, generated more than $1 million in teaching and
            research grants, andhelped start its study abroad program. King pioneered work in how
            complex carbohydrates are digested by microorganisms, but he was most noted for his
            pioneering work in Haiti, establishing the Mothercraft Center concept. He served as
            consultant to the U.S. Agency for International Development and World Health
            Organization, establishing similar programsin other nations.</p>
      <p>In 1986 he joined the Research Coporation, a New York foundation for scientific
            research, as assistant vice president for grants. He becamae vice president in 1977 with
            full responsibility for planning and managing the corporation's $6 million annual grants
            program. That program became a major source for basic research funds for liberal arts
            colleges. He also administreed the corporation's research and traning project in public
            health and nutrition in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
      <p>From 1983 to 1986, King was vice president of Remick Associates, a chemical,
            pharmaceutical, and microelectronics recruiting firm. In 1986 he became associate dean
            at Western Carolina University (WCU) with princial responsibilities in research
            addministration. He worked closely with WCU's international educational and technical
            assistance projects and started the university's first scholarship fund for
            international students. He died in 1990 at age 64.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Kendall W. King (1926-1990) Papers span the years 1959 to 2000 (bulk 1960-1979) The
            collection includes materials on cellulase, Mothercraft Centers,nutrition in Haiti,
            nutrition an meeting world food needs, and miscellaneous professionaland personal
            papers.</p>
      <p>Two reports on celluslase concern King's pioneering work on how complex carbohydrates
            are digested by microorganisms. The reports deal with the shortcomings of of cellulose
            and cellulose substrates for studying the mechanism of cellulose action and the the site
            of attack on substrate by cellulose.</p>
      <p>The collection includes front matter and six chapters of King's manuscript, "Mothercraft
            Centers and the Malnourished Child," as well as reports, speeches, guidelines, and
            publications by King and others, including several reports by Ivan D. Beghin.
            Mothercraft or Nutritional Rehabilitation Centers aimed to educate mothers about how to
            feed and care for infants and young children using techniques compatible with their
            understanding and financial limitations. In developing countries, pre-school children
            are most vulnerable to restrictions in the food supply and, therefore, the group in
            which malnutrition is most serious.</p>
      <p>King did pioneering work in Haiti establishing the Mothercraft Center concept and did
            research for the Haiti project at Virginia Tech. He began his work in Haiti in 1958 when
            he served on a nutrition survey investigating the nutritional status of the Haitian
            people. In 1959 to 1960 he lead a nutritional research project in Haiti. The collection
            includes reports and publications about appraisal of nutrition in Haiti and efforts to
            ameliorate malnutrition in children through research and Mothercraft Centers.</p>
      <p>The papers contain United Nations' publications, reports, and guides from 1977-1979 on
            world hunger, family nutrition programs, and food and nutrition appraisal, research,
            education, and policies. Topices include efforts to combat malnutrtion in pre-school
            children, the place of vegetables in meeting the food needs of emerging nations,
            community action, and United Nations' nutrition policies and programs.</p>
      <p>Correspondence in the collection is primarily with publishers about the Mothercraft
            Center manuscript (1972-1982). Other correspondence relates to the King scholarship
            fund. The collection also contains Warren H. Strother's interview with King, materials
            by King on generating research grants and evaluating faculty, poems by King, "Dr.
            Kendall King Memorial Address" by Frederick W. Harrison, and a "Resolution in Memory of
            Dr. Kendall King," adopted by the Council on Research of the University of North
            Carolina.</p>
