        soldier William Moore, Private, Company E, 27th Kentucky Infantry. Letters primarily detail
        Moore's desire to return home and concerns over both his and his wife's health. An
        additional two letters by Capt. J.R. Robinson concern Moore's poor health and his subsequent

      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Moore lists himself as of the BG William "Bull" Nelson Division, Col. William B. Hazen
        Brigade, Col. C.D. Pennebaker Regiment, Company E. Matching this with the Civil War Soldiers
        system places him as a private in the 27th Kentucky Infantry. While Moore does not mention
        it, he likely saw combat at Shiloh shortly before he died of disease (likely dysentery). </p>
      <p>Family records show that William Moore died on June 15, 1862, which is confirmed by Capt.
        Robinson's letter. Moore's wife Lydia died on July 18, 1862 according to the same family
        records. They were survived by their infant daughter Harriet who was born on January 23,
        1861, and adopted by relatives.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a">
      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>During the time period of interest, Moore travels with the Army of the Ohio from around
        Elizabethtown, Kentucky, to around Corinth, Mississippi, with many other stops along the
        way. Moore's regiment participated in the Battle of Shiloh in April.</p>
      <p>Moore writes on February 7, 1862: "…we think that it won't be long before peace will be
        made and I will return back to my old home Again." He notes a sermon and church attendance
        in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, on February 2, 1862. Despite the longing and belief that he will
        return home, Moore foreshadows his death as he urges his wife to attend church so they will
        meet in heaven if he dies. He asks if there is word from the family of William Coils
        (Private, 159th New York Infantry, Company E) and Chesslys Rogers (possible Chester?)</p>
      <p>Moore claims to be feeling ill March 7. He still feels the war will end soon. "I must close
        my leter by saying remember your dare husband until death." In the April 1 letter to Moore
        insists his brother comes to see him at camp because Moore has some "very importance
        business" with him. This letter also contains notes to his wife to go to the doctor to get
        medicine; clearly Moore is aware his wife is also ill. Moore has relocated to Camp Shiloh by
        his April 27 letter and claims that he is no longer ill. He mostly discusses money and
        longing for home, as well as a mention of passing through a battlefield and seeing the
        dead.</p>
      <p>Captain Robinson's letter claims Moore boarded a steamboat in Hamburg, Tennessee, bound for
        Kentucky but died before it left harbor. Moore was stationed at a camp near Corinth,
        Mississippi, from May 15 onward. Moore contracted some sort of illness, making him very
        weak, and was taken to a hospital with a group on June 3. For the next several weeks,
        Robinson was ordered to march south 25-30 miles. Because of this, he did not know of Moore's
        death until returning to camp and was unable to send Moore's remains home for a proper
        burial. </p>
      <p>Note that if the family records are correct, Captain Robinson's notification of Moore's
        death never reached Moore's wife as she had already died.</p>
