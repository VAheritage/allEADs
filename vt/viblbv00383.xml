<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>In February of 1868, the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee passed &quot;An Act to secure the loyal citizens of Tennessee recompense from the United States government for losses incurred by the Rebellion.&quot; A claim had a list of requirements, including the need for a signed statement the claimant was loyal to the Union and had never assisted the Confederate army, signatures of two witnesses swearing to the person's loyalty, witness statements to the acts of damage or theft, and the signature of a military of government official to vouch for the claimant and witnesses.
</p><p>On May 20, 1868, Elizabeth Hughes filed a claim (numbered &quot;No 6&quot;) for the loss of property stolen, including a horse and wagon, bushels of wheat, and sides of leather. The claim also contains notice of a fire, set by Confederate soldiers, in which Hughes lost &quot;all of [her] house hold. Kitchen Furniture[,] some valuable Papers, and many other articles too tedious to mention.&quot; The total claim amounts to more than $1400. The identity of the unit(s) involved is not known. Signatures include those of witnesses, county and state officials, and the governor. Hughes' signatures come in the form of her mark, attested to in each case. </p></scopecontent>
