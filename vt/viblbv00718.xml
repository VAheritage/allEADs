            <p>Col. James Francis Preston was born in Virginia and was educated at West Point
                Military Academy. He volunteered in the Mexican War and both equipped and organized
                his company completely at his own expense. While serving the Union army during the
                Civil War, he died of exposure in 1862. His wife, Sarah Caperton Preston, was from
                Elmwood, Monroe County, West Virginia.</p>
            <p>Hugh Caperton Preston was the son of James Francis and Sarah Caperton Preston. He was
                born on September 5, 1856 in Elmwood, West Virginia. In 1877, he graduated as a
                senior Captain from Virginia Military Institute. Afterwards, he managed his mother’s
                estate (White Thorn) in Montgomery County, Virginia until he sold it in 1892. Hugh
                then moved to East Radford and pursued real-estate and insurance business as well as
                serving two terms as Mayor. In the Spanish American War, Hugh served in Company M of
                Virginia’s 4th Volunteer Infantry, stationed in Cuba. He then served in the 31st US
                Volunteer Company in the Philippines, where he was promoted to the rank of 1st
                Lieutenant. On April 30, 1878, Hugh married Miss Cary Marx Baldwin; they had seven
                children together. In 1901, Hugh and his wife returned to East Radford, where he
                then worked in the real-estate business for the rest of his life.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>This collection consists of two letters.</p>
            <p>The first letter is dated on July 28, 1861 and is written by James Francis Preston to
                his wife, Sarah Caperton Preston following the First Battle of Bull Run. He writes
                about the battle’s events and his own movements, including executing a direct order
                from General Jackson to charge the advancing enemy. In the beginning of his letter,
                James calls the battle a &quot;fearful sight.&quot;</p>
            <p>The second letter dates to May 15, 1872 and is written by Sarah Caperton Preston to
                Colonel Grabowski at Virginia Military Institute (VMI). The letter is a response to
                a previous notice from the Colonel about her son’s (Hugh Caperton Preston) recent
                failure to follow a senior student's order at VMI. Sarah passively defends her son,
                explaining why he might have disobeyed the order. She also expresses confusion at
                some of the Colonel's reasoning for her son's behavior. Additionally, Sarah
                expresses hope that her son will gain maturity with age and learn that, &quot;an officers
                commision will not always shield him.&quot;</p>
