            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>The Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of the New River Valley had its beginnings at a meeting held on the Virginia Tech campus in late 1955. Founded as the Blacksburg Unitarian Fellowship, the group was soon holding regular meetings in the student activities building and became a formally constituted fellowship in October, 1956. The fellowship in 1961 changed its name to the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of the New River Valley. In 1967, the fellowship built its own meeting house (a new meeting house would be built in 1992). After having been led by various laypersons and visiting ministers for decades, the fellowship installed its first part-time minister, Rev. William D. Main, in 1987. The fellowship would install its first full-time minister in 1999, and change its name to the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of the New River Valley in 2003.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection contains the records of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of the New River Valley, located in Blacksburg, Virginia. The collection includes printed materials, essays, and documents relating to the fellowship's congregation and its history. (Much of the collection consists of photocopies, rather than original materials.) Documenting the history of the fellowship are lists of former presidents and members, newspaper articles, and addresses by Wilhelmina Elarth and Paul and Jewell Field; fellowship activities are detailed in a set of programs and newsletters. The majority of the collection, however, consists of materials relating to the congregation's search for a minister in 1986. Included are a report of the search committee and a program for the installation of Rev. William D. Main. A notebook distributed to prospective ministers is included as well, and among its contents are essays on the fellowship's history, congregation, building, and by-laws, a budget report; community overviews; biographical sketches of the search committee; and the results of a congregational survey.</p>
