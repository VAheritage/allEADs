      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>James R. Tice, farm worker and Confederate soldier, was
         born in Floyd County, Virginia, the son of Laban and Frances Webb Tice. Although census records indicate that Tice was born around 1842, family members provide March 24, 1847 as his date of birth. He
         was the son of Laban and Frances Webb Tice. In 1860, Tice was
         living in Copper Hill (Floyd County), Virginia and working as
         a field hand. He enlisted in Company B of the 42nd Virginia
         Infantry at Jacksonville (now Floyd), Virginia on May 25, 1861, with the initial rank of first
         corporal. Through successive promotions, he eventually
         attained the rank of third sergeant and was present with the
         company until December 1862, when he was briefly detailed to
         Floyd County to find absentee soldiers. Tice was wounded in
         the back and captured at the battle of Gettysburg. He died
         there from his wounds on July 6, 1863.</p>
      <p>Company B of the 42nd Virginia Infantry was mustered into
         Confederate service at Lynchburg on June 11, 1861. The
         regiment had been recruited from counties in south central
         Virginia and would participate in Jackson's Shenandoah Valley
         campaign of 1862. The regiment later fought at Gettysburg, The
         Wilderness, Spotsylvania and in Early's Valley Campaign of
         1864, before being assigned duty in the defense of Petersburg.
         The regiment was present at the surrender to Union forces in
         Appomattox.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The correspondence of James R. Tice, a Confederate soldier
         in Company B, 42nd Virginia Infantry, consist of three letters
         written to his sister (Martha A. Tice Light) and
         brother-in-law (Jim Light) during the war. Written from camps
         near Romney (January 18, 1862), Port Republic (June 15, 1862)
         and Guinea Station (April 21, 1863), the letters focus
         primarily upon personal and family matters. Brief mentions are
         made of the battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic, as well
         as the death of Turner Ashby. Tice discusses in somewhat
         greater detail the withdrawal of Union forces from Romney and
         the many provisions captured by the Confederates there. He
         also briefly discusses the war-time prices of various
         goods.</p>
