            <p>Walter Stephenson Newman was the 10th President of Virginia Tech from 1947-1962. He was the first vice-president of Virginia Tech. His presidency is often called the "era of good feeling." He is credited for developing Virginia Tech into a major university. Under his term, the university experienced growth in almost all areas. He worked to strengthen the humanities, social sciences and added graduate degrees.</p>
            <p>Newman was born in 1895 in Woodstock, Virginia to Walter and Sallie Newman. He got his Bachelor's degree from Hampton-Sydney, his master's from VPI and his Ph.D. from Penn State. He taught Vocational Agriculture in Windsor, Va., and later became an associate professor in vocational education at VPI. He served as state superintendent of vocational education and was the assistant superintendent of public instruction. He was a highly respected educator and was one of the founders of the Future Farmers of Virginia. He married Liz Otey Hoge in 1923 and had one son.</p>
