      <head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
      <p>Mattie Lamb was born January 26, 1893 near Blacksburg, Virginia. She attended school in Blacksburg and worked for the Pedigo family before marrying Arthur Bruce Tucker on September 29, 1918. Tucker served as a
volunteer with the Red Cross, a Gray Lady volunteer at the Veterans Administration hospital, and performed many social and volunteer services, such as organizing charity events for hospitalized veterans and blood
drives for the Red Cross. She also served as rehabilitation chairman for the Auxiliary Unit and was a prominent member of the Methodist Church of Blacksburg.
</p>
      <p>Arthur Bruce Tucker, was born on September 29, 1885. His first wife died in childbirth, leaving a son, William. With his father, Tucker worked on the Alexander Black farm for 40 years, until Black's death in
1935. Tucker then took a position with the Blacksburg post office, where he worked for another 20 years. Together, the Tuckers won hundreds of blue ribbons at county and community fairs. Many were won by Arthur
Tucker in horse shows in Roanoke, Lynchburg and other places in Virginia; others were won by Mattie Tucker for cooking and handicrafts. The Tuckers' son, Henry Kelly Tucker, was born May 12, 1925, and enlisted in
the Marine Corps in 1943; serving in the 5th Marine Division, he died in combat on Iwo Jima, March 1, 1945.
</p>
      <p>Mattie Tucker was so regarded by her social circle and the community that several children wrote about her in their class assignments as an "outstanding person." At their home at 209 Wharton Street, the Tuckers
also housed Virginia Polytechnic Institute students during their stay in Blacksburg. Mattie Tucker was dubbed a "Santa" by local veterans, whose lives she improved by organizing gift drives and fund raisers. She
was rewarded for her work and frequently featured in local newspapers. Mattie Tucker was also very active socially, organizing luncheons and parties for her circle of friends as well as the local elderly
community. She died on July 20, 1985; Arthur Tucker had died on August 16, 1967.
