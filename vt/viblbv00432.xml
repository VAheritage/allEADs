<p>The photograph's cardboard frame is labeled &quot;A.P. Snider, Marion, VA.&quot; A. (Andrew) P. Snider was born in Smyth County, Virginia, abt. 1879. He and his wife, Lena M., had a daughter, born abt. 1908, and a son, born abt. 1909. Although his family appears on the 1920 census, Snider himself does not.

<head>Scope and Content

<p>While this photograph is not labeled with a date or location, it depicts several men working at a quarry&ndash;possibly near Marion or Wytheville, Virginia. A.P. Snider was taking photographs during the first two decades of the twentieth century in Marion, which suggests that this photograph was likely taken between 1900 and 1920. </p>
