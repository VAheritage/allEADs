      <p>Alva Cleveland was born in Cherry Valley, New York, to Philo and Hannah (Miller)
                Cleveland, March 13, 1805. On January 24, 1831, he married Maria (Mary) Austin (b.
                1809), in Skaneateles, New York. They had eight children: Elvira (Alvira) (b.1832),
                Edwin (1834-1835), Elvin (Alvin) (1836-1854), Mary (b. 1839), Henry Harrison (b.
                1842), Emma (1844-1846), Sarah Maria (b. 1846), and George Washington (1849-1885).
                Between 1836 and 1840, the family moved to Cook County, Illinois. By 1849, they
                relocated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Cleveland appears to have worked for the United
                States Postal Service in Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>Cleveland and his two sons enlisted for Union service in the first years of the war.
                Cleveland, at the age of 56, enlisted with Company E, 1<emph render="super">st</emph> Regiment, Wisconsin Infantry, on October 23, 1861. He served as an
                orderly. George Washington Cleveland, who figures prominently in his father's diary,
                enlisted as a drummer with the same company at the age of 12. Alva Cleveland and his
                younger son were both discharged on November 8, 1862, due to an unspecified
                disability. Henry Harrison Cleveland mustered in with the 10<emph render="super">th</emph> Independent Battery, Wisconsin Light Infantry, August 19, 1862. He
                mustered out on June 7, 1865. Following his discharge, Alva Cleveland returned home
                to Wisconsin. He died between 1880 and 1885.</p>
      <p>The 1<emph render="super">st</emph> Regiment, Wisconsin Infantry organized at Camp
                Scott, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in October 1861. The regiment spent most of its service
                in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia. During the period Cleveland is writing, the
                regiment was predominantly around Nashville and Columbia, Tennessee. The regiment
                later went on to participate in a number of significant battles including
                Chattanooga, Chickamauga, and New Hope Church. Veterans and recruits transferred to
                the 21<emph render="super">st</emph> Regiment, Wisconsin Infantry in October 1864.
                The remainder of the unit mustered out. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection contains Alva Cleveland's diary from March to July 1862. In the back
                pocket of the diary are several sewing needles and a lock of brown hair. The diary
                does not indentify whose hair it is.</p>
      <p>Cleveland writes that he and George enlisted to "take up arms in defense of
                that liberty that our fathers fought to Establish (sic)." Due to his
                position as orderly, however, Cleveland appears to have done little actual fighting.
                He was most often at the rear of the regiment, tending to and assisting in moving
                the sick and wounded when the camp moved. He frequently writes of staying behind as
                the mobile portion of the regiment moves forward and, when they are separated, notes
                his concern for his young son.</p>
      <p>Cleveland's diary entries are lengthy narratives on camp life, moving camps and
                marches, records of letters and money sent to and from home, and most commmonly,
                stories of people he meets along the way. He tells detailed stories of positive and
                negative encounters with Union and Confederate supporters. Although Cleveland
                prvides some accounts of skirmishes, he does not record any particular battles or
                battle reports.</p>
