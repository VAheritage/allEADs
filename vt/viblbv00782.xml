            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>The city now known as Roanoke was founded as the town of Big Lick in 1852 and
                chartered under that name in 1874. Growth of the community was spurred when it
                became the the site of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway's junction with the
                Shenandoah Valley Railroad. Big Lick grew with the success of the railroad; the
                town's name was changed to Roanoke in 1882, and it was chartered as an independent
                city in 1884. By 1930, the city's population had reached sixty-nine thousand; by
                2000, the population of Roanoke had reached ninety-six thousand.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection consists of a single scrapbook, apparently compiled by officials of
                the city of Roanoke to promote Roanoke as the site of a proposed new Veterans
                Administration hospital in Southwest Virginia. The scrapbook, bearing the title
                "Roanoke, Virginia: Exhibits," describes the city's cultural, social, and economic
                advantages through descriptive essays, photographs, city reports, maps, and
                ephemera. It is divided into the following sections: Transportation, Climate,
                History and geography, Population, [Living conditions], Recreational facilities,
                Sanitation, [Costs], Hotels, Social services, Medical and hospital inventory, [City
                services], Utilities, [Schools and churches], and Locations. Among the printed
                materials assembled for the scrapbook are railroad timetables, restaurant menus,
                travel brochures, a VPI vs. VMI football program, a Roanoke College catalog, and the
                city's annual report and comprehensive plan. Photographs within the scrapbook
                include images of hotels, hospitals, parks, a theater, and other city scenes.</p>
