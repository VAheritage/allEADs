         <p>The Norfolk and Western Railway was organized in 1881 from
         the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Ohio Railroad. Primarily a line
         carrying agricultural products at its inception, the Norfolk
         and Western rapidly became associated with the mineral
         development of the southwestern part of Virginia and West
         Virginia. In 1881 it acquired the franchises to four other
         lines: the New River Railroad, the New River Railroad, Mining,
         and Manufacturing Company, the Bluestone Railroad, and the
         East River Railroad. These companies became the basis for
         Norfolk and Western's New River Division, which ran to the
         coalfields to the west.</p>
         <p>Much of the early history of the Norfolk and Western
         Railway can be written in terms of expansion and
         consolidation with other lines. In 1890, it acquired the
         Shenandoah Valley Railroad, which ran from Roanoke, Virginia,
         to Hagerstown, Maryland. By 1891, an Ohio extension was well
         underway, giving the railroad access to the industrial
         Midwest. In 1892, Norfolk and Western leased the Roanoke and
         Southern Railroad, connecting Roanoke with Winston-Salem,
         North Carolina, and in 1893 it leased the Lynchburg and
         Durham, connecting Lynchburg with Durham, North Carolina. But
         this program of expansion, coupled with the economic
         depression of the 1890s, forced the railroad into receivership
         in 1895. It emerged as the reorganized Norfolk and Western
         Railway the next year.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>The Norfolk and Western Railway Accounting Department Personnel Records are
         comprised of employee records of the company's accounting department from 1874 to 1907. The three ledgers include such information as employee name, age, marital status, date and place of birth, date of hire, jobs worked, and salary. Also included are notes regarding resignations or discharges. Interspersed throughout the ledgers are correspondence, memos and notes relating to such things as employment reference requests from other companies and employee infractions against company policies. <emph render="bold">It is important to note that these records relate <emph render="underline">only</emph> to personnel who worked within the company's accounting department. Special Collections does not hold any other Norfolk and Western personnel records.</emph></p>
