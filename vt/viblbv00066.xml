      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The Norfolk and Western Railway was organized in 1881 from the Atlantic, Mississippi,
            and Ohio Railroad. Primarily a line carrying agricultural products at its inception, the
            Norfolk and Western rapidly became associated with the mineral development of the
            southwestern part of Virginia and West Virginia. In 1881 it acquired the franchises to
            four other lines: the New River Railroad, the New River Railroad, Mining, and
            Manufacturing Company, the Bluestone Railroad, and the East River Railroad. These
            companies became the basis for Norfolk and Western's New River Division, which ran to
            the coalfields to the west.</p>
      <p>Much of the early history of the Norfolk and Western Railway can be written in terms of
            expansion and consolidation with other lines. In 1890, it acquired the Shenandoah Valley
            Railroad, which ran from Roanoke, Virginia, to Hagerstown, Maryland. By 1891, an Ohio
            extension was well underway, giving the railroad access to the industrial Midwest. In
            1892, Norfolk and Western leased the Roanoke and Southern Railroad, connecting Roanoke
            with Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and in 1893 it leased the Lynchburg and Durham,
            connecting Lynchburg with Durham, North Carolina. But this program of expansion, coupled
            with the economic depression of the 1890s, forced the railroad into receivership in
            1895. It emerged as the reorganized Norfolk and Western Railway the next year.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Norfolk and Western Railway Accounting Department Personnel Records are comprised of
            employee records of the company's accounting department from 1874 to 1907. The three
            ledgers include such information as employee name, age, marital status, date and place
            of birth, date of hire, jobs worked, and salary. Also included are notes regarding
            resignations or discharges. Interspersed throughout the ledgers are correspondence,
            memos and notes relating to such things as employment reference requests from other
            companies and employee infractions against company policies. <emph render="bold">It is
               important to note that these records relate <emph render="underline">only</emph> to
               personnel who worked within the company's accounting department. Special Collections
               does not hold any other Norfolk and Western personnel records.</emph></p>
