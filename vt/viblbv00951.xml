            <p>William Oscar Goodwin, proprietor of the W. O. Goodwin &amp; Company store at Glenvar (Roanoke County), Virginia, was born on January 14, 1873, the son of Thomas T. and Mattie Salome Coffman Goodwin.</p>
            <p>An article in the September 23, 1893 edition of the 
                <title render="italic">Roanoke Times</title> refers to W. O. Goodwin as an employee in the offices of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad. An article in the October 6, 1895 issue of the same newspaper states that Goodwin had been previously living for some time in Roanoke, Illinois but had recently returned to Roanoke County to live. The 1910 census lists 37-year-old Roanoke County resident William O. Goodwin as a messenger. He is described as a merchant in the 1920 census, however. According to his obituary, Goodwin established his store in 1913; Deedie Kagey's 
                <title render="italic">When Past is Prologue: a History of Roanoke County</title> states that Goodwin's store succeeded that of Frank P. Harmon in 1915. Evidence within the collection suggests that the former date is probably correct. Goodwin's obituary states that he operated the store until 1946.</p>
            <p>Goodwin married Xie Gullett, and the couple had five children. William Goodwin died in Staunton, Virginia on May 17, 1955, and was buried at Sherwood Burial Park, Salem, Virginia.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection contains two account books from W. O. Goodwin &amp; Company, a general mercantile store in Glenvar (Roanoke County), Virginia during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
            <p>Because the first account book seems to predate Goodwin's start in business by nearly two decades, it seems likely to have originated with his predecessor in business, Frank P. Harmon. This ledger records the names of individuals and other companies with whom business was transacted, together with dates and amounts of transactions. Purchases generally have not been itemized but described simply as "merchandise." Also recorded in brief detail are farm and family accounts. The account entries end in 1899, and are followed by what appears to be a list of Goodwin's expenditures for stock, beginning with his purchase of the store in 1913, and running through 1920. The second volume is a ledger detailing the transactions of a general mercantile business, with entries providing names of customers, itemized lists of purchases, prices, and dates.</p>
