      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The original Great Seal was commissioned by the Confederate States of America, likely in
        1863, from J.S. and A.B. Wyon, London, England, then Chief Engravers of Her Majesty's Seals.
        Reaching Richmond before the end of the war, the seal, as reported in the <title
          render="italic">New York Times</title> (21 May 1912), was removed from the city during the
        evacuation of April 1865 by William J. Bromwell, chief clerk of the Confederate State
        Department. By 1872, it was in the possession of John T. Pickett, formerly a Colonel in the
        Confederate army and then a lawyer in Washington D.C. and Thomas O. Selfridge, a U.S. naval
        officer. Pickett, reportedly, had 100 electrotype copies made, possibly by George Massamore,
        numismatist of Baltimore. Seventy-five were made of copper and twenty-five of silver over
        copper. The original seal was returned to Selfridge, who remained in possession of it until
        he sold it in 1912 to a group of Richmond businessmen. It now resides in Richmond at the
        Museum of the Confederacy. </p>
      <p>One of the copies made for Pickett was presented by him in 1874 to Wyon, the engravers of
        the original seal, for authentication, as described in the document that accompanies the
        seal in this collection. The seal itself is one of the silver on copper electrotype
        copies.</p>

      <head>Content Description</head>
      <p>One of one hundred electrotype replica copies made from the original Great Seal of the
        Confederate States of American in the early 1870s. Of the hundred, 75 were made of copper
        and 25, as is the case with this example, are silver over copper. The original seal was
        produced for the CSA in 1864 by J. A. and A. B. Wyon, London, Chief Engravers of Seals for
        the British Monarchy. Accompanying the seal is a letter of authentication from Wyon dated 6
        March 1874, verifying the authenticity of the impression as a faithful reproduction of the
        original. The Seal is held in its original gutta percha box.</p>
