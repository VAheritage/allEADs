<p>The Norfolk &amp; Western Railway and Associated Companies Collection was purchased by Special Collections in 2009. The collection had been part of a larger group of railroad-related materials compiled by a collector, then sold to a dealer (see "separated material" section). Also purchased separately in 2009 and added to the collection was the printed item titled "Alphabetical-numerical List of Sidings and Team Tracks within Roanoke Terminal Switching Limits."

<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The Norfolk &amp; Western Railway was established through a reorganization of the bankrupt Norfolk and Western Railroad in 1896, the latter company itself having arisen from the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad, a successor to the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad. Through expansion and various mergers, the N&amp;W grew to become a major U.S. carrier, serving 14 states. The company manufactured steam locomotives at its own Roanoke Machine Works (established in Roanoke, Virginia in 1882), and among the railroad's affiliated holdings were several hotels (represented in this collection by the Bluefield Inn and the Hotel Roanoke). Among the company's larger merger acquisitions was the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad--the "Nickel Plate Road"--in 1964. Other acquisitions represented in this collection are the Atlantic &amp; Danville Railway (1962); the New Jersey, Indiana &amp; Illinois Railroad (through acquisition of the Wabash Railroad, 1962); and the Winston-Salem Southbound Railway (acquired and operated jointly with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, 1909). In 1982, the N&amp;W combined with the Southern Railway to form Norfolk Southern Corporation.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This collection contains materials from the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway, several of its predecessor and subsidiary lines, and associated companies. The collection contains such items as financial and legal documents, reports, maps, plans, working documents (tickets and timetables), printed materials and photographs. 
</p>
<p>The operations of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway are represented in the collection by a diverse array of materials, including such items as two Interstate Commerce Commission accident reports, a seniority roster of conductors in the Pocahontas Branch, a 1945 description and classification of the company's passenger cars, and printed materials (including legal agreements, historical data, a list of Roanoke sidings and team tracks, and an employee's paper cap bearing the company logo). The N&amp;W materials also include several timetables from the line's Radford Division, bulletins relating to the company's military veterans association, memoranda from the Passenger Department, and a collection of unissued train tickets. Also included are a small set of photographs (reproductions) of N&amp;W locomotives; a few snapshots of locomotives, trains, and an unidentified station (probably Rural Retreat, Virginia); and a panoramic photo of a 1920 train accident at Rural Retreat, Virginia. Most significantly, perhaps, the materials include a bound set of standard plans issued by the office of the company's chief engineer. The standards book includes specifications for company-manufactured or -constructed buildings, tools, signs, roadways, bridges, tunnels, appurtenances, etc.</p>
<p>Much of the remainder of the collection consists of construction job files for New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad Company (the "Nickel Plate Road") projects in Ohio during the late 1950s. Included in the files for jobs at Huron, Canton, Toledo, Massilon, Georgetown, Fremont, Ironville, Cleveland, and Burbank, are maps, legal documents, balance sheets, correspondence, and reports.</p>
<p>The collection also contains antebellum payment records from the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad, including payrolls for masonry, "incidental graduation," and "equipments;" and vouchers for goods and services received. From the Norfolk and Western Railroad, the collection includes a large map of the depot grounds and a proposed arrangement for tracks at Central Station (Radford, Virginia?), as well as a few legal/financial papers, and several photographs (reproductions) of the company's locomotives. The collection also includes a folder of financial papers relating to construction of the New Jersey, Indiana &amp; Illinois Railroad; a set of unissued Roanoke Machine Works stock certificates; and receipts issued to the Bluefield Inn and the Hotel Roanoke, mostly for grocery purchases.</p>

<p>The Norfolk &amp; Western Railway and Associated Companies Collection was acquired as part of a larger collection of railway-related material that had been compiled by a collector, then sold to a dealer. In the course of processing, materials that could be determined to relate specifically to the Norfolk &amp; Western, its predecessors and affiliates were removed to a separate collection.
