         <p>John Newton Smith, a Confederate cavalryman, was born in
         Nansemond County, Virginia on March 5, 1843. He was the oldest
         child of Burwell Riddick and Sarah Marie Cross. On June 4,
         1861, "Newt" Smith enlisted at Suffolk in what would
         eventually become Company I of the 13th Virginia Cavalry.
         Smith died from typhoid fever at Hanover Courthouse military
         hospital (Virginia) on June 9, 1863.</p>
         <p>Charles Gulager, an artist and Union cavalryman, was born
         on August 7, 1826. Best known for his paintings of naval and
         coastal subjects, Gulager lived in Philadelphia prior to the
         Civil War, and his paintings were exhibited at the
         Pennsylvania Academy in 1860. During the Civil War, Gulager
         was a private in Company A, 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry. He died
         on December 1, 1898, and is buried in Oakwood Cemetery, Falls
         Church, Virginia.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
         <p>This collection contains Civil War materials which had been
         inherited by Edward G. and Dorothea Little Vanderslice
         Fenwick. The collection is divided into two series: the
         Charles Gulager sketchbook and the John Newton Smith
         correspondence.</p>
         <p>The Charles Gulager sketchbook (measuring approximately 5 x
         7 inches) contains more than 30 sketches drawn by Gulager
         while he served in Company A of the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry.
         Many of the sketches depict war-related scenes, such as camps,
         soldiers and ships. Also among the sketches are illustrations
         of such historic structures as Mount Vernon and the Chain
         Bridge at Washington, D. C. (Selections from the sketchbook
         were published by Mr. Fenwick in 1987 under the title The
         Civil War Sketches of Charles Gulager [call number: NC139.G85
         A4 1987 Civil War Spec]). The sketches may also be viewed by
         searching "Gulager" on Special Collections' ImageBase
         (http://imagebase.lib.vt.edu/). While many of the sketches are
         titled, some are either untitled or have titles which are
         illegible.</p>
         <p>The John Newton Smith correspondence contains letters
         written by Smith while serving with Company I, 13th Virginia
         Cavalry. The letters span the first half of 1863 and are
         written mostly from Essex County, as well as other points in
         northeastern Virginia. Smith's letters are devoted largely to
         personal matters (especially his need for a hat, the illness
         and death of his horse, war-time prices and family affairs),
         but he also writes of military matters (especially the
         Chancellorsville campaign). The correspondence concludes with
         letters from Smith's cousin, Charles Croft, regarding Smith's
         severe illness and subsequent death, as well as documents
         related to the military pay due Smith's estate. The series
         also contains a set of transcriptions made-probably in the
         early twentieth century-from the original letters.</p>

         <p>Charles Gulager Sketchbook, c.1861-1865: This series
         contains a sketchbook kept by Gulager during the Civil War.
         The sketchbook is self-contained, and the illustrations are
         arranged in no particular order.</p>
         <p>John Newton Smith Letters, 1863-1864: This series contains
         letters written by Smith from various points in northeastern
         Virginia during the first half of 1863. It also contains
         letters from Charles Croft regarding Smith's illness and
         death, as well as official communications regarding the
         military pay due Smith's estate. The letters, which are
         arranged chronologically, are followed by a set of
         transcriptions, also arranged by date of original letter.</p>
