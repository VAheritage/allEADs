            <p>Harrison Hagans, son of George and Persis Eggleston Hagans, was born Vergennes,
                Vermont, on June 17, 1796. Around 1815, the Hagans family moved to what is now
                Preston County, West Virginia, settling permanently near what is now the community
                of Brandonville in 1818. Harrison Hagans married Jane McCollum (1796-1874), and the
                couple had eight children. Hagans became proprietor of a general store and served as
                president of the Greenville Mining and Manufacturing Company in 1836/1837. Around
                1852, he built Virginia Furnace (also known as Muddy Creek Furnace and Josephine
                Furnace). He served as Brandonville's first postmaster, as a justice of the peace,
                and on several boards appointed to oversee local road construction projects. He was
                a member of the 1861 Wheeling convention, which led to the formation of the state of
                West Virginia, and of the West Virginia state legislature in 1866/1867. Harrison Hagans
                died in Preston County on May 7, 1867, and was buried in Brandonville Cemetery.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection contains business ledgers attributed to Harrison Hagans, a general
                store proprietor and iron furnace operator in Preston County, (West) Virginia during
                the 19th century. The collection includes a time book said to have been maintained
                at Hagans' Muddy Creek Furnace (also known as Virginia Furnace and Josephine
                Furnace). The ledger provides names of workers and shows the number of days worked
                by each per month. The collection also includes daybooks maintained at Hagans'
                general store. The ledgers include dates of transactions, customer names, goods
                purchased, and prices paid.</p>
            <note audience="external" label="Note">
                <p>The ledgers do not themselves identify Hagans as their owner/creator. One of the
                    daybooks bears a cover that identifies Hagans' store as the source, but the
                    cover appears to have been sewn on several decades after the transactions within
                    were recorded. A check of census records, however, seems to confirm that the
                    ledgers do originate from the time and place claimed. That the time book
                    originated from Muddy Creek Furnace is derived from information provided by the
                    seller of the collection. Secondary sources note that Harris opened the Muddy
                    Creek Furnace (also known as the Virginia Furnace) 10-12 years after the
                    creation of the ledger, but he was involved in similar concerns as early as
                    1836, and a few notations in the ledger hint that it was used by an iron
                    furnace.</p>
