      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Little biographical information is available on Donald S. Wallace. He worked as an engineer
        for the U.S. Geological Survey Water Resources Division until at least 1952, including
        several months on the Water Resources Committee and a related subcommittee. Wallace served
        as Commissioner of the Water Resources Division during his tenure, as well.</p>
      <p>In 1926, the <corpname encodinganalog="110$a">Virginia Division of Water Resources and
          Power</corpname> was established. The name changed to the <corpname encodinganalog="110$a"
          >Virginia Division of Water Resources</corpname> in 1943. Eventually, the division came
        under the control of the <corpname encodinganalog="110$a">Virginia Department of
          Conservation and Economic Development</corpname> until it ceased to exist as a single
        agency. Much of the same work is now under the jurisdiction of the <corpname
          encodinganalog="110$a">Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation</corpname> and
        the <corpname encodinganalog="110$a">Virginia Department of Environmental Quality</corpname>
        (established in 1993). Additional materials in the collection relate to the <corpname
          encodinganalog="110$a">Virginia State Water Control Board</corpname>, initially
        established in 1946 and now a part of the <corpname encodinganalog="110$a">Virginia
          Department of Conservation and Recreation</corpname>.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection contains a selection of Wallace's professional correspondence, U.S.
        Geological Survey Reports, Virginia state agency and local reports, and photographs from
        sites around the state.</p>
      <p>A majority of the correspondence, dating 1943-1945 and 1951-1952, consists of letters
        received as carbon copies. The collection contains only a few letters to or by Wallace. As
        much of the correspondence relates to the drafting of division documents, enclosures are
        attached, including annotated versions of documentation and hand-drawn maps. The photographs
        depict a number of sites. Only a portion of them are identified, specifically those taken
        around the Roanoke and Smith Rivers in Virginia.</p>
      <p>The collection contains several series of reports from 1943 to 1970, described in further
        detail below. There are published and unpublished U.S. Geological Survey reports about
        different regions in Virginia; published Virginia state agency reports; and county and local
        agency and individual reports. Most of the county and local reports were written by
        engineers or engineering firms from Virginia. </p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement id="aspace_96db6d863f7f01605d6493e2a734a698">
      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The collection is arranged in the following series: Series I: Correspondence, Series II:
        Photographs, Series III: U.S. Geological Survey Reports, Series IV: Virginia State Agency
        Reports, and Series V: Local Reports. </p>
      <p>Series I: Correspondence contains business correspondence from portions of Wallace's tenure
        with the Virginia Water Resources Division. Any enclosure are attached to the original
        correspondence. The 1943-1945 correspondence relates to trips and projects throughout
        Virginia. Much of it is copies of letters sent to individuals other than Wallace. Several of
        the letters were written by William M. McGill, the Assistant State Geologist during the
        period. Letters and memoranda from 1951-1952 are concerned with the creation of the Water
        Resources Committee and include drafts of committee documentation. The committee was
        disbanded, along with other state committees, due to lack of funding, in late 1952. Of
        particular interest is a thank you note to Wallace from Governor John S. Battle (October 15,
        1952) in appreciation for his service with the committee. </p>
      <p>Series II: Photographs contains a collection of approximately 80 items. In most cases, the
        negative image is available as well. The photographs have been left in their original order
        and the negatives placed with the matching images. Most of the photographs are not
        identified. The collection of 3¼ x 4½ photographs have handwritten captions on the back,
        identifying the sites along the Roanoke River near Buggs Island. Other select images with
        captions include such sites as the Appomattox River, the Smith River near Philpott,
        Virginia, and the Shenandoah River. Based on the few dated images and dates in the
        collection, the photographs were most likely taken in the 1940s.</p>
      <p>Series III: U.S. Geological Survey Reports contains a collection of published and
        unpublished reports relating to water in Virginia. The unpublished reports are written on
        specific rivers or flood regions in the state. Topics of published reports include water
        resource investigations, flood reports, and streamflow analysis. While all the reports in
        this series were distributed by the U.S. Geological Survey, several were written in
        conjunction with Virginia agencies or local Department of the Interior employees.</p>
      <p>Series IV: Virginia State Agency Reports contains seven published reports. Two are on
        specific regions (the James and York River Basins), and the remainder deal with aspects of
        water in Virginia (surface water and water and mineral resources). Most of the reports were
        created by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Economic Development, Division of
        Water Resources.</p>
      <p>Series V: Local Reports contains several consulting reports by independent engineers or
        engineering groups. Areas covered include Augusta, Bath, Chesterfield, and Fairfax counties,
        and the city of Alexandria. This series also contains a collection of reports entitled,
        "Results of spring trip, August 1962." Each report consists of several pages of spring
        locations and related data. The following Virginia counties have reports: Alleghany,
        Augusta, Bath, Botetourt, Craig, Frederick, Highland, Page, Rockbridge, Rockingham, and
        Shenandoah.</p>
