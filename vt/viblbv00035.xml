      <p>The Board of Visitors elected Barringer as the sixth
         president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute on 17 May 1907.
         Accomplishments of his administration included: entrance
         requirements raised from four to fourteen units; a Farmer's
         Winter Course established; summer school expanded. Barringer's
         tenure as president was not a smooth one, hampered by several
         investigations. From the start, he was determined to develop
         the agricultural facet of the College until it was at least
         equal to the engineering component, which caused some
         dissatisfaction among certain alumni and faculty. In 1909, the
         Chairman of the Alumni Association Welfare Committee, Lawrence
         Priddy, attempted to have the Board of Visitors oust
         Barringer. The Board ordered an investigation and a public
         hearing was held 25 March 1910, at which Priddy's charges were
         dismissed as "unwarranted" and "inaccurate." However, this was
         not the end of Barringer's problems. In the fall of 1911, the
         Board again called for an investigation when a former
         Commandant of Cadets accused Barringer of "countenancing
         immorality" on campus. The investigation concluded that the
         charges were "without foundation." Having survived those
         investigations, Barringer next ran afoul of Governor Mann, who
         wanted the College to become involved in agriculture extension
         work. Barringer did not agree, so Mann said he would appoint a
         Board of Visitors antagonistic to Barringer if he did not
         resign. On 10 June 1912, Barringer resigned, but the Board
         asked him to remain in office another year until a new
         president was selected.</p>
