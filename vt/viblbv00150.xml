<head>Biographical/Historical Information
</head>
<p>Hilltop Gardens Trailer Park was established and constructed by Joel Bush Spahr in 1959. Located to the northeast of Blacksburg on Virginia Route 685, the trailer park offered married students a nice place to
live during a time when few apartments existed in Blacksburg. Spahr was interested in gardening and landscaped the lots that the trailers occupied. After Joel Spahr's death in 1977, his wife Christine ran the
trailer park until her death in 1990. Their daughters, Sandra Jennings and Janet Spahr, then owned and operated the trailer park until it closed in 1999.
