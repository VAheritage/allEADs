      <p>The Montgomery White Sulphur Springs resort, located in
         Ellett Valley (near Blacksburg), Virginia, was incorporated by
         a group of local businessmen in 1855. Benefiting from the
         popular belief in the restorative powers of mineral waters,
         the Montgomery White catered to a new leisure class seeking
         healthy and entertaining distractions. In doing so, the resort
         joined such other nearby establishments as the Greenbrier
         White, Old Sweet, and Yellow Sulphur springs. The Montgomery
         White, encompassing several acres of land, boasted a
         three-story hotel with more than 200 rooms and more than 30
         cottages on the grounds.</p>
      <p>In 1862 the resort was designated a Confederate general
         hospital, charged with caring for sick and wounded soldiers.
         By the end of the summer, the hospital was at capacity, with
         more than 400 patients. While there is no complete list of
         those who died in the hospital, the nearby cemetery is said to
         hold 265 graves.</p>
      <p>Following the war and much renovation, the Montgomery White
         again opened to the public and became a popular summertime
         destination. In 1872, the resort hosted the first board
         meeting of the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College,
         and in 1874, Jefferson Davis visited for the Southern
         Historical Society's organizational meeting.</p>
      <p>By 1886, George W. Fagg &amp; Company operated the resort,
         which continued to be a successful enterprise for some years.
         By the 1890s, however, the Montgomery White and other such
         resorts were slowly declining in popularity. The economic
         panic of 1893, together with undocumented instances of fire
         and flood, may have accelerated the resort's downfall. The
         Montgomery White property was sold by auction and the
         remaining structures dismantled in 1904.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Montgomery White Sulphur Springs resort register
         includes the names of the resort's guests, their place of
         residence and notes on their meals, rooms and porterage. While
         the resort played host to guests from all areas of the United
         States--and a few from foreign countries--a number of guests
         were local residents. Each alternate register page features an
         advertisement for either the Hexall Mills or the Southern
         Fertilizing Company, both of Richmond, Virginia. The
         register's entries commence on June 30, 1886 and end on July
         26, 1890.</p>
