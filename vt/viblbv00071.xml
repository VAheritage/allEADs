      <p>Mary Draper Ingles, trans-Alleghany pioneer, was born in
         Philadelphia in 1732, the daughter of George and Elenor Hardin
         Draper. In 1748, she moved with her parents to Southwest
         Virginia, where Mary married William Ingles (born in London,
         1729) in 1750. The Draper and Ingles families together
         established the first English-speaking settlement west of the
         Alleghanies at Draper's Meadow (predecessor to today's
         Blacksburg).</p>
      <p>In July 1755, Mary Draper Ingles, her sons George and
         Thomas, her sister-in-law Betty Draper and others were
         captured during a Shawnee raid and were led up the New River
         and into present-day Kentucky. Eventually, Mary escaped, and
         her 850-mile trek back to her home has been documented in a
         number of published sources and a dramatic interpretation.</p>
      <p>After her return, Mary and her husband William lived in
         Bedford County for several years but eventually returned to
         Montgomery County. At a location within the bounds of
         present-day Radford, Virginia, they established Ingles Ferry,
         which eventually grew to include a tavern, general store and
         blacksmith shop. Mary would give birth to four more children
         (John, Mary, Susan and Rhoda) before her husband died in 1782.
         Mary died in 1815.</p>
