</head>
      <p>Spencer C. Stanhope was born around 1825. For many years prior to the Civil War, he lived in the South. He enlisted in Company H of the 31st New York Infantry on May 21, 1861. Enlisting in New York City as a first sergeant, Stanhope was promoted to first lieutenant on August 2. He resigned on January 2, 1862.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a letter from former Union Army officer Spencer C. Stanhope to C. P. Leverich (likely Charles P. Leverich of Leverich &amp; Company). Writing from New York, Stanhope describes his desperate circumstances and pleads for financial assistance. He notes that his grandfather, R. N. Waite, had been a banker that associated with the Leverich family. He continues by admitting that the public has become suspicious of veterans requesting assistance. "It seems to be the recognized custom," he writes, "to regard every crippled soldier who applies for work, or assistance, as an imposter..." In a second letter, which had likely been enclosed with the first, Stanhope states that he is "sick, crippled and out of employment." He writes of having disposed of all of his possessions and spending the past three nights on the streets and claims that without help he will soon die.  Despite his crippled condition, he writes, he will accept any type of employment.
