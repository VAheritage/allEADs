      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Charles Doe was born in Derry, New Hampshire, in April 1830. After graduating from
                Dartmouth College, he went on to practice law in Dover, New Hampshire. He served as
                Solicitor for Strafford County, and later as an assistant clerk to the New Hampshire
                State Senate (1853-1854). In 1859, he was appointed as a justice to the New
                Hampshire Supreme Judicial Court. The court was dissolved briefly during 1874 and
                1875, but upon the creation of the State Supreme Court in 1876, Doe was reappointed,
                this time as Chief Justice. He remained Chief Justice until his death in
                Rollinsford, New Hampshire, in 1896.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a">
      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection consists of two letters written by Doe to his family in Maine in 1850.
                Both were penned in Danville, Virginia, when Doe was traveling to the South. Each
                letter is around three pages in length.</p>
      <p>The first is an eyewitness account of how the US Congress goes about their debates.
                References Congressmen Toombs, Webster, Clay, and Cass. It includes the quote "I
                imagine it will take some time for me to get used to these negroes. I would not mind
                a few, but everybody must have so many around them, that it requires some tact to
                more without stepping on them. I don't like to see them work. They move as if they
                had rheumatism in every joint."</p>
      <p>The second is a description of church culture in Danville. It mentions churches of the
                following denominations: Baptist, Methodist, Episcopal, and Presbyterian, describing
                the physical arrangement of the church as women in front, men on the sides, and
                negroes in the gallery. Doe also relays that morning preaching is generally for whites
                and afternoon for blacks. He mentions there is a lack of free schooling and describes
                most people as ignorant and claims Virginia is "as far behind as any state" he has
                seen. </p>
