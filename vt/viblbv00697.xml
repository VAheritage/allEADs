            <head>Historical Information</head>
            <p>The Keystone View Company was a major distributor of stereographic images, and was
                located in Meadville, Pennsylvania. From 1892 through 1963 Keystone produced and
                distributed both educational and comic/sentimental stereoviews and stereoscopes. The
                Company primarily marketed themselves to schools in the early twentieth century. As
                of 1905 the Company was the world's largest stereographic company.</p>
            <p>Dozens of staff photographers were employed in the early 1900s. Also in the early
                1900s, when stereoviewing was declining and other companies were in trouble,
                Keystone bought their stocks and incorporated them into their own holdings. Notable
                amongst many such purchases were the huge and varied inventories of B. W. Kilburn,
                the H. C. White Company, and Underwood &amp; Underwood. As a result, Keystone
                claimed to have had some 2 million negatives by the mid-1930s. </p>
            <p>By the 1920s the Keystone Company was the sole surviving major producer of
                conventional card-mounted views anywhere in the world. They had offices in London,
                Paris, Sidney, Capetown, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo. Part of this prominence was
                derived from the sale of World War I stereograph sets, as Keystone was one of the
                only publishers to secure permission to photograph battlefields and military
                operations.</p>

            <p>The collection consists predominantly of correspondence by between salesmen in the
                field and the management of the Keystone View Company from 1903-1908. <emph

                collection also contains a single folder of blank order forms (referenced in some of
                the correspondence), purchase receipts, and two of Barnhart's draft cards
