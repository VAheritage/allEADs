      <p>John McJellison was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in Company K, 27th Regiment,
                Maine Infantry, on September 17, 1862. He mustered out with the regiment in June
                1863. </p>
      <p>The 27th Maine was notable for soldiers voluntarily staying beyond their original
                enlistment period in 1863 to guard Washington D.C. against Lee's offensive into
                Pennsylvania. However, these volunteers only remained in defense of the capitol for
                four days and returned to Maine in time to muster out with the rest of the regiment.
                Still, Congress awarded the entire regiment of more than 850 men the Medal of Honor.
                The awards were purged by Congress in 1917 as the "actions of the regiment did not
                meet the criteria for receiving such a medal." Although the medals were not taken
                away, the names of the recipients were stricken from the roll. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection contains two items. McJellison's commission papers are signed by the
                Secretary of State for Maine, Joseph B. Hall, and the Maine Adjutant General, John
                L. Hodsdon. The other item is a letter from McJellison's nephew, Horatio E. Goodwin,
                a private in the 2nd Regiment, Massachusetts Infantry. Stationed in Maryland,
                Goodwin writes of war news he has heard, and picket and camp duties.</p>
