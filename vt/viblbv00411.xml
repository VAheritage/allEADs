<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>Letter is written to <title render="doublequote">Cousin Louise</title> by Robert J. Wells on November 30, 1864.  Wells writes about fighting a <title render="doublequote">Negro</title> regiment on the 28th of November and being shelled by <title render="doublequote">yanks.</title>  Wells also complains of his <title render="doublequote">Sweetheart</title> who has <title render="doublequote">been punishing me too greatly,</title> saying she does not write to him often enough.  This is too much to deal with among the other privations of camp life.  Wells also mentions attempts to secure the effects of Cousin Louise's brother who was killed in battle. Wells discusses some expectation of getting his knapsack and sending it from Richmond.  Wells closes the letter asking Cousin Lou to tell his <title render="doublequote">Sweet</title> that he has <title render="doublequote">always carried her with me.</title>  Wells mentions receiving a letter from Cousin Charley and gives his regards to Cousin Shug.
