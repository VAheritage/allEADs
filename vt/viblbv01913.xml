      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>John Henning Woods, a Southern Unionist, Confederate conscript, and Civil War memoirist,
        was born in Tennessee on July 4, 1834. After spending his childhood in Missouri, Woods
        married Mary Emma Caldwell, the daughter of a wealthy slaveholder and planter from Alabama
        in 1860. In 1861, Woods moved to Lebanon, Tennessee, to pursue his law degree at Cumberland
        University. Despite his ties to the South, Woods hated slavery and strongly supported the
        Union. Following the war's beginning and interruption of his education, he returned home to
        farm and teach. </p>
      <p>Due to his support for the Union, Woods chose to remain at home throughout the beginning of
        the war until his conscription into the Confederate army in October of 1862. While at first
        Woods fought to remain at home, the threat of imprisonment eventually sparked him to report
        to the army, where he was drafted into the 36th Alabama Infantry Regiment, Company K. As a
        part of this regiment, Woods was trained at Talladega and then posted around Mobile,
        Alabama. </p>
      <p>While at Mobile, Woods and a few fellow Unionist conscripts formed a secret Unionist
        organization called the Home Circle and planned a mutiny. Unfortunately, Woods was
        discovered prior to their planned mutiny and imprisoned to be tried. While awaiting his
        court martial, Woods was transported behind the army, following them through the Tullahoma
        Campaign and was then sent to Atlanta. His trial resulted in a sentence of death by firing
        squad; however, his execution was delayed due to the interference of a sympathetic general
        who had been his professor before the war. Woods saw the Battles of Chickamauga and
        Chattanooga while imprisoned by the Confederate Army until he was once again sent to Atlanta
        following a stay of execution, furnished at the last minute from Jefferson Davis. He was
        then sent to work building trenches around Atlanta until he finally escaped Confederate
        officials on August 11, 1864, and made his way into Union lines. </p>
      <p>Following his escape, Woods made his way to Buffalo, New York, where he enlisted in the
        93rd New York Infantry Regiment. He served out the rest of the war as a clerk for the Union
        Army until his discharge on May 11, 1865. Following the war, Woods returned home and
        continued to teach, moving to Lawrence County, Missouri sometime before 1885. In 1885, his
        wife Mary died and in 1889, he married Mae Laverall of Pennsylvania. Woods died on March 5,
        1901, and is buried alongside both of his wives and his daughter in the Woodland Cemetery
        near Springfield, Missouri. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection includes three memoir volumes and three diaries written by John Henning
        Woods, a Southern Unionist, Confederate conscript, and eventual Union soldier during the
        American Civil War. While the collection spans the period of years from 1856 through 1873,
        the majority of the collection focuses on the years during the Civil War. </p>
      <p>The three volumes of Woods' memoir make up the largest portion of the collection. These
        three books focus on the years 1861-1864, describing his experiences of sectionalism, his
        opposition to secession and conscription, the process of forming an underground Unionist
        society in a Confederate regiment, his arrest for inciting a mutiny, and the resulting
        imprisonment and trial.</p>
      <p>The three journals cover a much broader range of topics and years, including genealogy,
        religion, marriage, slavery, and Woods' childhood. These three journals serve to
        contextualize the journals, as Woods referenced them during the writing process. Besides
        this, these journals also contain highly detailed drawings done by Woods during his
        imprisonment and a number of short entries in Pitman shorthand. </p>
