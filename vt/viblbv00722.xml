            <p>The Alabama Great Southern Railroad was established in 1877, through the
                reorganization of the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad. Controlling interest in the
                company was sold in 1890 to the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railway and the
                Richmond and Danville Railroad, and the line eventually became part of the Southern
                Railway system.</p>
