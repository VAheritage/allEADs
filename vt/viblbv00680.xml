      <head>Biographical Information </head>
      <p>George Washington Morgan was born in Washington County, Pennsylvania, in 1820. At the
                age of sixteen, Morgan left Washington College where he was studying to enlist for
                Houston in the War for Texan Independence. He entered as a lieutenant and was
                quickly appointed to captain. After his service, Morgan enrolled in the United
                States Military Academy. He stayed only two years, however, and began studying law
                under his future partner, J. K. Miller, in Mount Vernon, Ohio. Morgan was admitted
                to the bar and became the prosecutor for Knox County. Morgan held his position until
                he resigned to enlist as colonel of the 2nd Ohio Volunteers in the U.S.-Mexico War.
                At only twenty-seven years old, Morgan was commissioned Colonel of the 15th United
                States Infantry. Morgan was wounded at the battles of Contreras and Churubusco, and
                was named brigadier-general for his "gallant and meritorious conduct." </p>
      <p>In 1848, Morgan returned to civilian life in Mount Vernon, Ohio, where he farmed and
                practiced law. President Pierce appointed him consul at Marseilles in 1856, and he
                became minister to Lisbon two years later. Morgan resigned this post to take up arms
                for the Union in the Civil War. He was appointed brigadier-general and given command
                of the 7th Division of Buell's Army of the Ohio, then a division in the Vicksburg
                campaign, and finally the XIII Corps. After battling illness and discontent with the
                policy of using African American troops, Morgan resigned from the service in 1863. </p>
      <p>Morgan was elected to Congress in 1866, serving until he was unseated in 1868. He was
                elected the following year, and served until 1873. After leaving Congress, Morgan
                returned to his law practice in Mount Vernon. Morgan was married to Sarah H. Hall
                and fathered two daughters. He died in Fortress Monroe, Virginia, in 1893.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>The collection contains the signature of George Washington Morgan. Morgan signed his
                name, "G. W. Morgan", on a list of subscribers' names and requested 2000 copies of
                an item. Included in this collection is a brief biography of Morgan. Signatures of
                three other people are included in the collection. One signature appears to belong
                to Abram O. Miller, but the other two are unidentified. </p>
