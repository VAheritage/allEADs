            <head>Biographical Information</head>
            <p>Martin Urner was born in Rockingham County, Virginia, in 1813. In March 1837, he
                married his first wife, Barbara Zirkle (1818-1845). Before her death, they had four
                children: Sarah C. (1838-1864), John Osborn (1840-1914), Lewis Harvey (1842-1925),
                and Emily Susan (b.1845). In 1848, he married Susan Keyser (b.1824) and together
                they had five children: Annie Floren (1851-1862), Charles Keyser (b.1854), Clarence
                Henry (b.1856), Frances Mary (1858-1862), and Margaret C. (b.1863).</p>
            <p>Urner was a saddler in New Market, Shenandoah County, Virginia. He was also a
                minister and served as pastor of the Smith Creek Baptist Church in New Market from
                1868 until his death. (His second wife was the daughter of a previous minister at
                the church.) Urner died in New Market in 1888. Susan Urner lived until at least
                1910. </p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>Ledger is organized by customer name and date. Each page usually contains either one
                or two customers, while each line represents an individual day's transactions. Some
                item descriptions are detailed, but most are simple, e.g. "1 Wagon whip" or "For
                repairs to a side saddle." </p>
            <p>Details are also recorded for payments. Urner accepted many methods of payment,
                including cash, services, and barter for his services. Examples of payment include
                bushels of potatoes received over the course of a year, the use of a horse and plow
                hand for four days, and "dentistry."</p>
