      <abstract label="Abstract">After graduating from Randolph-Macon Woman's College in 1929, Channel earned her degree in architecture at Cornell University in 1933. She returned to her hometown of Portsmouth, Virginia, and worked at a firm for two years before opening her own office as the first registered woman architect in Virginia. She became known for her residential and church designs. Her collection includes sketches and drawings for about 160 mostly residential projects in the Portsmouth area. Also included are some college drawings and projects.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>Mary Ramsay Brown Channel was born December 8, 1907 to William Ambrose Brown and Mary Ramsay Brown of Portsmouth, VA.</p>
      <p>She attended Randolph-Macon’s Woman's College earning a bachelor of Mathematics in 1929.  Channel wanted to follow her brother to the University of Virginia to study architecture, but women were not accepted into the University's graduate programs at the time.  She instead applied and was accepted to Cornell University School of Architecture.</p>
      <p>Graduating second in her class in 1933, she was also the first woman to win the Baird Prize Competition Medal.  The Baird Prize was a six day design competition held by Cornell for architecture students in their junior and senior years.  Channel was awarded the second prize medal for her design of a “monumental aeration fountain for the city reservoir.” </p>
      <p> Channel returned to Portsmouth, VA after graduation and began her career with the Norfolk architecture firm Rudolph, Cooke and Van Leeuwen.  She drew no salary for her two years but gained valuable experience working with the team that designed the main post office in Norfolk as well as several other civic and organizational buildings. In 1935, Channel was one of three candidates in a class of five to pass the Virginia Examining Board’s licensing exam becoming Virginia’s first licensed female architect. </p>
      <p>Following her licensure she opened her own practice.  In October, 1941 she married local businessman Warren Henry Channel.  After the birth of her first child she limited her practice to residences and churches.  Channel retained her license until 1990 and was actively drawing plans into her eighties.</p>
      <p>Channel designed structures throughout southeastern Virginia.  Some of her projects include the Lafayette Square Arch housing the main entrance of the demolished American National Bank, the old Virginia Power Company Building on High Street, Channel Furniture Store in Greenbrier, numerous houses, church additions, and renovations.</p>
      <p>She was recognized in October, 1987, at an occasion honoring Portsmouth’s local and statewide notables.</p>
      <p>Mary Ramsay Brown Channel died on January 21, 2006.  She was 98 years old.

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection contains sketches and drawings for approximately 160 Portsmouth area projects, the majority of the drawings represent residential designs but churches, retail stores, and institutional buildings are also included.  Watercolor class projects from her days at Cornell University School of Architecture are also present; however, these drawings are extremely fragile and may require conservation work prior to access.  The materials range in date from 1936-1978 with the bulk of the materials ranging from 1936-1950.  </p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement encodinganalog="351">
      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>Mary Ramsay Brown Channel did not consistently label or date her drawings. The records are arranged in a project index alphabetically by client’s name. When a client’s name was not available the records were ordered by project description and/or title.  Any text in brackets was supplied by the processor.              
            </p>
      <p>In order to determine a date range for each project Channel’s signature has been recorded in the project index.  MRB stands for Mary Ramsay Brown and would indicate projects undertaken before her marriage in 1941.  MBC stands for Mary Brown Channel and would indicate dates post-1941.  </p>
      <p>On the reverse of a majority of projects there is a number in red ink.  This number appears to be an organizational scheme and therefore has been recorded on the project index.  They were very helpful in bringing together drawings that had become separated from their projects.  However, the researcher should note, there are several cases where the same number appears on distinctly different projects. </p>
