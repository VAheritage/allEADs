      <p>Chapman Johnston French was born on August 15, 1880 and died in Troutdale, Virginia
                on July 6, 1964. His parents were Charles D. (born January 8, 1850) and Annie C.
                Johnston French (born November 24, 1853 and died in August, 1934).In 1902, he
                graduated from Virginia Tech and became a civil engineer for Norfolk &amp; Western
                Railway. He was a dedicated worker, who often spent the weekends in the office and
                traveled extensively around Virginia and West Virginia for his job. During this
                time, he lived in Narrows, Virginia with his first wife, Lela Lee Weatherly French.
                Later, Chapman and his wife moved to Roanoke. After Lela's death, which occurred
                sometime prior to 1930, Chapman married Mildred Greer and retired in 1950.</p>
      <p>Chapman was a member of several organizations, including the American Society of
                Civil Engineers, Elks, the Knights of Pythias, the Groundhog Club, the National
                Geographic Society, the Dramatic Order of Knights of Knorassan, the Blue Ridge Game
                and Fish Association, and the VPI Alumni Association. As a young man, his main
                interests were dancing, ice-skating, photography, hunting, and listening to baseball
                on the radio; as he grew older, he became an avid gardener and bridge player.
                Chapman was close to his parents throughout his life: he often drove them to church.
                Additionally, he was a frequent visitor of his sister's family and an animal lover
                who owned various cats and dogs. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>This collection consists of twenty-three diaries written by Chapman J. French during
                the years of 1906-1912, 1928-1935, and 1937-1944. Each diary meticulously details
                Chapman's day-to-day life, including the weather, work projects, social outings,
                leisure activities, and travel information. In the back of each diary, there are
                cost accounts; addresses; major league baseball scores; births, deaths, and
                marriages lists; Christmas shopping lists; work notes and equations; and recipes,
                mostly of the alcoholic drink variety. Most diaries commence with a reward offer if
                the diary is lost, ranging from 50 cents to a dollar. </p>
      <p>Some notable diary entries include lyrics to, "Starkle Starkle Little Twink" by
                Charlie Drake in a 1944 diary and a political advertisement depicting an elephant
                farting with the words, "Prosperity is in the air The G.O.P. Brand" in a 1932
                diary. Although Chapman's journal entries usually relate just the facts of the day,
                he pens a strong opinion about golf in the back of a 1928 diary: "A useless game
                that needlessly prolongs the worthless lives of unnecessary citizens." In a 1911
                diary, various word puzzles are scattered throughout the entries. In a January 4
                entry of the same diary, Chapman writes, "Eat, drink, be merry, seize the present
                hour, know not the future holds a fairer flower. What is remembered dies, what is
                written lives. (Guess this won't die)." </p>
