<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Carter J. Glass Civil War Collection consists of a letter written by Glass to his sister, Martha.  The letter was written on May 3, 1864 from Point Lookout while Glass was imprisoned there. The letter discusses prisoners that are leaving due to sickness.  Glass also inquires about the welfare of prisoners that have already left the camp and he laments that he will not be able to leave as well because he can never <title render="doublequote">get sick at the right time.</title>  There is a note from December 1862 taped to the back of the letter granting Glass permission to visit Danville, VA. The collection also includes a portrait of Glass in his later years.
