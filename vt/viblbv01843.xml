      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Cora Bolton was born to James (1812-1869) and Anna Maria Harrison (1813-1873) Bolton in
        Richmond, Virginia, on August 4, 1839. She was the eldest of six children. Her father was a
        physician who worked in the Richmond area, includnig during the Civil War. In 1860, Cora,
        then 19, was living with her family there. </p>
      <p>Cora married John McLaren McBryde on November 18, 1863. They had eight children, six of
        whom lived to adulthood: Janet (1864-1869), James (1866-1925), Anna (later Anna Davidson)
        (1868-1948) John (1870-?), Charles (1872-1962), Susan (1874-1951), Meade (1877-1959), and
        Waid (abt. 1878-?). The 1880 census places the McBryde family in Knoxville, Tennessee, where
        John McBryde was teaching at the time. </p>
      <p>By 1891, they had settled in Blacksburg, where Cora would spend the remaining 29 years of
        her life. Cora died in Blacksburg, Virginia, in 1920 at the age of 80. She is buried in
        Westview Cemetery.</p>

          <p>This manuscript cookbooks (which also includes some recipes clipped from newspapers)
            belong to Cora Bolton McBryde. It's unclear when she began keeping it, but like many
            handwritten recipe books, it was added to over time (suggested by the changing writing
            tools) and may include additions from several generations (suggested by the various
            handwritings). The cookbook contains a wide variety of recipes, as well as planned (or
            intended) menus and some children's scrawls and scribbles. The majority of the recipes
            are for sweet dishes, including "Cora's Date Pudding," sponge and coffee cakes,
            puddings, snows, and icings. In addition, there are handwritten and clipped recipes for
            meat and fish dishes, vegetables, salad dressings, and breads. At least 3 recipes are
            attributed to "Flora," who could have been Cora's daughter-in-law, Flora Webster McBryde
            (wife of John, Jr.).</p>
