      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Henry Clay Trumbull, who served as chaplain in the 10th Connecticut Infantry during the
        Civil War, was born in Stonington, Connecticut on June 8, 1830. He was the son of Gurdon and
        Sarah Swan Trumbull. In 1851, Trumbull was hired as a clerk for the Hartford, Providence and
        Fishkill Railroad. The following year, while still working for the railroad, he joined the
        Congregationalist church and became superintendent of a mission Sunday school. In 1858, he
        became Connecticut state Sunday school missionary. Trumbull married Alice Cogswell Gallaudet
        in 1854. The couple would have eight children.</p>
      <p>Shortly after being ordained a Congregationalist minister in 1862, Trumbull became chaplain
        of the 10th Connecticut Infantry. Captured at the battle of Fort Wagner (South Carolina) on
        July 19, 1863, he was held prisoner until being exchanged, and on November 24, he rejoined
        the regiment. He continued to serve with the 10th until it mustered out in August, 1865.</p>
      <p>Returning to civilian service, Trumbull became New England secretary of the American
        Sunday-school Union. In 1875 he became editor of the <emph render="italic">Sunday School
          Times</emph> in Philadelphia. He continued to serve as the publication's editor until his
        death. In addition to his work with the <emph render="italic">Sunday School Times</emph>,
        Trumbull wrote more than 30 books, including <emph render="italic">War Memories of an Army
          Chaplain</emph>. He continues to be considered a pioneer of the Sunday school movement and
        in personal evangelism. Henry Clay Trumbull died on December 8, 1903.</p>
      <p>The 10th Connecticut Infantry was organized at Hartford, Connecticut and mustered into
        service on October 262, 1861. The regiment joined Burnside's coastal North Carolina campaign
        the following February, particpating in the battles of Roanoke Island and Newbern. After the
        Union victory at Newbern in March, the 10th remained in the city through the summer. The
        regiment was assigned to support McClellan's attack on Richmond in December, 1862, then was
        ordered to South Carolina. In July, 1863, the 10th participated in the assault on Fort
        Wagner before being ordered that autumn to St. Augustine, Florida for rest and recuperation. </p>
      <p>In February, 1864, veterans of the regiment returned to Hartford, Connecticut on furloughs,
        but by May, the regiment was assigned to the Army of the Jjames, moving against Confederate
        forces at City Point and Bermuda Hundred, Virginia. The regiment continued to serve in
        eastern Virginia for the remainder of the war, suffering particularly high casualties during
        the Battle for Fort Gregg in April, 1865, and participating in the final pursuit of
        Confederate forces to Appomattox Court House. The 10th Connecticut Infantry was mustered out
        of service on August 25, 1865.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection contains photocopies of the Civil War letters and journals of Henry Clay
        Trumbull, who served as chaplain in the 10th Connecticut Infantry during the Civil War. </p>
      <p>The first letter in the collection, written by Trumbull from Charleston, South Carolina on
        July 20, 1863, is addressed to an unnamed provost marshal and is in protest of being held a
        prisoner-of-war. Nearly all of the letters that follow are addressed to Trumbull's wife
        Alice. They commence with letters written from Columbia, South Carolina, with the first few
        letters describing Trumbull's capture and imprisonment. </p>
      <p>Following his arrival in St. Augustine, Florida, to rejoin the regiment during its rest and
        recuperation there, Trumbull's letters focus on his activities as regimental chaplain, his
        acquaintances in camp, the activities of the regiment itself, his environs, and family
        matters at home. Beginning in April, 1864, Trumbull's letters follow the regiment's
        movements through eastern Virginia, and are written from Fort Monroe, Gloucester Point,
        Bermuda Hundred, North Bend, and Deep Bottom, at times finding himself on the field of
        battle and under fire. (As an illustration of his duties as chaplain, on August 10, 1864,
        Trumbull relates at length the capture and execution of Private Frank McElheney, a deserter
        from the 24th Massachusetts, whom Trumbull had offered counsel.) His later letters continue
        to follow the regiment's activities, being written from camps outside Petersburg and
        Richmond. The letters end on September 1, 1865, with Trumbull writing of his arrival in
        Hartford.</p>
      <p>Trumbull's two journals cover much of the same subject matter as his letters home but in
        much greater detail. The journals commence with July 27, 1863 and continue through the end
        of 1864. Following the end of the second journal are various notations, including names and
        addresses, account expenditures, newspaper subscriptions, and the bookkeeping notes on the
        estate of Henry W. Camp.</p>
