      <abstract id="aspace_a2c557dbed680fa65195ca0d39786ac4">The collection contains correspondence
        to William Avery Stratton from friends and family. Letters date from as early as the Civil
        War (1864) to the year after Stratton's death (1940). For the most part, letters are about
        social and family news, though some of the early letters contain Civil War and post-bellum
        news from the South. Letters from friends in Oregon, Colorado, and Nevada also provide
        details on Indian affairs, railroad growth, and cattle in the West. The collection also
        contains a large number of wedding and graduation invitations for events in Oxford, New
        York, where Stratton spent much of his life.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>George Stratton (1823-1910) married Mariette Robinson (abt. 1824-1865) in January 1845.
        They had six children, all born in Oxford, New York: William Avery (1845-1939), Edward L.
        (b. December 1847), Harvey J. (b. January 1850), Luke A. (1853-1862), Tracy Frink (b. June
        1858), and Alice Robinson (b. February 1864). Some time between 1866 and 1870, George
        married his first wife's cousin, Maria A. Robinson. George and his four sons who survived to
        adulthood were all involved in dairy farming and lumber work at one time or another.
        Stratton seems to have worked in both business, probably in an office capacity, after
        mid-1881.</p>
      <p>Although some details of Stratton's life are unknown, a great deal can be found in the
        letters. He spent much of his life in parts of Chenango County, New York. He never married.
        He went to the Oxford Academy, which continues to serve (in an expanded form), as the
        central school district for Oxford. Around 1866, he attended business college in
        Poughkeepsie, New York. </p>
      <p>In 1870 and early 1871, Stratton seems to have been looking for work. After a brief trip to
        visit family and friends in Mississippi and Georgia in the spring of 1871, he settled in
        Washington, DC, having taken a clerk position with the Office of Internal Revenue, Treasury
        Department. In 1877, he left the Treasury Department and traveled in California and Oregon.
        Letters from his trip, as well as after, suggest he may be been looking to find work there.
        He was back in Oxford the next year, however. By the spring of 1879, Stratton was working
        for Lord and Taylor in New York City. In 1881, he moved to Othello, Mississippi. Some time
        after May 1881, he returned again to Chenango County. It is unclear if he remained with the
        family business(es) or found other work. He died in 1939. His sister, Alice, was his only
        sibling still alive at that time. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>A significant portion of the family correspondence shares news from places around the
        country. There is also an emphasis on family business (the selling of butter from the farm,
        land, and stock dividends, for example) and local politics. Stratton's extended family lived
        throughout central and eastern New York, as well as in other parts of the country, and
        appear often throughout the correspondence both as writers and topics. In addition to
          <famname normal="Stratton family">Stratton</famname>s, other connected families include
        the <famname normal="Chase family">Chase</famname>s, the <famname normal="Robinson family"
          >Robinson</famname>s, the <famname normal="Ten Brock family">Ten Brock</famname>s
          (<famname normal="Ten Brock family">Ten Broeck</famname>s) and the <famname
          normal="Juliand family">Juliand</famname>s. A list of major correspondents by decade is
        provided at the start of the "Content List" below.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Note:</emph> There is very little correspondence for the period of June
        1882 through November 1890, and none for the period of 1920 to 1934. </p>
      <p>In addition to letters, the collection also contains a series of wedding and graduation
        invitations. During the second half of his life, while living predominantly in Oxford, New
        York, Stratton appears to have been a popular invitee. Many of the graduation invitations
        are for his old school, the Oxford Academy. Other materials include miscellaneous
        photographs and business papers.</p>

      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The collection is arranged in three series–Series I: Correspondence, 1864-1940, Series II:
        Invitations, 1874-1935, and Series III: Ephemera. </p>
      <p>Series I: Correspondence, 1864-1940, contains more than 75 years of personal and business
        letters written to, and in a few cases, by, Stratton. A majority of the letters are from
        immediate and extended family. The remainder are from friends and business associates. In
        addition to his own jobs over the years, Stratton appears to have facilitated business
        transactions for his family's dairy.</p>
      <p>Hattie Chase (Stratton's cousin), wrote Stratton a number of letters from Georgia
        concerning treatment and perceptions of African-Americans in the south after the Civil War.
        Her letters continue into the early 1870s. After 1871, Stratton's brother, Edward, also
        writes about African-Americans, when he moved to Bolton, Mississippi, for a job with
        Robinson &amp; Withers, later Robinson &amp; Williams, then C. L. Robinson &amp; Co. Charles
        L. Robinson was probably a relation through William and Edward's mother and step-mother.</p>
      <p>Starting in 1878, Stratton received letters from a cousin, Eli Ten Brock, and a number of
        other friends living out west. These letters contain discussion of troubles with Indians,
        the growth of the railroad, and cattle driving in Oregon, Colorado, Nevada, and Texas. These
        were not the only colorful characters with whom he corresponded. After an unknown attack of
        some kind while living in Mississippi, a friend advised him that "if I had been in your
        place I would have shot a hole in him big enough to see what he had for last meal." His
        friend then recommends he buy a pistol and "shoot the H--l out of the first man that
        attempts to molest [him]." Later letters from his sister and brother-in-law, Alice and Ira
        MacFarland, relate stories of gold mining and ranching in Nevada.</p>
      <p>This series is arranged chronologically.</p>
      <p>Series II: Invitations, 1874-1935, includes invitations to events in and around Oxford, New
        York, and other locations. It contains two subseries: Subseries I: Weddings and
        Anniversaries, 1874-1935, and Subseries II: Graduations and Reunions, 1890-1900. Subseries I
        includes weddings and anniversary party invitations and announcements. Many of these have
        place cards attached. Subseries II contains invitations to graduation and reunion events at
        the Oxford Academy, some of which have attached calling cards.</p>
      <p>This series is arranged chronologically within each subseries. </p>
