      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Fay M. Thomas Letters to Edward L. Stone consists of two letters from Thomas, manager
        of the Hotel Patrick Henry in Roanoke, Virginia, to Stone, the president of Stone Printing
        and Manufacturing Co. The August 27, 1931, letter thanks Stone for sending a publication to
        Thomas, who notes that he has lent it to someone else (Mr. and Mrs. Mayer), but intends it
        to be returned for his own collection. The August 31, 1931, letter indicates that the Mayers
        would like a copy of the publication referenced in the last note and that Thomas would be
        happy to discuss upcoming travel plans of a Miss Belle da Caste Green.</p>
