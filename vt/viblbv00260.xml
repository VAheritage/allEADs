<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Stanford E. Chaill&#x00E9; was born on July 9, 1830, in Natchez, Mississippi, the descendant of several patriots of the Revolutionary War.  Educated by private tutors until his mother's death, Chaill&#x00E9; eventually graduated from Phillips' Academy in South Andover, Massachusetts, in 1847.  Chaill&#x00E9; then received an A. B. (bachelor's degree) in 1851 from Harvard College and later earned his medical degree from the Medical Department of the University of Louisiana (now Tulane) in 1853.  Chaill&#x00E9; later returned to Harvard College and received an A. M. (master's degree) in 1854.  On February 23, 1857, Dr. Chaill&#x00E9; married Laura E. Montfort.  The union produced one child, Mary Laura Chaill&#x00E9;.  Laura E. Montfort died on August 18, 1858.  Before the Civil War, Dr. Chaill&#x00E9; worked as a resident student in the New Orleans Charity Hospital and then served as a resident physician at the United States Marine Hospital and at the Circus Street Infirmary.  
</p>
<p>During the war, Dr. Chaill&#x00E9; rose from being a private in the New Orleans Light Horse Brigade to acting Confederate Surgeon General of Louisiana in 1862.  In May, 1862, Dr. Chaill&#x00E9; became the surgeon and medical inspector of the Confederate Army of Tennessee.  In July of 1863, Dr. Chaill&#x00E9; took the post of surgeon-in-charge of the Fairground Hospital #2 in Atlanta, Georgia, then transferred to Okmulgee Hospital in Macon, Georgia in December, 1863.  While in Georgia, Dr. Chaill&#x00E9; met, and later married, Mary Louisa Napier.
</p>
<p>After the Civil War, Dr. Chaill&#x00E9; lectured and demonstrated anatomy and obstetrics in New Orleans.  In 1878, Congress selected Dr. Chaill&#x00E9; to study the great yellow fever epidemic, and he later sat on the Havana Yellow Fever Commission.   Dr. Chaill&#x00E9; also contributed significantly to medical literature.  Among these contributions was his formulation of infant developmental standards in 1887.  From 1885 until his retirement in 1908, Dr. Chaill&#x00E9; served as the dean of Tulane's medical school.  Dr. Stanford E. Chaill&#x00E9; died in 1911.

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The Stanford E. Chaill&#x00E9; Collection consists of letters, government-issued documents, printed material, and two photo albums containing thirty-six photos.  Those pictured in photos include:  Dr. Chaill&#x00E9;, Laura Chaill&#x00E9;, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Layton M. D. P., and other friends.  Materials date from shortly before the American Civil War to the decades following southern Reconstruction. Salient topics are the occupation of New Orleans by the Union during the Civil War, postwar government elections, the great yellow fever epidemic, and Dr. Chaill&#x00E9;'s long career and accolades.  Several documents relate to Dr. Chaill&#x00E9;'s position as dean of the Tulane Medical School, such as a notable graduation speech welcoming Confederate leader Jefferson Davis.  Dr. Chaill&#x00E9;'s interest in genealogical research also appears in letters and documents.  In one genealogical sketch, Dr. Chaill&#x00E9; traces his family tree to France where it was "very Catholic" before 1540.
