        <p>The Charles Woodson Manuscript Collection was purchased
            from Carmen Valentino Rare Books and Manuscripts,
            Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in April 2002. A handwritten
            note in the orderly book dated July 16, 1943 indicates that
            it was found in a trunk inside "Prospect," an old Woodson
            family home in Prince Edward County, Virginia, ca. 1939.
            The names Nannie W. Venable and Nathaniel B. Venable are
            inscribed in the front of the book.</p>

      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Charles Woodson (1781-1838) was born and reared in Prince
         Edward County. He was s commissioned a captain in the Virginia
         Militia, Prince Edward County in 1803 and a colonel in 1818.
         His battalion was called into service in August 1814 and
         traveled to Tappahannock, then camped at a place he refers to
         as Camp Carters, near Richmond, probably from 30 August 1814
         to 28 December 1814.</p>
      <p>Woodson served in the Virginia House of Delegates in
         1811-1812 and was a member of the Prince Edward County
         Republican Committee of Correspondence in 1816 and the Jackson
         Committee of Correspondence and Vigilance in 1827, and sheriff
         of Prince Edward County in 1837. He was known for his
         agricultural experimentation and contributed to the Farmers
         Register, an agricultural journal. He died at his home in
         Prince Edward County in 1838.</p>
      <p>Charles Woodson married Nancy Jackson about 1803 and they
         had six children, only one of whom married and had children.
         Mary Thompson Woodson, the eldest child, married Nathaniel
         Venable, whose name is inscribed in the Woodson ledger. They,
         in turn, had two daughters, Nannie B. Venable, whose name is
         also inscribed in the ledger, and Mollie Venable the only
         grandchildren of Charles Woodson and Nancy Jackson.</p>
      <p>Charles Woodsons' parents were Tarleton Woodson, who was
         born in 1754 in Henrico County, and Anne Van Der Veer of Long
         Island, New York. Tarleton Woodson was a major in the
         Continental Army during the Revolution and a British prisoner
         of war on Long Island, where he met his wife. After the war
         they settled in Prince Edward County and had two sons, Charles
         and Tarleton. In 1794 Tarleton Woodson (senior) was married a
         second time, to Anne Friend.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Charles Woodson Manuscript Collection consists of a
         manuscript orderly book, 50 scrapbook pages of newspaper
         clippings, eight loose manuscript pages, and an early handmade
         lace cap.</p>
      <p>The orderly book dates from 1814 to 1820. It contains
         battalion and regiment orders, records of the commissions and
         resignations of officers, including the commissioning of
         William Venable, records of expenditures for medical care and
         arms for the battalion, and an account of provisions purchased
         for the battalion while it was encamped at a location he
         refers to as "Camp Carters, near Richmond." It contains
         information about daily camp life for a militia batallion
         called to duty during the war of 1812 and the administration
         of a unit of the Virginia militia.</p>
      <p>The eight loose manuscript pages contain regimental orders
         from 1815 and miscellaneous accounts and receipts from the
         period 1804 to 1836.</p>
      <p>The scrapbook pages consist of 50 pages of newspaper
         clippings that were probably kept by Nannie W. Venable,
         Charles Woodson's granddaughter, whose name is inscribed in
         the front of the book. They include historical accounts of
         Revolutionary war battles, contemporary of accounts of early
         Civil War battles, poetry, and articles on religion and
         manners.</p>
      <p>The collection also includes a handmade lace cap that may
         have belonged to someone in the Woodson or Venable
         families.</p>
