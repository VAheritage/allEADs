          <head>Biographical note</head>
          <p>Katherine Allen is a professor of Human Development at Virginia Tech. Originally from
            Baltimore, Maryland, she completed studies at the University of Connecticut and Syracuse
            University before joining the Virginia Tech faculty in 1989. Allen came to Tech as one
            of the first ‘out’ lesbians and following her arrival, she became a vocal activist for
            LGBTQ rights both within the University and throughout the state of Virginia. Her
            research has focused on children of LGBTQ families, including the effects of
            relationship dissolution and legal custody rights. In the 1990s, Allen raised two
            children in a lesbian relationship and founded a lesbian mothers group with her partner.
            Her family became a ‘poster family’ for LGBTQ community, both locally and nationally,
            before she separated from her partner in the early 2000s. Allen continues to fight for
            legal protections and employee benefits for LGBTQ families at Virginia Tech and around
            the world.</p>

          <p>In her oral history, Katherine Allen discusses her activism, her relationships and
            personal identity, her experiences as part of a ‘lesbian poster family’ and as an ‘out’

            Wallace Hall on the Virginia Tech campus. Laura Keith was the interviewer and Sara

          <p>Luther Kennedy Brice, Jr. was born and raised in Spartanburg, South Carolina. He earned
            a bachelor’s degree from Harvard, a master’s from Dartmouth, and a Ph.D. from Duke
            University. Brice began working at Virginia Tech as assistant professor of chemistry in
            1954. He earned tenure two years later and became a full professor in 1966. He served as
            professor of chemistry and Acting Head of the Chemistry Department in 1966-67. He
            received both of Virginia Tech’s prestigious teaching awards. In 1961, he was awarded
            the University Wine Award that recognizes a history of university teaching excellence
            and involves automatic induction into the Academy of Teaching Excellence. In 1966, he
            was the first winner of the University Sporn Award for Teaching Introductory Subjects.
            He took early retirement in 1986 when he moved to Washington, D.C. and taught as an
            adjunct professor at American University. During his years at Virginia Tech, Brice
            taught 23,593 students in freshman chemistry, physical chemistry, and principles of
            chemistry. He was also known as “Merlin the Magician” when he donned the blue cape made
            for him by his students and presented his chemical magic show.</p>

          <p>In this first oral history, Brice discusses how one had to be underground about being
            gay during his student years and through much of his time as a professor at Virginia
            Tech. Until the 1970s being homosexual was not discussed. He comments on the
            difficulties faced by gay faculty and students. The interview was conducted by Tamara
            Kennelly on October 24, 2014 at Innovation Space on the Virginia Tech campus.</p>

          <p>Jo Ann (Murphy) Underwood pioneered tolerance of sexual minorities on the Virginia Tech
            campus. She and her family came to Blacksburg in the mid-1970s. She worked as a
            registered nurse at Virginia Tech’s Student Health Services and was appointed the
            university’s first health educator in January 1979. A strong advocate for women’s
            issues, safe sex, birth control, and tolerance of sexual minorities, she started the
            peer education program at Virginia Tech in the mid-1980s. Her columns in the Collegiate
            Times helped educate students about various health issues. She served as an advisor to
            the gay students’ group, Lambda Horizon. At one time she was known as the “Condom Queen
            of Virginia Tech” because of her diligence in working to prevent sexually transmitted
            disease. In June 2014, she was named Ally of the Year at the sixth annual Lavender
            Ceremony for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender graduates and their allies. After
            the ceremony, it was announced that the award would henceforth be called the Underwood
            Ally of the Year Award.</p>

          <p>John Gray Williams is a Career Advisor in Career Services at Virginia Tech. From 2005
            to 2008 he also attended Virginia Tech as an undergraduate student in the Bachelor of

            first came to Virginia Tech, working on events such as the Freedom to Marry Day, Gay?
            Fine by Me Rally, and the LGBTA Relay for Life. As a member of the faculty, he has
            organized a yearly LGBTQ networking reception and has served as a trainer for the
            SafeZone program. In his role in Career Services, he is a passionate social justice

          <p>The interview was conducted on October 28, 2014 at John Gray Williams’s home in
            Blacksburg, VA. The interviewer was Whitney Wright and she was assisted by Damon
            Kinmond. There was limited time for the interview and there are moments within the
            interview where discussion of the time and Williams’s evening plans can be heard. The
            interview lasts almost two hours. It begins with a description of Williams’s family and
            their social dynamics and proceeds into his early experience and understanding of his
            sexuality and his motivations for choosing to be closeted. The interview then moves into
            his time at Tidewater Community College where he was first able to research
            homosexuality and the history of the LGBTQ civil rights movement. He then discusses his
            decision to transfer to Virginia Tech to pursue a career in Landscape Architecture and
            his decision to come out to his family. A significant portion of the interview is
            concerned with his involvement with the LGBTA at Virginia Tech and the variety of
            protests and events he participated in while completing his undergraduate degree. Then,
            he discusses his decision to attend the University of Delaware to pursue student affairs
            while remaining close enough to Blacksburg to maintain a relationship with a student at
            Virginia Tech. He then describes his return to Virginia Tech as a faculty member and the
            work he has done to support the LGBTQ community and other marginalized populations since
            returning. Finally, he discusses broader issues affecting the LGBTQ community beyond the
            fight for marriage equality.</p>
