<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>R. A. Scott held the title of <title render="doublequote">overseer of &#x005B;rail&#x005D; roads</title> in Augusta County, Virginia, during the late nineteenth century.  While no vital information exists on Scott, personal data can be gleaned from his diary documenting the years 1877 to 1882.  In addition to his duties for the railroad, Scott was also a committed farmer and grew corn, rye, and wheat, in addition to maintaining hogs, cows, chickens and honey bees.  Scott also dedicated much time to his family, as evident in his prolonged maintenance of his "Papa's" field.  Religious devotions also figured prominently in Scott's life.  Scott and family members, Mary and Bettie, regularly heard the sermons of various (likely itinerant) preachers.  Although no record links Scott to a particular railroad company, the frequent mentions of trips to Harrisonburg, Virginia, indicate that his employer was likely the B&amp;O.
