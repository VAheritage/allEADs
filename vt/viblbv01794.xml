            <p>The Richards-Woody Family Papers contain Civil War-era correspondence of King David Richards, photographs, obituaries, legal documents, and family history records pertaining to the Richards-Woody family of southwest Virginia.</p>
            <p>Correspondence, 1862-1863, 1992-1993, includes photocopies and transcriptions of Civil War correspondence written by King David Richards to his wife, Harriet Love Richards, while he served in the 57th Virginia Infantry Regiment of the Confederate Army. In his letters, Richards details the movements of his regiment as part of the Army of Northern Virginia and their participation in the battles at Fredericksburg, Petersburg, Drewry's Bluff, and Suffolk. Additionally, there are letters from Robert Krick, an historian with the National Park Service, written to a Mrs. Daphne Woody discussing Richards' letters and his service in the 57th Virginia Infantry. Krick also discusses the question of Richards's final resting place after dying on the field of Battle at Gettysburg. A letter from Jack Huber written to Mrs. Daphne Woody discusses information in the Richards letters pertaining to the battles of Fredericksburg and the march to and from Fort Powhatan.</p>
