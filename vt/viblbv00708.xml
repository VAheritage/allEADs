      <head>Biographical and Historical Information</head>
      <p>Marcus B. Warner was a drummer in Company K of New York's 184th Volunteer Infantry
                Regiment during the Civil War. When he enlisted, he was twenty-two years old and 5ft
                6in tall with blue eyes, a fair complexion, and dark hair. Previous to his short
                army career, he was a harness maker in business with his father in Volney, New York.
                He also worked as a Sunday school teacher and was very active in community and
                church activities, such as the local temperance society. Warner was deeply religious
                and enjoyed singing. He had a sister named Ett and a brother named Gus, who was
                enlisted in New York’s 5th Corps and served as a Hospital Assistant in City Point,
                Virginia, in 1864.</p>
      <p>Warner was enlisted in Phoenix, NY on September 1st, 1864 for one year; he was
                credited to his hometown of Volney. The next day, he mustered into service in
                Oswego, NY. The commissioned officers of his company were George Wetmore, Captain;
                Edgar F. Morris, First Lieutenant; and John H. Gilman, Second Lieutenant. On
                September 16th, Company K went to defend Bermuda Hundred, Virginia. The company also
                served at City Point and Harrison’s Landing in Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This Collection contains one diary written by Marcus B. Warner in 1864, a transcript,
                and photocopies of his Muster Rolls and a card numbers list containing information
                from 1864-1865.These later items list basic information such as rank, physical
                characteristics, bounty paid, and dates of enlistment.</p>
      <p>The diary is written in a green Allings &amp; Cory pocket diary. In addition to
                describing his life as a soldier, Warner also chronicles his previous civilian life
                and the Union army recruitment process. Writing as a civilian, his common discussion
                topics include the weather, his daily schedule, fluctuating gold prices, local and
                national politics and elections, war news, and local community and church events. A
                notable entry on August 6th gives insight to his political sentiments:</p>
      <p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The Copper Heads are getting to be quite bold they are spewing out their
                        venomous treason against the Government at times when I hear them talk it
                        almost makes my blood boil with rage I fairly hate the sight of them and
                        there is many those who we would expect better things from.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>After Marcus mustered into service in September of 1864, his descriptions shift to
                daily camp life and more in-depth war news that is sometimes accompanied by
                newspaper clippings. A humorous entry on October 4th details a false alarm around
                camp, in which a guard mistook a lone dog for an enemy attack. Warner also provides
                considerable insight into the religious life of a Union soldier. On September 11th,
                he bears witness to a mass group conversion:</p>
      <p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>I saw a gathering off at one side [....] they were holding a prayer or
                        speaking meeting there was an opening in the center where those who wished
                        steped fow- erd and confessed their and decla ired themselves on the side of
                        the Lord it was very good meeting the spirit as God was there motivation was
                        then given to those who wished religion to step forward, some twenty persons
                        stepped forward praying was then offered and meeting adjourned until eve</p>
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>Warner also goes in depth about the army's practices concerning disease, death, and
                funeral processions. On October 26, he writes:</p>
      <p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Mr. teague a member of Co C. a merchant of Hannibal Oswego Coun who had been
                        very sick [....] He suffered much all night nearly to the time he died He
                        was sensiless when he died At 3 oclock P.M. funeral of Mr. Teague and Mr

                        brick mansion of this plantation) a solemn tune was then played by fife
                        &amp; drum and mourners marched down to the graves (which were down near the
                        river shore) they were then lowered in their graves three volleys were then
                        fired over their graves. previous to this a few verses were read from the
                        bible and a few remarks made and a prayer offered by Elder Davis procession
                        then returned to camp, all feeling rather soleme </p>
