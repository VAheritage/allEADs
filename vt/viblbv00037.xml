      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>Cynthia Ellen Elizabeth Virginia Addington was born in
         Coeburn, Wise County, Virginia, on 12 December 1898. Her
         father, James L. ("Dot") Addington, owned a "racket," or
         mercantile, store in town. Cynthia attended Virginia Intermont
         College in Bristol and graduated in 1918 with a teacher's
         degree in voice, harmony and history of music. She married Roy
         Gilley Boatwright in 1919, and gave birth to her only child, a
         daughter, Ida Virginia Frances, in 1921. Her husband worked as
         a cashier at the First National Bank and then at Cynthia's
         father's store. From 1943 to 1965 he was the Coeburn
         Postmaster.</p>
      <p>
Soon after her marriage Boatwright turned her
         energies toward volunteer work, a passion that proved
         consistent throughout her life. In the 1920s and 1930s she was
         active in such local clubs and groups as the Methodist
         Missionary Club, the Woman's Society of Christian Service, and
         the Coeburn Women's Club. As chair of the Christian Social
         Relations Committee and Local Work, she taught Bible Class at
         the Colored Church every second Sunday. She was involved in
         the Children's Home Society. She was on the executive
         committees of the Virginia Cancer Foundation and chapel fund
         of the Industrial Farm for Women. She served on the advisory
         council of the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood.</p>
      <p>
 But her
         activities were not just limited to club work. She was the
         first woman in Wise County to run for public office and served
         on the Coeburn town council from 1934 to 1938.</p>
      <p>
 Beginning in
         the late 1930s CAB became increasingly involved in the
         Virginia Federation of Women's Clubs. She was President of her
         local district women's club from 1935 to 1938. In 1938 she was
         elected Vice- President of the VFWC. The pinnacle of her VFWC
         career was when she was President in the war years of 1941 to
         1944. She was the first Southwest Virginia woman to be
         President of that organization. During her years as President
         the VFWC turned its attention to the war effort, by donating
         ambulances to the Red Cross, encouraging women to volunteer
         for civil defense, conservation, and nursing services, and
         supporting the USO. Her theme was "Let us rise up and build."</p>
      <p>

         Other activities of the 1940s included being appointed in 1941
         by Governor James H. Price to the State Defense Council, and
         serving from 1944 to 1947 as chair of the General Federation
         of Women's Clubs Aviation Defense Board. She was president of
         the Coeburn Woman's Club from 1945 to 1946 and President of
         the Wise County Federation of Women's Clubs from 1944 to 1947.</p>
      <p>

         Although she was born a Baptist, Boatwright became a Methodist
         after her marriage, and she actively applied her energies to
         the church all her life. She played the piano for Sunday
         church and funeral services throughout her lifetime. From 1947
         to 1951 she served as President of the Big Stone Gap district
         of the Women's Society of Christian Service. In 1960 she
         headed a fund drive for additions to buildings at the district
         Methodist Camp.</p>
      <p>
 When Virginia Polytechnic Institute merged
         with Radford College in 1944 the composition of the Board of
         Visitors changed from fifteen to sixteen members, with four of
         these to be women. Boatwright was appointed in December 1944
         as one of these first four women on the VPI-Radford College
         Board of Visitors, where she served until 1953.</p>
      <p>
 Boatwright
         worked strenuously for the Democratic Party in the late 1940s
         and 1950s. She was a member of the Democratic State Central
         Committee and chair of the Virginia Ninth District Democratic
         Party Women's Division, and delegate tot he 1952 and 1956
         National Democratic Conventions. From 1954 to 1958 she was the
         Virginia representative to the National Democratic Advisory
         Committee on Political Organization.</p>
      <p>
 Other organizations in
         which Boatwright was involved include the Virginia Heart Fund,
         the Virginia Cancer Foundation, Breaks of the Cumberland Park,
         and the Eastern Wise Chapter of the American Red Cross. She
         also wrote about Coeburn social and community events for the

      <p>
 Boatwright died on 5 March 1973 in Grundy,
         Virginia. She is buried in the Laurel Grove Cemetery in
         Norton, Virginia.</p>
