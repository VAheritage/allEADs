            <p>Elizabeth Wright Ingraham, Fellow of the American Institute of Architects was born in 1922 in Oak Park, Illinois and died on September 15, 2013 in San Antonio, Texas. Her father was John Lloyd Wright, an architect and the inventor of Lincoln Logs toys, and her grandfather was the noted architect Frank Lloyd Wright. She studied architecture with her grandfather at Taliesin in 1937 and with Mies van der Rohe at Armour Institute (now the Illinois Institute of Technology) before attending the University of California at Berkeley. During World War II, Elizabeth served as a draftsman for the U. S. Navy. In 1970, she founded her own architecture firm Elizabeth Wright Ingraham &amp; Associates. That same year, she also founded the Wright-Ingraham Institute, a non-profit educational organization focused on the study of land use and environmental issues.</p>
            <p>Louis Gordon Ingraham (Gordon), was born on March 5, 1915 in New York, New York and died on August 5, 1999 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He studied architecture with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin in 1937 and graduated from the University of Virginia School of Architecture in 1939. During the 1940s, he volunteered with the American Field Service in north Africa and Italy.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth and Gordon met in 1937 while they were both studying with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin. Together, they founded Ingraham &amp; Ingraham, Architects, where they designed more than 90 homes in the 1950s, including the Beadles House, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p>
