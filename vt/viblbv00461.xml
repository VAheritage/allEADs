<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Charles Ravenscroft &quot;C.R.&quot; Nalle (b. abt. 1891?) was the son of Frank Nalle and Sue (Fox) Nalle. He lived in the Somerset, Virginia, area until at least around 1910. His name was found on a New York Passenger List from 1820-1957, possibly accounting for photographs taken in Italy. Nalle was a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania's Towne Scientific School from 1912 to 1913. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in Civil Engineering in 1915.</p></bioghist>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>This photograph album contains 32 photographs taken from 1902 to 1904 with the subject matter ranging from individuals and animals to places in Italy. While the photograph album's origins are in Somerset, Virginia, it appears as though several of the photographs were taken in alternative locations, such as the Vatican. In addition, many of the individuals photographed resided in various towns in the Piedmont Region of Virginia, including Richmond.</p></scopecontent>
