            <p>Levi Hollingsworth, the youngest son of Zebulon Hollingsworth and Anne Maulden, was
                born in 1739 in Head of Elk, MD. The family, settled into Philadelphia, establishing
                themselves as a wealthy family of landholders in Maryland and Delaware. Levi became
                a merchant at the age of eighteen, building one of the most successful merchantile
                firms in Philadelphia. He specialized in the sell of grains, whiskey and flour. Levi
                Hollingsworth's death in 1824 coincided with the decline of Philadelphia as the
                center for the flour industry.</p>
            <p>Levi Hollingsworth was a resolute patriot throughout the Revolution, serving under
                George Washington as the first quartermaster of the Light Horse of the City of
                Philadelphia and participating in the battles of Princeton and Trenton. Marrying
                Hannah Paschall, daughter of a business partner, in 1768. They had eight children:
                Stephen Paschall, Lydia, Paschall, Margaret, Mary, Sarah, Henry, and Stephen.</p>
            <p>The surveyor, Dorsey Pentecost, was one of the leading citizens in southwestern
                Pennsylvania during the Revolutionary period . He is first listed in Frederick
                County, Virginia in 1768. In 1769, he acquired land in Rostraver Township,
                Westmoreland County, and likely moved there with his wife, Catherine Beeler, soon
                after their 1770 marriage. In 1777, he moved to what is now Linden, North Strabane
                Township, Washington County. He represented Washington County in the Supreme
                Executive Council from 1781-1783, and was a judge from 1783-1786.</p>
            <p>Pentecost's name appears in many civil and military records. He was involved in land
                transactions from Illinois to Virginia. A full account of his life is given in Mary
                A. F. Diener's <title render="italic">The Honorable Dorsey Pentecost,
                    Esquire</title> (Fresno, Calif: Pioneer Pub. Co., 1978). She was unable to find
                data on his death. Best evidence is that he died in Kentucky in the spring of
                1793.</p>
            <p>In the 1790 census Pentecost was living in (North) Strabane Township. On November 4,
                1790, the sheriff sold his farm to Levi Hollingsworth, Pentecost's land partner.
                When the 1793 tax list was made about December 1792, he was taxed for 1500 acres, 4
                horses, 2 cows. The last of many civil actions involving Dorsey Pentecost is dated
                March 1793, when his attorney appeared for him.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The collection consists of a manuscript map survey of land in Montgomery County,
                Virginia, belonging to Philadelphia merchant Levi Hollingsworth. The acreage,
                divided into thirty-two tracts of one thousand acres each, is situated on the
                Guyandotte River, a tributary of the Ohio, in present day West Virginia. The
                surveyor, Dorsey Pentecost, attests to the agreeable location of the land, which he
                says is in a fertile area, abundant in game, well-timbered, and producing crops of
                tobacco, among others. He also notes that Mr. Hollingsworth's land is "situated near
                the extensive and fertile settlement of Caintucky." The map is of Montgomery County
                as is was in 1784, not the modern-day Montgomery County.</p>
