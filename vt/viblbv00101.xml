      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>The Price family arrived in Southwest Virginia from Germany
         in the 1740s. James Bane Price (called "Gentleman Jim") was
         born on November 23, 1832, the son of Henry David Price Jr.
         and Anna Marie/Mary. He married Sarah Jane Winston in 1867,
         and they had six children: Lula Belle (b. 1869), Samuel
         Winston (b.1871), Maud (b. 1875), Daisy Winston (b.1883),
         Ferdinand (died young) and Clara Bane (b.1885).</p>
      <p>It is unknown exactly when Price's general store was
         established, but tax records indicate that the store was built
         around 1871. (The oldest account book in this collection dates
         from 1871, but it refers in its first pages to an "old book.")
         It appears from the account ledgers that Price was not only a
         supplier of food and goods, but also of credit, as most of the
         transactions were made through either credit or barter. In
         addition to grocery products, Price sold such items as
         clothing, shoes, tobacco, coal, tools, and drugs. While
         operating as a merchant, Price also engaged in other business
         and in farming.</p>
      <p>Price operated the store until his death in January 1896,
         after which the store was placed in the hands of his son,
         Samuel, who leased the store to others. In 1913, the property
         passed to the hands of Lula Belle, the first of J. B. Price's
         daughters. The store was later bequeathed by Lula to her niece
         Ethel Meisel (Daisy's daughter), and Ethel eventually sold the
         "home place property" (including the store) to Walter L. and
         Patricia Givens Johnson. The store closed many years ago, but
         the building is still standing today (2003) and is rented as a
         residence to Virginia Tech students.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The James Bane Price Account Books--eight in number--span
         the period from 1871 to 1897 and have been divided among the
         following categories: daybooks, account ledger books and
         expenses books. The books contain account information for a
         number of prominent local individuals during the late
         nineteenth century. (Note: Though all of the ledgers are from
         the same business, one of the older books is signed "M. S.
         Price," while another bears the inscription "M. S. Price and
         Helvey." Furthermore, the entries in the last daybook were
         made following Price's death and may be attributable to Samuel
         Price, who operated the store after his father's death.)</p>
      <p>The daybooks provide detailed information of Price's daily
         transactions and the variety of goods sold in the store. The
         notations include date, customer name, quantity and prices of
         products purchased, and transaction total. The books also
         include notations concerning payments made by Price to his
         workers.</p>
      <p>The collection includes one expenses book, with information
         classified in various categories such as bills, amount paid
         for coal, stamps accounts, coal sold, coal shipped, etc. The
         book records the date, name of the person from whom Price
         bought the merchandise, amount paid, and sometimes the type of
         payment (check, fuel, cash, etc).</p>
      <p>The two account ledger books, arranged by costumers' name,
         contain information such us the total customer credits and
         charges, together with other notations.</p>
