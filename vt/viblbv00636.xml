      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Robert E. Marshak was born in 1916 in the Bronx, a borough of New York City. Marshak's
        academic ability was recognized early, and despite their poverty, his family encouraged his
        studies. As a result, he finished James Monroe High School at the age of 15. From high
        school, he enrolled in the City College of New York (CCNY), a tuition-free university that
        served as an exit from poverty for generations of immigrants. After one semester at CCNY, he
        received a Pulitzer Scholarship which provided full tuition and a stipend which allowed him
        to continue his education at Columbia University. College appears to have been a profound
        intellectual experience for Marshak. He initially majored in philosophy and math, and served
        as the dance critic for the school newspaper. In his senior year, he switched to physics,
        and came into contact with Nobel Laureate I.I. Rabi. Rabi was initially skeptical of his
        commitment to physics, but later became a friend. </p>
      <p>Marshak graduated from Columbia in 1936, and went to graduate school at Cornell University
        via a fellowship. At Cornell, he studied with Hans Bethe, who at the time was working on
        problems pertaining to energy production in stars, which later won Bethe a Nobel Prize.
        Marshak wrote his dissertation on energy production in white dwarf stars. His basic
        conclusion was confirmed about forty years later when the white dwarf orbiting Sirius came
        into view. He completed his Ph.D. degree in 1939 at the age of 22.</p>
      <p>Jobs were hard to come by in the late 1930s, especially for Jewish scientists for whom
        positions were limited by quotas. Marshak nonetheless was able to get a one- year, non-
        renewable position at the University of Rochester. Here he met, among other notables, Victor
        Weiskopf, the future director of CERN, the nuclear accelerator facility in Geneva,
        Switzerland. During this time a tenure-track position opened in the Physics Department at
        Rochester which Marshak received.</p>
      <p>Teaching at the University of Rochester was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II.
        Marshak became involved in the war effort, as did many scientists at the time. Initially, he
        worked on developing radar in Boston, Massachusetts, then on the British atomic bomb project
        in Montreal, Canada. In 1943, Marshak married Ruth Gup, a school teacher in Rochester. Later
        he joined the Manhattan Project which was developing the American atomic bomb in Los Alamos,
        New Mexico. At Los Alamos, Marshak was a deputy group leader in theoretical physics, a rank
        which allowed him to be privy to the overall strategy of atomic bomb creation. </p>
      <p>After the war, Marshak returned to the University of Rochester, where he moved quickly
        through the ranks. He become a chair professor (the Harris chair) and the head of the
        physics department in the 1950s. He was very active as a researcher, and was a participant
        at the famous Shelter Island Conference where he proposed the two-meson theory. During his
        fourteen year chairmanship the Physics Department at Rochester became one of the top 10 in
        the country, and a recognized center for advanced research in physics. </p>
      <p>During his years at the University of Rochester, Marshak became intensely interested in
        international science. He felt that scientific cooperation was an important first step in
        the quest for global peace. In 1956, he was a member of the first delegation of
        approximately six American scientists to visit the USSR after the death of Stalin. Marshak
        met the leaders of the Soviet Physics community, including Lev Landau. He made more trips to
        the USSR during the 1950s (U.S. State Department debriefings after these trips are in the
        files), and became an acknowledged expert on Soviet science.</p>
      <p>During the 1950s, Marshak established the "Rochester Conference", considered by his
        colleagues to be one of his most significant achievements. The conference evolved over the
        years into "The International Conference on High-Energy Physics." The Rochester Conference
        was instrumental in bringing together scientists from around the world, and served as a
        model for the establishment of international conferences in other fields. One of the most
        challenging aspects of the early conferences was the attempt to bring real Eastern European
        and Soviet physicists (as opposed to KGB agents) to the meetings. This effort required
        Marshak to carry out intense negotiations with the U.S. State Department and with members of
        Congress. His other involvement in international science included participation in the
        establishment of the International Center of Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy, and the
        International Foundation for Science in Sweden.</p>
      <p>Events at the University of Rochester received lots of publicity, and brought Marshak to
        the attention of the search committee looking for a new president for CCNY. They approached
        him with an offer to become president, just at a time when his social conscience had been
        roused. He accepted the offer and became CCNY President in 1970, just at a time when the
        college was undergoing a vast change in demographics.</p>
      <p>Typical of Marshak, he put his full effort into the struggle to redefine the college and
        bring it through these crises. In addition to improving the quality of several departments,
        he established important new programs such as the Biomedical Center and the Legal Center,
        raised the funds for a new performing arts center (the Leonard Davis Center), and pushed
        through the construction of a 150 million dollar academic complex. He also became involved
        in the debate about national educational policy and "Science and Public Policy", delivering
        many speeches on the subject. He also served on the board of directors for Harlem Hospital
        and for Colonial Penn Insurance Company. In the end, the success of his efforts was
        recognized by the naming of the 14-story science building on campus after him. The stress of
        his position at CCNY took a toll on his health, and he suffered a minor stroke during a
        confrontation with a student group. The stroke effected his balance for the remainder of his
        life.</p>
      <p>After nine years at CCNY, his desire to return to physics led him to accept an offer as
        University Distinguished Professor at Virginia Tech, and he and Ruth moved to Blacksburg in
        1979. During this period, he became President of the American Physical Society, the
        principle organization of physicists in the United States. Typical of his modus operandi, he
        took an activist approach to the job, using the weight of the society to debate the Reagan
        Administration on the issue of placing an anti-ballistic missile system into space,
        popularly known as "Star Wars."</p>
      <p>Marshak officially retired as a professor at the age of 75. During the last five years of
        his life, he worked intensely on a book, entitled <title render="italic">Conceptual
          Foundations of Modern Particle Physics</title>. He finished the final corrections on the
        manuscript the day before he died. When he dropped the manuscript in the mailbox, he turn to
        his wife and said, in a joking voice, "It's done. Now I can die." The next day, December 23,
        1992, he died in an accidental drowning on a trip to Mexico.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection consist of Marshak's professional and personal papers, detailing his career
        as university professor in physics at the University of Rochester and Virginia Tech, member
        and leader in several scientific institutions, and president of the City College of New
        York.</p>
      <p>The first series contains materials on the Shelter Island Conferences (1947-1949) and his
        administrative and correspondence files on the Rochester Conferences on High-Energy Physics
        (1950-1957), which he founded. After 1957 the conferences were held under the sponsorship of
        the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) and Marshak's files from the
        conferences from 1958 to 1970 are included. The collection also has correspondence files on
        IUPAP (1953-1972) and on the Commission on High Energy Physics (1958-1963); photographs
        (1950-1970); US-USSR relations (1956-1966); and a photocopy of an oral history interview
        done by Charles Weiner (1970). </p>
      <p>The rest of the collection, is divided into 10 series, which remain in original order.
        These series consist of correspondence, notes, reports, files, speeches, newsclippings,
        autographs, photographs, transcripts, proceedings, interviews, and other personalia. Topics
        cover the national and international development of high-energy physics, meetings and
        symposia, and scientific committees; awards and prizes, administration and education,
        science in the Eastern Bloc and Third World, and the scientist as social activist or
        citizen-scientist. The collection also includes correspondence, publications and articles,
        and more related to Marshak's books and other writings, teaching and academic administrative work, and research. </p>
      <p>Individual series concern specific time periods of Marshak's career, including his work at
        the University of Rochester, City College of New York (CCNY), and Virginia Tech (VPI). The
        series also document his involvement in numerous organizations, including the American
        Physical Association, International Center of Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy, and the
        International Foundation for Science in Sweden.</p>
      <p>Of special note are several items and files with other well-known physicists, including
        Hans Bethe, George Sudarshan, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Susumu Okubo, Abdus
        Salam, Victor Weisskopf, Enrico Fermi, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Mildred Dresselhaus, Richard Feynman, and a letter from Albert Einstein.</p>
