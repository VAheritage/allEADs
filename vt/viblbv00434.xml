      <head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
      <p>In the early-twentieth century, mock weddings were conducted as a form of entertainment. In addition to the entertainment value of these mock weddings–many times conducted with children or actors–these staged weddings also served the purpose of recalling popular elements of weddings as opposed to the new direction of the "modern" wedding. These weddings emphasized aspects of weddings, such as the use of the classic white color scheme. While these ceremonies placed emphasis on the traditional wedding practices, they also served as a means for criticizing the "materialism and pomp" associated with wedding ceremonies.</p>
      <p>For more information on mock weddings, see: Freeman, Elizabeth. <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Wedding Complex: Forms of Belonging in American Culture</title>. Durham: Duke University Press, 2002.</p>
      <p>The stamp on the frame, "Davis, Roanoke, VA," may indicate the photograph was taken by George C. Davis, a prominent Roanoke photographer. Davis owned a studio in Roanoke at least as early as 1904. Later in his life, he converted part of his home to a darkroom, allowing him to work there.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>The mock wedding photograph from Roanoke, Virginia, features eighteen children–eight boys and ten girls. These children are dressed up as traditional members of a wedding party, such as the bride, groom, flower girl, and preacher. This photograph suggests that mock weddings, such as this one, were well-planned, containing large flower bouquets, dresses and suits for the children, and even an oriental rug. </p>
