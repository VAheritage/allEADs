<head>Biographical/Historical Information 
</head>
<p>In the early-twentieth century, mock weddings were conducted as a form of entertainment. In addition to the entertainment value of these mock weddings&ndash;many times conducted with children or actors&ndash;these staged weddings also served the purpose of recalling popular elements of weddings as opposed to the new direction of the &quot;modern&quot; wedding. These weddings emphasized aspects of weddings, such as the use of the classic white color scheme. While these ceremonies placed emphasis on the traditional wedding practices, they also served as a means for criticizing the &quot;materialism and pomp&quot; associated with wedding ceremonies.</p>
<p>For more information on mock weddings, see: Freeman, Elizabeth. <title render="italic">The Wedding Complex: Forms of Belonging in American Culture</title>. Durham: Duke University Press, 2002.</p>
<p>The stamp on the frame, &quot;Davis, Roanoke, VA,&quot; may indicate the photograph was taken by George C. Davis, a prominent Roanoke photographer. Davis owned a studio in Roanoke at least as early as 1904. Later in his life, he converted part of his home to a darkroom, allowing him to work there.</p></bioghist>

<head>Scope and Content

<p>The mock wedding photograph from Roanoke, Virginia, features eighteen children&ndash;eight boys and ten girls. These children are dressed up as traditional members of a wedding party, such as the bride, groom, flower girl, and preacher. This photograph suggests that mock weddings, such as this one, were well-planned, containing large flower bouquets, dresses and suits for the children, and even an oriental rug. </p></scopecontent>
