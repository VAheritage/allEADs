            <p>DeWitt Clinton "DC" Wolfe Jr., a native of Big Stone Gap, Va., attended Virginia Polytechnic Institute from 1917 to 1921 and was a civil engineering major who moved through the ranks in the corps of cadets, from a private during his freshman year to captain of the cadet corps band and president of the Lee-Wise-Scott Club his senior year. From the 1921 yearbook, The Bugle: "DeWitt Clinton, better known to us as 'Captain,' is one of our budding civil engineers of no mean ability. His efforts in behalf of the band have been unlimited and the results a pleasure to everyone. His ability as a musician is of the highest order, and as a mail clerk, no postcards went unread nor boxes unopened. Although 'D.C.' rules the band with an iron hand, his absolute fairness and impartiality to all have won for him many friends...."</p>
            <p>After graduating, Wolfe worked as a bridge engineer in Missouri, eventually becoming a partner in Sverdrup and Parcel Corporation, a civil engineering firm that focused on bridge design. Wolfe retired in 1966 in Atherton, California. He died in 1991 at the age of 92.</p>
