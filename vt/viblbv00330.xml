<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The United States Military Railroads were created in 1862 with legislation empowering the Federal government to take possession and operate railroads as necessary to support the Union war effort. The seized railroads were consolidated into the United States Military Railroads to insure the efficient movement of troops and supplies, with operating money issued by the Quartermaster's Department. The U.S.M.R. was gradually liquidated beginning in August 1865, as the railroads were returned to their original owners and government-produced equipment and rolling stock were sold.
