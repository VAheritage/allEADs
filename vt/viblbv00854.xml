      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Hugh C. Ledgerwood, son of Anderson and Hester Gish Ledgerwood, was born on January 8,
        1862, in Montgomery County, Virginia. Ledgerwood lived for many years in Utah and other
        western states before returning to Virginia, and he lived at various times in Montgomery,
        Pulaski, and Wythe counties. Information in his account book indicates that he was living in
        Pulaski County in 1915. Ledgerwood married Josie Akers in 1919. The 1920 census describes
        Hugh C. Ledgerwood as a 48-year-old resident of Montgomery County, employed at a sawmill.
        Also in the household is 25-year-old Josephine Ledgerwood. Hugh C. Ledgerwood died on
        January 26, 1923, and is buried in Pulaski County's Max Creek Cemetery.</p>
