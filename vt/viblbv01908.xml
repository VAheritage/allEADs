      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Madison Thompson Lawson was born in Meadows of Dan, Virginia, in 1827. He was the oldest of
        six sons born to William (a minister) and Anna L. Thompson Lawson. In 1857, Lawson married
        Ruth Turner (1839-1925). The couple had three children: Martha Ann (Mayberry) (1860-1958),
        Claiborne Wilson (1861-1954), and Turner Madison (1877-1965). </p>
      <p>Lawson enslisted with Company G, 21st Regiment, Virginia Cavalry and, by his letter,
        suggests he held the rank of sergeant and was perhaps promoted as high as major. However,
        records of the regiment are lacking in information on him other than to note his company and
        his discharge after being elected surveyor of Patrick County. </p>
      <p>Lawson died in November 1893 and is buried in the Lawson Family Cemetery in Meadows of
        Dan.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The collection contains a letter from Madison T. Lawson to his family, written in Lee
        County, Virginia, on March 28, 1864. Lawson writes of his current location and activities of
        his regiment, including a recent incursion into Kentucky to capture a mule train. He talks
        about the difficulties of the terrain, the loss of ground to the Union army, and the
        scarcity of water in parts of Virginia and Tennessee. He closes with an update on some
        mutual family and friends serving in the war and with a request for news from home. </p>
      <p>The letter is written to "Dear Brother &amp; Sister" and is addressed to E. Payne and
        family. Records suggest Lawson had five brothers, but no sisters, so the precise
        relationship between Lawson and his correspondants is unclear. His father was a minister,
        though, and is it possible he was using this in a religious context. </p>
