</head>
<p>Doina Marilena Cioc&#x00E3;nea was born (March 13, 1951) in Bucharest where she graduated from high school in 1970. She enrolled in the Institute of Architecture receiving her diploma in 1976. She worked for ten years (1976-87) in the Institute for Design and Construction of agricultural and food production industries. She designed storage facilities for vegetable and fruits, canning factories, wineries, slaughterhouses for chickens and rabbits, flour mills and bakeries, built in towns and villages around the country. Thereafter, she became principle architect of <title render="doublequote">Carpati</title> firm (1987-90) in Bucharest for the construction of the Romanian <title render="doublequote">House of the Republic,</title> lately renamed the <title render="doublequote">People's house</title> where the Parliament shares this enormous building with an international conference center, museums, etc. Dona Cioc&#x00E3;nea also designed administrative buildings and worker's housing for many provincial towns.
</p>
<p>As state design organizations closed down during the 1990's Doina Cioc&#x00E3;nea became the chief architect of the company "PREDA" (1992-94) and then of the firm <title render="doublequote">MACONZ International</title> Ltd. designing mostly private residences. After obtaining a diploma and license in Urban Design and Planning from the Institute of Architecture (1994) she established her private practice (1996). She continued her studies on environmental techniques at <title render="doublequote">Unesco-Coustea</title> University in Bucharest and received a fellowship in 1996 to specialize in policy and ecology in Madrid, Spain. Cioc&#x00E3;nea was also involved in planning and ecological studies for the town council of Bucharest, resulting in her report titled  <title render="doublequote">Study of Ecological Urban Design for the lake's shores of the river Colentina in Bucharest</title> of 1966-98.
