                <p>The Virginia Academy of Science Archives deposited in the VPI&amp;SU Libraries'
                    Special Collections Division are largely the result of the preservation of the
                    records by the individual officers, section heads, and committee chairs.
                    Throughout the Academy's history these records have been stored in various
                    places around the state. Their being brought together in 1981 in one location is
                    largely the work of the VAS Archives Committee under the leadership of Dr. Boyd
                    Harshbarger. Donations have been made continuously since that time by the
                    Academy and individual members.</p>

            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>In 1923, one hundred and thirty-five scientists chartered the Virginia Academy of
                Science (VAS) and held their first annual VAS meeting in Williamsburg on April 26th.
                The Academy has continued to meet annually since then (except during World War II),
                bringing together scientists from every field throughout the state. The records of
                the Virginia Academy of Science have been arranged in chronological order by year,
                then by those principal officers who maintained large quantities of records, and by
                the scientific sections and committees whose records have survived.</p>
            <p>The early records of the Academy can be attributed largely to the efforts of E. C. L.
                Miller who was the only officer (secretary and treasurer) to serve continuously,
                1924-1949. During these years, he corresponded widely for the entire Academy,
                maintained committee reports, compiled the yearly programs, and saw that formal
                records were published annually in the <title render="italic">Proceedings</title>.
                The strength of the VAS Archives lies largely in the historic intuition of such
                officers, section heads, or committee chairs who maintained the files. Some files
                are much more complete than others. The early records of the Research Committee, for
                example, contain applications, papers submitted for consideration for the annual
                award, and records of the efforts of J. Shelton Horsley to raise an endowment to
                support these awards which were later named in his honor. More recent files are
                limited to minutes and annual reports. The Geology Section has perhaps the most
                complete set of records of section activities, especially during the leadership of
                William M. McGill. The activities of other committees and sections are often
                preserved in the Council’s records, however, while the<title render="italic">
                    Proceedings</title> through 1966 and/or the annual meeting files often contain
                reports of committees and sections.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The Virginia Academy of Science Archives includes VAS publications dating from
                1939-present. These include such in-house works as <title render="italic">Review of
                    the First Ten Years of the Research Committee</title> (1939) and <title
                    render="italic">Announcement and a Challenge</title> (1946?) as well as the
                    <title render="italic">Future</title> ( 1950). The Academy has also published
                periodicals throughout its history. <title render="italic">Claytonia</title> was the
                first VAS journal (1934-39), followed by the <title render="italic">Virginia Journal
                    of Science</title> (1940-43) and the <title render="italic">Virginia Journal of
                    Science, New Series</title> (1950-present) (VJS). The <title render="italic">
                    Journal</title> often focuses on special topics such as the issue which was
                devoted to the 1964 Virginia Symposium on Human Resources (held during the annual
                VAS conference); "Early Virginia," articles on scientific and cultural development
                in Virginia, was especially reprinted for the 350th anniversary of the founding of
                Jamestown in 1957; and in 1969 the <title render="italic">VJS</title> carried a
                series of articles on Virginia's Dismal Swamp area. The Publications Committee
                records show that the Dismal Swamp series was the culmination of the work of many
                Academy members who had originally hoped for a separate work to be published like
                the James River Basin study. The Flora Committee of the Botany Section also
                periodically publishes a newsletter which became known as <title render="italic">
                    Jeffersonia</title> in 1980; the Archives contain only scattered issues (11)
                from 1969-70, 1980. The Academy Archives also has copies of directories, brochures,
                and membership fliers which the VAS has published since about 1946.</p>
            <p>The VAS Archives also includes manuscript and published versions of various Academy
                histories; especially interesting are the early versions by Ivey Foreman Lewis
                (first VAS president) and E. C. L. Miller. The Academy Archives contains quite
                extensive records of the work of Isabel Boggs and George Jeffers to coordinate the
                efforts of members to record the Academy's past as well as the resulting master's
                thesis of Harry J. Staggers, <title render="italic">History of the Virginia Academy
                    of Science, 1925-1927</title> (College of William and Mary, 1966). This history
                of the VAS appeared in the Winter 1968 issue of the <title render="italic">Virginia
                    Journal of Science</title> and in Spring 1973 the <title render="italic">
                    Journal</title> carried the more recent VAS history, 1948-1972, to commemorate
                the fiftieth anniversary of the Virginia Academy of Science charter.</p>
            <p>The Academy Archives also includes correspondence, report, and minutes of section and
                of ad hoc and standing committees, annual financial statements, photographs and
                clippings, by-laws, and constitutions, records of special projects such as the
                visiting scientists program (supported by National Science Foundation grants), the
                Virginia Institute for Scientific Research and the Virginia Museum of Science.</p>
