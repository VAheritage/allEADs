        <p>The Virginia Academy of Science Archives deposited in Special Collections are largely the result of the preservation of the records by the individual officers, section heads, and committee chairs. Throughout the Academy’s history these records have been stored in various places around the state. Their being brought together in 1981 in one location is largely the work of the VAS Archives Committee under the leadership of Dr. Boyd Harshbarger. Donations have been made continuously since that time by the Academy and individual members.</p>
        <p>Additional donations are expected in the future.</p>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>In 1923, one hundred and thirty-five scientists chartered the Virginia Academy of Science (VAS) and held their first annual VAS meeting in Williamsburg on April 26th. The Academy has continued to meet annually since then (except during World War II), bringing together scientists from every field throughout the state. The records of the Virginia Academy of Science have been arranged in chronological order by year, then by those principal officers who maintained large quantities of records, and by the scientific sections and committees whose records have survived.</p>
      <p>The early records of the Academy can be attributed largely to the efforts of E. C. L. Miller who was the only officer (secretary and treasurer) to serve continuously, 1924-1949. During these years, he corresponded widely for the entire Academy, maintained committee reports, compiled the yearly programs, and saw that formal records were published annually in the 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Proceedings</title>. The strength of the VAS Archives lies largely in the historic intuition of such officers, section heads, or committee chairs who maintained the files. Some files are much more complete than others. The early records of the Research Committee, for example, contain applications, papers submitted for consideration for the annual award, and records of the efforts of J. Shelton Horsley to raise an endowment to support these awards which were later named in his honor. More recent files are limited to minutes and annual reports. The Geology Section has perhaps the most complete set of records of section activities, especially during the leadership of William M. McGill. The activities of other committees and sections are often preserved in the Council’s records, however, while the 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Proceedings</title> through 1966 and/or the annual meeting files often contain reports of committees and sections.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Virginia Academy of Science Archives includes VAS publications dating from 1939-present. These include such in-house works as 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Review of the First Ten Years of the Research Committee</title> (1939) and 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Announcement and a Challenge</title> (1946?) as well as the 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Future</title> ( 1950). The Academy has also published periodicals throughout its history. 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Claytonia</title> was the first VAS journal (1934-39), followed by the 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Journal of Science</title> (1940-43) and the 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Journal of Science, New Series</title> (1950-present) (VJS). The 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Journal</title> often focuses on special topics such as the issue which was devoted to the 1964 Virginia Symposium on Human Resources (held during the annual VAS conference); "Early Virginia," articles on scientific and cultural development in Virginia, was especially reprinted for the 350th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown in 1957; and in 1969 the 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">VJS</title> carried a series of articles on Virginia’s Dismal Swamp area. The Publications Committee records show that the Dismal Swamp series was the culmination of the work of many Academy members who had originally hoped for a separate work to be published like the James River Basin study. The Flora Committee of the Botany Section also periodically publishes a newsletter which became known as 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Jeffersonia</title> in 1980; the Archives contain only scattered issues (11) from 1969-70, 1980. The Academy Archives also has copies of directories, brochures, and membership fliers which the VAS has published since about 1946.</p>
      <p>The VAS Archives also includes manuscript and published versions of various Academy histories; especially interesting are the early versions by Ivey Foreman Lewis (first VAS president) and E. C. L. Miller. The Academy Archives contains quite extensive records of the work of Isabel Boggs and George Jeffers to coordinate the efforts of members to record the Academy’s past as well as the resulting master’s thesis of Harry J. Staggers, 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">History of the Virginia Academy of Science, 1925-1927</title> (College of William and Mary, 1966). This history of the VAS appeared in the Winter 1968 issue of the 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Virginia Journal of Science</title> and in Spring 1973 the 
                <title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Journal</title> carried the more recent VAS history, 1948-1972, to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Virginia Academy of Science charter.</p>
      <p>The Academy Archives also includes correspondence, report, and minutes of section and of ad hoc and standing committees, annual financial statements, photographs and clippings, by-laws, and constitutions, records of special projects such as the visiting scientists program (supported by National Science Foundation grants), the Virginia Institute for Scientific Research and the Virginia Museum of Science.</p>
