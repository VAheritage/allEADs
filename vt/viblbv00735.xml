            <p>Edward B. Hicks was an attorney based in Lawrenceville, VA. He was born on July 11,
                1789 and died on November 27, 1858 at the age of 69. Edward was the eldest son of
                Daniel (died in November of 1857 at age 99) and Fanny Hicks (died on April 12,
                1840).</p>
            <p>On November 3, 1822, Edward married Elizabeth Stone, the daughter of Governor and
                Senator David Stone of North Carolina. The couple had many children together, but
                unfortunately Edward survived most of them. However, one son named David Stone
                Hicks, who was born on May 11, 1826, attended the University of Virginia and became
                a lawyer and judge. Edward also survived his wife, who died on Febuary 12, 1837
                after a long illness; in the Hicks family diary, he describes her as, “my most
                affectionate and devoted wife.”</p>

            <p>This collection consists of a single letter from Edward B. Hicks in Lawrenceville, VA
                to William Townes in Clarksville, VA. The last page serves as the letter's envelope
                and contains a postage mark, sending address, and the remnants of a red wax
                seal.</p>
            <p>The letter's contents rant against President Polk's presidential administration,
                blaming him for not helping Virginia's debt as well as for having the audacity to
                try to go to war with Britain over the Oregon Territory. The following quote is
                indicative of Hicks' contempt for Polk: "Does he believe that he can bully England,
                when Napoleon with Europe at his back, could neither alarm or conquer her."</p>
