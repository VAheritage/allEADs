      <p>Hermann Christian Niemeyer, son of William A. and Sarah Howard Chandler Niemeyer, was born
        on February 2, 1856. Niemeyer matriculated at Virginia Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College
        from Portsmouth, Virginia in 1875 and seems to have graduated in 1878. He married Marie
        Louise Hook in St. Louis in 1882. Census records indicate that the couple moved with their
        oldest daughter back to Portsmouth, Virginia in late 1883 or 1884. The Niemeyers had four
        more daughters and lived on Swimming Point in Portsmouth. Through the 1880s and 1890s,
        Niemeyer tried his hand at several different business enterprises. His obituary reported
        that he had engaged in the commission business, the book business, and the real estate and
        rental business. He had also been connected with the <title render="italic">Portsmouth
          Star</title> as a "special man and route agent." City directories of the late 1880s list
        him as a brick manufacturer. Niemeyer's business connections led him, in 1896, to be elected
        secretary and treasurer of Portsmouth's board of trade, a position in which he continued to
        serve until his death, which occurred in his home on July 17, 1899. He was buried in
        Portsmouth's Cedar Grove Cemetery.</p>

      <p>This collection contains the papers of Hermann C. Niemeyer, a student at Virginia
        Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College (now Virginia Tech) during the mid-1870s. The
        collection includes two leaves detailing Niemeyer's expenses while at school in 1876 and

        commending Niemeyer for "attaining to an average of three-fourths in all his examinations
        for the session of 1875-76," and a photographic portrait of Niemeyer in his cadet
        uniform.</p>
