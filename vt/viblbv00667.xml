            <p>Hicks House refers to Clover Hill Tavern; constructed in 1819 by brothers Alexander
                and Lilburne Patteson, it is the oldest structure in the village of Appomattox
                Courthouse. It was a restaurant, inn, and bar for travelers along the
                Richmond-Lynchburg stage road. In 1846, the court house and subsequent scene of the
                surrender of General Lee's army was built across the road. During the evening of
                April 10, 1865, the Union army set up printing presses in Clover Hill Tavern to
                produce more than 30,000 paroles for surrendered Confederate soldiers. After the
                war, the village fell into financial ruin and the courthouse was largely forgotten
                by those except veterans; however, town reservation efforts started in the 1920's. </p>
            <p>Although Wilson Hix owned the tavern during the war, E.G. Hix later took over
                proprietorship in the time period between the end of the Civil War and the 1892 fire
                which destroyed the courthouse. J.W. McKinney took over the proprietorship of the
                tavern after the fire. E.G. Hix was married three times. His first marriage was in
                1940 to Birta Tibbs; his second wife was Eva Tibbs and his third wife was Miss Cobbs
                of Franklin. </p>
