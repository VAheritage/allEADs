<head>Historical Information
</head>
<p>The New River Mineral Company, incorporated in New York, conducted mining operations in Wythe County, Virginia. Sources indicate that the company purchased a charcoal-fired furnace at Ivanhoe, Virginia around 1882, and replaced it with a new coke furnace around 1887. In 1884, Joshua Hendricks was serving as the company's president; Jordan L. Mott, vice-president; and W. C. Van Doren, superintendent and agent at the works. The plant, which would continue in production for 25 years, produced up to 25,000 tons of iron per year and operated in conjunction with a foundry owned by the company. By 1907 the Ivanhoe Furnace was being operated by the Ivanhoe Furnace Company.
