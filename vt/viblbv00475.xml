<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The Dr. C.D. Eubank of Vinton, Virginia, was most likely Dr. Charles D. Eubank. Eubank was born c.1860. Around 1892, he married Minnie (Linwood Fox?) (b. abt. 1862). By 1920, they were living in Roanoke, Virginia. </p></bioghist>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a">
<head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The memoranda books contain one page dedicated to each day of the year on which doctors were able to document their services. Dr. Charles D. Eubank used the memoranda books infrequently in 1909 and 1911; however, he became increasingly consistent in his notes between 1912 and 1916, with the exception of 1914. His notes typically list the name of the individual receiving treatment, or, in many cases, the name of the head of the household. Eubank's notes were not specific as to the condition of the patient for the most part, but the fee charged to each patient was listed along with the date of the visit. Eubank's memoranda books also noted whether payment had been received for his services.</p>
<p>Eubank's memoranda books were sponsored by Gude's Pepto-Mangan&mdash;a &quot;cure all&quot; medication containing rather large amounts of manganese and iron. The memoranda books typically feature one physician's biography at the front of the book and a suggestion for the treatment of various ailments on each page (usually involving Pepto-Magan). This product, as well as the memoranda books, was distributed by the M.J. Breitenbach Company of New York City.</p></scopecontent>
