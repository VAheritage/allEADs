            <p>Henry Dodge Ayre, the son of George S. and Mary Ann Ayre, was born in Upperville
                (Fauquier County), Virginia in 1856. He graduated from Virginia Agricultural &amp;
                Mechanical College (now Virginia Tech) with a degree in agriculture and mechanics in
                1876. Ayre married Julia Peck in Salem, Virginia in 1879. The 1880 census describes
                Henry D. Ayre as a 24-year-old farmer, living in Loudoun County, Virginia with
                24-year-old wife Julia. In 1894, Ayre was granted U.S. patent number 512,573 on a
                device for marking corn rows. By 1910, he was living in Cleveland, Tennessee and
                engaged in farming and the lumber business. Henry Ayre died on October 3, 1939.</p>
            <p>Clayton Emmett Ayre, son of Henry and Julia Peck Ayre, was born in Fauquier County,
                Virginia on August 5, 1880. He attended Virginia Agricultural &amp; Mechanical
                College and Polytechnic Institute (now Virginia Tech) in 1898/1899 and 1899/1900. A
                1935 alumni directory lists him as a special student, graduating in 1902. By 1905,
                Ayre was living in Cleveland, Tennessee, and the 1910 census shows him living in the
                home of his parents and working in the lumber business. Also in the household was
                the younger Ayres' wife, Matilda Elizabeth Chappelear Ayre (1878-1962), whom he had
                married in Salem, Virginia in 1907. The couple continued to live with Ayers' parents
                through 1920, with their only child, Nanny Josephine Ayre (born in 1910). By 1929,
                Ayre was living in Guild, Tennessee and employed as construction superintendent for
                the Tennessee River Electric Power Company. He later worked for the Tennessee Valley
                Authority. Following retirement, Ayre worked on the family farm at Cleveland,
                Tennessee. He died there on November 18, 1967.</p>

            <p>This collection contains college memorabilia of father and son Henry D. and Clayton
                E. Ayre, who attended Virginia Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College (now Virginia
                Tech) in the late 19th century. The collection contains the elder Ayre's notes from
                various lectures and an examination certificate of proficiency. The collection also
                includes Henry Ayre's drawing of a shop engine and an "1876" armband, probably used
                by him during a school reunion or other function. From Clayton Ayre, the collection
                contains two cadet kepis and a photograph of the school's shop class, circa
                1899.</p>
