<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Edward Dillion was born to Colonel Edward and Frances Anne Polk Dillon, in 1871. The colonel formed a limestone company in Virginia that persists today as E. Dillon &amp; Company. His son Edward, was the second of seven children. Four of the five Dillon brothers attended VAMC: James Royal from 1886 to 1888, Edward and Lucius Polk from 1888-1890, and Francis Cunningham from 1904-1905. It is unclear whether or not Edward Dillon graduated from VAMC. In October of 1896, he married Susan S. Pendleton (b. 1877). They had five children: Edward, Edmund, Mary, William, and Susan. </p></bioghist>

<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The collection contains a letter from Dillon to his mother, Frances, February 22, 1889, and a VAMC cadet coat and trousers (removed to University Archives). The letter, on VAMC letterhead, details the postponement of exams due to a large number of sick students. Dillon also mentions that &quot;Eddie&quot; (his cousin, Edward Wright) is still sick, too; that he has written to his brother Roy (James Royal); and that he has learned to dance since the reorganization of the dance club.</p></scopecontent>
