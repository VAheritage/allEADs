      <head>Biographical Note: Emilius A. Baughman</head>
      <p>Emilius Allen Baughman was born to George and Mary Jane (Greer) Baughman in 1844 in
        Maryland. The family relocated to Salem, Virginia, in 1847, and later to Richmond, in 1856.
        At the age of 18, in 1863, he followed his father and older brothers, and enlisted in the
        Confederate army with 38th Battalion, Virginia Light Artillery (Read's). His brother Greer
        was already a member of the unit. Following the Civil War, he and his brothers took over
        their father's stationary business, forming Baughman Bros. in Richmond. In 1873, Emilius
        married Mary Barney in Richmond, and the couple had 8 children. Emilius died in 1915 and is
        buried in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note: Greer H. Baughman</head>
      <p>Greer H. Baughman was born to George and Mary Jane (Greer) Baughman about 1840, in
        Maryland. The family relocated to Salem, Virginia, in 1847, and later to Richmond, in 1856.
        Greer enlisted with the 21st Regiment, Virginia Infantry (along with two of his brothers),
        in April of 1861. In July 1861, he transferred to the Hampden Artilley, with which his
        youngest brother would later enlist. Greer was wounded in June 1864 and spent over a month
        in the Confederate hospital at Chimborazo, before returning to his regiment for the
        remainder of the war. Greer married Francis H. (Willie) Richardson (b. 1845, d.before 1900)
        on August 15, 1866. They had one daughter, May (1868-1952). Following the Civil War, he and
        his brothers took over their father's stationary business, forming Baughman Bros. in
        Richmond. Greer died in 1907 and is buried in the Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond,
        Virginia.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection contains two letters written by brothers and Confederate soldiers Greer and
        Emilius Baughman. The letters were written April 5, 1862, by Greer and July 26, 1863, by
        Emilius. Both letters were written to their mother, Mary Jane Greer Baughman, at home in
        Richmond.</p>
      <p>The April 5, 1862, letter contains a description of the Battle of Kernstown, Virginia
        fought March 23, 1862. This battle was a Confederate defeat and the first battle in
        Stonewall Jackson's famous 1862 Shenandoah Valley Campaign. The letter also contains
        descriptions of skirmishing around Edinburg, Virginia, between Turner Ashby's Confederate
        cavalry and Union forces. The letter of July 26, 1863, written by Emilius, described the
        retreat of the Army of Northern Virginia after the Battle of Gettysburg, particularly the
        experiences during the retreat of Emilius' unit, the Hampden (VA) Artillery.</p>
