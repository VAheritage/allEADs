      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>According to <title render="italic">Wythe County, Virginia: a Bicentennial History</title>,
        George D. Brown served as a deputy county treasurer with W. H. Spiller in 1906. George D.
        Brown, 17, appears in the 1880 census within the farm home of Rufus and Margaret A. Brown in
        Wythe County's Black Lick District. County records show that a George D. Brown and Martha M.
        Groseclose were married in the Lutheran church at Marion, Virginia, in 1892. Subsequent
        census records show that George and Martha Brown continued to live and farm in Wythe
        County's Black Lick District. The Browns had no children and both were still living in Wythe
        County as late as 1930.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists of a single ledger maintained by George Brown, a Wythe County,
        Virginia assistant county clerk and also apparently a church clerk or treasurer. The ledger
        contains a page detailing credits to the county's special funds for 1906 and a list of
        delinquent taxpayers for that year. The majority of the ledger, however, details the
        transactions of various church funds, apparently those of the Lutheran Synod of Southwest
        Virginia. Included are account statements showing the synodical apportionments of individual
        churches, as well as account statements for various church projects and missions, such as an
        orphanage, home and foreign missions, assorted foreign relief funds, Elizabeth College, a
        theological seminary, and various educational sponsorships.</p>
