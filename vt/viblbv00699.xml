      <head>Biographical/Historical Information </head>
      <p>James A. Branch was a confederate soldier, a prisoner of war, and a shop clerk. He
                was mustered into service on June 5, 1862, and fought for the Confederate States
                Army until his unit was unknowingly surrendered to the Union Army on April 6, 1865.
                Until his parole on June 24 of that year, Branch was a prisoner of war at Point
                Lookout Camp, Maryland. Following the war, he ran a struggling shop with another man
                named Ned. </p>
      <p>Branch was very close with his family. He often thought of his parents and visited
                his cousins during his breaks. Subsequently, Branch became inconsolable after the
                death of siblings Elizabeth (died on Oct 29, 1865) and Percy. In his free time,
                Branch enjoyed reading and taking nature walks. Throughout the war, Branch struggled
                with religious doubts and feelings of spiritual inadequacy; after the war, he
                physically struggled with sickness, most likely Consumption (Tuberculosis).</p>
      <p>Point Lookout Camp, where Branch was held as a prisoner of war between April and June
                of 1865, was located on the tip of St. Mary's County, MD, where the Potomac River
                meets the Chesapeake Bay. Officially called Camp Hoffman, it was established on
                August 1, 1863, by Brig. Gen. Daniel H. Rucker. Initially, it was designed to hold
                10,000 prisoners. Isolated, easily protected, and located next to a large hospital,
                Point Lookout Camp became the largest Union prison; it sometimes held up to 20,000
                prisoners at a time and around 50,000 prisoners in total passed through its gates
                during the war's entirety. Prison conditions were poor: men were placed in outdoor
                pens lined with sand that contained only tents to protect them from the elements.
                Disease, water pollution, scant rations, extreme temperatures, and poor drainage
                were additional difficulties prisoners faced. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content </head>
      <p>This collection contains two diaries written by James A Branch and two letters he
                received from his family. </p>
      <p>The first diary is an 1865 account written in a repurposed 1864 Denton &amp; Wood
                pocket diary. Branch describes daily life as a soldier: he records such activities
                as meals, guard duty, purchases, books read, correspondence, and sermons. A
                characteristic entry is one written on September 20, 1865: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Feel dull stupid gloomy. Have so much cold can hardly breathe. Early is reported
                    leaving the valley stupendous achievements are on foot, and I feel anxious for
                    the results. My God grant a happy tune rid of all our troubles.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The second diary covers the years of 1865 to 1867. It includes descriptions of
                Branch's surrender, his life as a prisoner of war, and the details of his parole.
                The diary also covers Branch's experiences after the war: he laments about his ill
                health, poor business, and the death of two of his siblings. Some notable entries
                include May 22, 1865: "Not a rumor after this morning God in mercy grant that we may
                speedily be released from this miserable prison This evening Gen Grant and staff
                passed through out pen in ambulances." On April 3, 1865, Branch wrote: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>This is perhaps the sadest day of all the year to the Southern heart a most
                    memorable day! One that decided the fate of R and the Confederacy May God grant
                    not for over. How many here made poor by this step necessarily taken by our
                    beloved chief May it prove for the better though we cannot see through the void
                    as yet Just now our eyes were made to witness and our ears to hear negrew troops
                    marching down our street cursing all white persons.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Of the two letters in this collection, one is missing the page's top half and is
                unsigned and undated. A prayer is written on one side of this letter and the other
                side contains a portion of a letter talking about family happenings. The other
                letter is written by Branch's father on July 10, 1864; he encourages his son not to
                lose faith.</p>
