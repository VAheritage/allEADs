      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>In 1957, Ann A. Hertzler received a B.S. in Home Economics Education from Pennsylvania
        State University. She taught high school Home Economics for two years. In 1960, she
        completed a Master of Science in Nutrition at the Drexel Institute of Technology. Between
        1960 and 1966, she taught at the Drexel Institute of Technology and Northern Illinois
        University, and spent a year as a dietitian in England. She then pursued a Ph.D. in
        Nutrition at Cornell University, completing her studies in 1973. From 1970 to 1980, Hertzler
        was a professor and Extension Specialist at the University of Missouri-Columbia. In 1980,
        she joined the faculty at Virginia Tech as a professor of Human Nutrition, Foods, and
        Exercise, and as a Foods and Nutrition Extension Specialist. She retired in 2001 and was
        granted Professor Emerita status. Dr. Hertzler died in 2014.</p>
      <p>Throughout her extensive career, Ann A. Hertzler wrote numerous articles and presentations,
        many of which are represented in this collection. She wrote and revised many Virginia
        Cooperative Extension publications relating to, as well as developed resources for, adult's
        and children's nutrition. She received national and regional awards, including a Fulbright
        Scholarship in 1989-1990 and the American Dietetic Association's Award for Excellence in
        Dietetic Education (1999). Hertzler also worked with many national, regional, and local
        professional societies, especially the American Association for Families and Consumer
        Science, the Society for Nutrition Education, and the American Dietetic Association. In
        addition, she was involved in the development of the Peacock-Harper Culinary Collection at
        Virginia Tech Special Collections and served on M.S. and Ph.D. committees for students at
        the University of Missouri-Columbia and at Virginia Tech.</p>
