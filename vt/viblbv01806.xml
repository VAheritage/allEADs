            <p>The Virginia Central Railroad Company started as the Louisa Railroad Company. Formed in 1836, the Louisa Railroad Company built several railroad lines in south and central Virginia. In 1850, the company name was changed to the Virginia Central Railroad Company. The company's trains and tracks became vital to the Confederacy during the Civil War, transporting men and supplies throughout Virginia. Most of the rail lines belonging to the Virginia Central Railroad Company were destroyed by order of Generals Ulysses S. Grant and Phillip Sheridan. Although heavily damaged at the end of the Civil War, the railroad was rebuilt and fully operational by the end of 1865. The Virginia Central Railroad Company merged with the Covington and Ohio Railroad in 1868 to form the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad.</p>
