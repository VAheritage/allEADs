            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Peyton B. Gravely was born in Henry County, Virginia, in 1935. In 1860, he was living with his parents and at least 8 siblings, including Marshall F. Gravely enlisted in April 1861 and served through the end of the war with Price's Company, Virginia Light Artillery (Danville Artillery) and the 42nd Regiment, Virginia Infantry. He was promoted five times, the last leading to his being a captain of Company F from January 1863. Gravely was wounded three times at the battles of Gettysburg, Wilderness, and Fisher's Hill.</p>
            <p>By 1880, he was a tobacco manufacturer in Danville. He was married to Mary Walter and had at least five children: Kate W., Peyton, James G., Mary, and Nannie Daisy. Gravely died in Virginia in 1928.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The collection includes two letters by Peyton B. Gravely: one to a sister and another to a friend, written during 1863. The first part of the letter to his sister is devoted to a vehement attack on the Reynolds family. The letter suggests the family instigated a rumor about Gravely (the nature of which is never shared). In addition to a brief paragraph on news about family and friends, Gravely also writes about a recent review of General Ewell's troops by Jefferson Davis, in which he intends to wear the Yankee sword he captured at Chancellorsville. The letter to "Joe" details war news, news from home, and Gravely's desire to join the navy.</p>
