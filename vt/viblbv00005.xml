      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p><persname>Henry Goddard Thomas</persname>was born in Portland
         Maine, on April 4, 1837. At the age of twenty-one he graduated
         from Amherst and then studied law and was admitted to the
         Maine bar. He was enlisted in the 5th Maine as a private in
         April, 1861, and was commissioned captain in June. This
         command fought at the battle of First Manassas, after which,
         on August 5, 1861, Thomas accepted a commission as a captain
         in the newly authorized 11th U.S. Infantry. He was on
         recruiting duty until the summer of 1862 and did not join his
         regiment until autumn. Thereafter his principle contribution
         to the war effort was the recruitment and organization of
         Negro troops, with whom he was associated with until the end
         of the war. He was commissioned colonel first of the 79th U.S.
         Colored Infantry and then of the 19th Colored Infantry, taking
         command of the latter on January 16, 1864. Thomas is said to
         have been the first officer of the Regular Army to accept a
         colonelcy of colored troops. (681) He was assigned to
         Ferrero's IX Corps's division of Negro troops at the beginning
         of U.S. Grant's Overland campaign and was present during all
         of the battles incident thereto, including the battle of The
         Crater. On November 30, 1864, Thomas was made a brigadier
         general of volunteers and transferred to Benjamin F. Butler's
         Army of the James, where he commanded a brigade of four
         colored regiments in the XXV Corps. At the end of the war he
         was brevetted through all ranks to that of brigadier general,
         U.S. Army and major general of volunteers, but he was mustered
         out of volunteer service on January, 1886, as a captain of the
         11th infantry, a grade which he occupied for the next decade.
         He became major of the 4th Infantry in 1876 and two years
         later transferred to the paymaster's department with the same
         rank. On July 2, 1891 he went on the retired list, and on
         January 23, 1897, he died in Oklahoma City. His remains were
         returned to Portland for burial.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>From the letters to Henry Goddard Thomas one can gather
         that the General was a respected individual for his
         involvement with the black community. As an activist Thomas
         received various letters from individuals seeking to help
         educate the recently released slaves. Thomas was particularly
         active in the construction of churches for the black community
         as well as instruction for black ministers. Louis Hensen
         writes to thank the General for money for the construction of
         a Methodist church and informs him of the construction
         progress. A letter from Byron Greenough updates the progress
         of one such organization, the Institute for the Instruction of
         Colored Ministers in Virginia and Southern States. A letter
         from Rev. Commodore D. Hurt commends the work that government
         has done for the education of the "poor and downtrodden race."
         The letter also updates the General on the status of a black
         school in Russell County VA. Some letters also express the
         frustration of Thomas' peers over the treatment of blacks. The
         letter from P.S. Reeves dated June 17, 1868 relates a story
         involving "Regulators" and a black school teacher in Danville.
         An interesting letter from G.R. Rosselton, dated December 24,
         1869, includes a brief synopsis of slavery in America.</p>
      <p>Henry Goddard Thomas was also a man of considerable social
         standing as he had ties with the Virginia Governor Shelby, and
         his father and brother also appear to be quite active in the
         North in the same activities as Thomas. In politics the
         General was a member of the Grant and Colfax Club.</p>
