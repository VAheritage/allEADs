        May of 1942, she married Louis I. Jaffe (1888-1950). During the 1960s and 1970s, Alice Jaffe
        was an art teacher at Old Dominion College (later Old Dominion University). She died in

      <p>Louis Isaac Jaffe was born to Philip and Lotta Kahn Jaffe in February of 1888. Jaffe was
        raised around Durham, North Carolina, attending Durham High School and Trinity College
        (later Duke University). He began his career as a newspaper writer and editor in college,
        later going to work for the <emph render="italic">Richmond Times-Dispatch</emph>. He served
        in France during World War I and after the war, became the editor of the <emph
          render="italic">Norfolk Virginian-Pilot</emph>, the position he would hold until his
        death. During this lengthy term as editor, he had a reputation as a defender of civil
        liberties and a promotor of the arts. He helped write key elements of legislation against
        lynching in Virginia (passed in 1928). In 1920, Jaffe married Margaret Davis; the couple
        divorced in 1939. In the mid-1930s, Jaffe helped found the Norfolk branch of Virginia Union
        University (now Norfolk State University). In 1942, Jaffe married Alice Cohn Rice. In 1950,
        Jaffe suffered a heart attack and died. He is buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery in Norfolk,
        Virginia.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note: J. J. Lankes</head>
      <p>Julius John (J. J.) Lankes was born in 1884 in Buffalo, NY. He began working as a draftsman
        in 1902, but spent the majority of his professional life known for his woodcuts. In 1914, he
        married art student Edee Maria Bartlett (1885-1958). Between 1915 and 1924, the couple had
        four children. Lankes' career as an artist spanned decades, during which he created woodcuts
        and illustrations for authors, among others. In addition to Sherwood Anderson, he worked
        with Robert Frost and Beatrix Potter. Lankes wrote and illustrated <title render="italic">A
          Woodcut Manual</title>, published by Henry Holt in 1932. In 2006, The University of Tampa
        published a new edition of this book with selected letters and other writings, edited by
        Welford Dunaway Taylor. (A copy of the 2006 edition is housed in Special Collections. A copy
        of the 1932 edition is available at the University Libraries' Art &amp; Architecture
        Library.) In addition to his illustrations and work as an artist, Lankes taught at Wells
        College from 1933 to about 1940. From 1943 to 1950, Lankes worked for the reproduction
        section of the National Advisory Council for Aeronautics (NACA, later NASA). He retired in
        1951 and died in April 1960.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection contains two main sets of materials: Correspondence between Louis I. Jaffe
        and J. J. Lankes from 1930 to 1942 and correspondence between Alice Jaffe (Louis' widow) and
        J. B. Lankes (J. J.'s son) from 1980 to 1985. In addition, there is a small folder of notes
        and letter excerpts created by J. B. Lankes in the early 1980s. </p>
      <p>The majority of the letters are from Louis Jaffe to J. J. Lankes, represented by original
        letters, photocopies, and/or transcripts. These letters document their personal friendship,
        working relationship, and larger creative, literary, and political circles. Themes in their
        correspondence include Sherwood Anderson and his works, Lankes relocation to New York to
        take a job at Wells, visits with each other, and professional collaborations. </p>
      <p>July 11, 1933, Louis Jaffe to J. J. Lankes: "Sometime in August I hope to knock off for a
        couple of weeks of rest. Maybe I will climb into the old Ford and wander west. This idea is
        stirring in my head-how would you like to join me in a gypsy expedition for a week? My plans
        are nebulous, but it might be possible to drive up to Marion and see Sherwood. He has just
        taken a bride-Eleanor-and they are to live at Ripshin, the stone keep that be built with the
        proceeds of Dark Laughter."</p>
      <p>January 12, 1937, Louis Jaffe to J. J. Lankes: "'Spring Twilight' is one of the finest
        things you've done. I am proud to have a print of it and send you warm thanks. Excepting
        Wyeth, I think I must have by this time the best collection of Lanky-anna in private
        hands."</p>
      <p>In addition, the collection contains 19 letters to and from Alice Jaffe and J. B. Lankes,
        discussing the distribution of Louis Jaffe and J. J. Lankes materials at different
        repositories, the whereabouts of original works (including items discussed in the Louis-J.J.
        correspondence), and Sherwood Anderson materials (both before and after Eleanor Anderson's
        death). </p>
