<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>The Randolph family is a prominent family of Virginia, with influential roots back to the mid-seventeenth century. James Innes Randolph, a congressional clerk in the Virginia House of Representatives married Susan Armistead Randolph in 1828. They had eight children together: Peyton, Innes, John, Robert, Mary, Wilton, Anne, and Sue Randolph. The bulk of the collection consists of correspondence between Sarah Randolph and her son, Peyton. Peyton Randolph graduated from Columbian College (now George Washington University) in Washington, D.C. Peyton became an engineering officer in the confederate army after beginning his career with an Alabama rifle unit. Peyton Randolph worked for several railroad companies before the war and was the General Manager of the Richmond &amp; Danville railroad until his death.
