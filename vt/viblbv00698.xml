      <abstract label="Abstract">The collection contains eight handwritten diaries chronicling John
        Harville's experiences during the Civil War. From August of 1861 to January of 1864 Harville
        served with the 7th Wisconsin Regiment, Company F. He then transferred to the Veteran
        Reserve Corps for the remainder of his term, ending in July 1864. His diaries include
        details and stories from camp life, largely around Washington, DC, and Baltimore, MD.
        Suffering from chronic "congestion of the lungs," Harville spent Autumn 1862 to Spring 1864
        in hospitals. He continued to document this period with stories of daily life, chores, staff
        and volunteers at the hospitals, and war news. </abstract>

      <head>Biographical/Historical Information</head>
      <p>John McBride Harville (also spelled Harvill) was born in Illinois on January 29, 1839. His
        family seems to have moved to Beetown, Wisconsin, around 1843, though other records indicate
        this may have occurred later. Before the early death of his mother when he was five, his
        parents appeared to have had three other children: Caroline (later Young), who Harville
        refers to as "Carrie" or "Cary" in his diaries; William; and Elizabeth (later Nickerson),
        who Harville calls "Lib." For several years, he lived with a foster family (the Sargents).
        His father, William, remarried and had five more children. By the start of the Civil War,
        Harville was living with the Batie family in Tafton, Wisconsin. </p>
      <p>Although Tafton did not have enough men to raise its own company, volunteers from the area,
        including Harville, joined others to form Company F, 7th Regiment Wisconsin Infantry in
        Lancaster during the summer of 1861. Harville served primarily in and around Washington, DC,
        Virginia, and Maryland. Chronic health problems resulted in his spending most of September
        1862-August 1864 in hospitals in Baltimore, Maryland, though he continues to report on his
        personal experiences, as well as war news. In January of 1864, he transferred to the Veteran
        Reserve Corps until he mustered out in August 1864.</p>
      <p>In October 1864, he married Harriet E. Trine (1846-1916), who he had known since before the
        war. As early as his first diary in 1861, he records having received letters from Hattie and
        Lizzie (presumably her sister) Trine. They settled in Wyalusing and had five children:
        William A. (1865-1894), Annie Laure (b. 1867), Frank D. (1869-1883), Edgar R.(b. 1872), and
        John M., Jr. (b. 1879). Following the war, Harville was both a farmer and a newspaperman. He
        died from pneumonia in Wisconsin at age 74 in June 1913.</p>
      <p>The 7th Regiment, Wisconsin Volunteers, along with the 2nd Wisconsin, 6th Wisconsin, and
        19th Indiana, formed the "Iron Brigade" in the autumn of 1861. In October 1862, the 24th
        Michigan joined the brigade. The Iron Brigade was under the immediate command of Brig. Gen.
        Rufus King and made up a part of the 3rd Brigade of the Army of Potomac, under Major General
        McDowell. Near the front of the battle at Gettysburg, Antietam, The Wilderness, Second Bull
        Run, and several other major campaigns, over the course of the war, the Iron Brigade
        suffered the greatest losses in proportion to its numbers. </p>
      <p>Additional biographical information is available in the collection. More information on
        Wisconsin Regiments can be found on the Wisconsin Historical Society website: <extref

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection contains eight original diaries, as well as transcripts and additional
        biographical information. Harville's diaries chronicle his experiences with the 7th
        Wisconsin Regiment during 1861 and 1862. He spent much of 1863 and 1864 in Newton University
        Hospital, and later Jarvis Hospital, in Baltimore, MD, facing chronic illness.</p>
      <p>Clearly intended for an audience, the diaries contain short addresses to the "Reader" at
        the beginning and end, often including an apology for his poor grammar and spelling. Largely
        self-educated, Harville's diaries are surprisingly legible and his phonetic spellings are
        easy to decipher. Most of the diaries also include a list of letters received and written,
        as well as Harville's cash and barter accounts with friends. Several diaries are indexed
        and/or paginated.</p>
      <p>Harville's early entries detail the formation of Company F in Lancaster, Wisconsin, travel
        to Washington, DC, and life in camp outside Alexandria, Virginia. Like many farmers in the
        war, he keeps consistent notes on the weather. He recounts stories of his own adventures
        which more than once landed him in trouble, as well as the exploits of others. He also
        writes of picket and guard house duty, the occasional scouting mission, frequent drills and
        dress parades, and war news. He remains relatively well-informed about the war, at least in
        as much as it related to his experiences and his regiment.</p>
      <p>While spending time in Jarvis and Newton University Hospitals, the content of his entries
        begins to change some. He continues to records war news of note during this period, but the
        emphasis is on the work he does and the social life he develops. His illness is intermittent
        and so he also does chores around the hospital, including cleaning inside and outside the
        buildings, cooking and serving, and running errands. Harville spends a good deal of time
        helping the local women who volunteer at the hospitals, too, which he appears to thoroughly
        enjoy. At least two diaries contain a list of women and young ladies with whom he is
        acquainted.</p>

      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The collection is arranged is two series: Series I: Diaries, 1861-1864 and Series II:
        Transcripts and Biographical Information, 1913, 2010, undated. </p>
      <p>Series I: Diaries, contains all eight original diaries, arranged in chronological order.
        There is some slight overlap of dates in diaries #7 and #8—both diaries contain different
        entries from the Summer of 1864.</p>
      <p>Series II: Transcripts and Biographical Information, includes transcripts of the diaries
        and copies of biographical material (obituaries, family records, and two newspaper columns).
        Transcripts are arranged in chronological order, followed by the biographical material.
        Wherever possible, first names and/or corrected spellings have been added to names Harville
        mentions throughout his diaries, due in large part to the <title render="italic">Roster of Wisconsin Volunteers, War of the Rebellion, 1861-1865</title>
