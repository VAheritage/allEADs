      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>CARY, Chicks in Architecture Refuse to Yield (to Atavistic Thinking in Design and Society), was founded in 1992 as an offshoot of Chicago Women in Architecture by Chicago architects Carol Crandall, Kay Janis, and Sally Levine. The group originally formed as a Chicago-based collective whose goals are to focus attention on the status-quo of women and the position of women in the field of architecture.
</p>
      <p>The group designed and produced an exhibit called "More Than the Sum of Our Body Parts" that was shown at the Randolph Street Gallery in Chicago from June 16 to July 2, 1993. The purpose of the exhibit was to illustrate the many ways that women architects are discriminated against in the workplace by their male colleagues. The exhibit was comprised of sculptural and multimedia installations, focusing on such topics as the sexual discrimination and harassment of women architects, and the glass ceiling said to be limiting the advance of women in architecture.</p>
