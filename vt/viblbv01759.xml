            <head>Administrative History</head>
            <p>Smithey &amp; Boynton, Architects &amp; Engineers, was an architecture firm in
                Roanoke, Virginia, established in 1935 by Louis Phillipe Smithey and Henry B.
                Boynton. The firm closed during World War II for a few years while Boynton and
                Smithey served in the U.S. Army. After Smithey's death in the 1970s, Boynton
                partnered with Kenneth L. Motley, who began his career as a draftsman with the firm.
                In 1992, a year following Boynton's death, Motley acquired Smithey &amp; Boynton and
                renamed the firm Motley + Associates.</p>
            <p>Smithey &amp; Boynton designed several structures over the years, including the
                Christ Episcopal Church, the South Roanoke Fire Station, the Shenandoah Life
                Building, McClanaham Street Office Building, and the American Theater Building, all
                in Roanoke. The firm also designed Lane Stadium at Virginia Tech and the Lyric
                Theatre in Blacksburg. The firm became best known for building public schools, even
                using the same basic layout for numerous schools. Smithey &amp; Boynton had nearly
                150 school design commissions during the period of 1945 thru 1953 in at least 19
                counties and 10 cities.</p>

            <p><emph render="bold">Henry B. Boyton</emph></p>
            <p>Henry B. Boynton was born in West Chicago, Illinois, in 1899 and grew up in Amelia
                County, Virginia. He graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute with a B.S. in
                Agricultural Engineering in 1921 and a B.S. in Civil Engineering in 1923. Boyton
                then spent a year at the University of Illinois in Urbana taking architecture
                classes. He became a registered architect in Virginia in 1930 and later registered
                in West Virginia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>From 1924 to 1928, Boynton worked as a draftsman at Carneal &amp; Johnston,
                Architects &amp; Engineers, in Richmond, Virginia. In 1929, he joined Louis Phillipe
                Smithey, Architect &amp; Engineer, in Roanoke, Virginia, as an associate. In 1935,
                Boynton and Smithey partnered to form Smithey &amp; Boynton, Architects &amp;
                Engineers, in Roanoke. Boynton became senior partner of the firm when Smithey
                retired in 1963.</p>
            <p>Boynton was affiliated with the Virginia Chapter (later the Virginia Society &amp;
                Blue Ridge Chapter) of the American Institute of Architects from 1938 until his
                death. He served on the board of directors in 1952, 1953, and 1956; as
                vice-president in 1954; and as president in 1955. He was a member of the State
                Registration Board for Architects, Professional Engineers, and Land Surveyors, as a
                Governor's appointee, from 1962 to 1972, serving as President of the Board in 1967.
                He received a distinguished service award in 1980 and the Noland Award in 1989, both
                from the Virginia Society &amp; Blue Ridge Chapter of the AIA.</p>
            <p>Boynton served in the Army Corps of Engineers during World War II, rising to the rank
                of Colonel. He was a member of the Virginia Tech Alumni Board of Directors from 1969
                to 1979 and Chair of its Annual Fund Committee from 1973 to 1979. He also served on
                the Board of the VPI Educational Foundation, Inc., from 1978 to 1982. In 1976,
                Boynton received the Virginia Tech Alumni Distinguished Service.</p>
            <p>Boynton died on September 13, 1991, at the age of 92, at his home in Roanoke.</p>
            <p><emph render="bold">Louis Phillipe Smithey</emph></p>
            <p>The son of William Rosser Smithey and Mannie Jane Elizabeth Greene, Louis Philippe
                Smithey was born in Mecklenburg County, Virginia, on June 7, 1890. He earned his
                bachelor and master's degrees at Randolph-Macon College in 1909 and 1910,
                respectively, and was an alumnus member of Phi Beta Kappa there. He was an
                instructor and special student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute from 1910 to 1914
                and a special student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1914 to
                1915.</p>
            <p>Smithey was a registered architect in Virginia and West Virginia. A fellow of the
                American Institute of Architects (AIA), he served as president of the Virginia
                chapter of AIA in 1940. </p>
            <p>Smithey worked as a draftsman and contracting engineer for Virginia Bridge &amp; Iron
                Company in Roanoke from 1916 to 1918. After serving in the army in World War I, he
                was contracting engineer for Virginia Bridge &amp; Iron Company again in 1919 and
                1920. He practiced as Louis P. Smithey from 1920 to 1922, as Smithey &amp; Tardy
                from 1922 to 1927, and again as Louis P. Smithey from 1927 to 1935. </p>
            <p>The Smithey &amp; Boynton partnership formed in 1935 with Henry B. Boynton. Prior to
                World War II, the firm served as consulting architects for the Roanoke City School
                Board and Roanoke County School Board for approximately eight years and handled
                school buildings in Franklin County, Montgomery County, Alleghany County, Pulaski
                County, and the City of Waynesboro.</p>
            <p>While the company was closed during World War II, Smithey served in the U.S. Army as
                Lt. Colonel from 1942 thru 1945. </p>
            <p>Following the war, Smithey &amp; Boynton were commissioned as architects or
                consulting architects on public school work in Virginia valued at approximately $31
                million, distributed in 25 School Divisions of the state. Smithey retired from
                professional practice in 1963. </p>
            <p>On June 11, 1938, Smithey married Dorothy Terrill, and they had daughter Nancy
                Terrill Smithey on March 10, 1940. He and his family lived in Roanoke. Smithey died
                on August 19, 1966.</p>

            <p>The collection contains project files and drawings related to more than 1,500
                residences, churches, businesses, schools, and community buildings, predominantly in
                the Roanoke and Southwest Virginia area, designed by Smithey &amp; Boynton, mostly
                between 1935 and 1957. Materials consist of project files, specifications, framed
                drawings and photographs, and architectural drawings. Records include designs by
                Smithey before he collaborated with Boynton, as well as designs by other firms of
                projects later redesigned by Smithey &amp; Boynton. A small group of materials also

            <p>The collection is arranged in three series: Series I, Biographical Information and
                Organization Records, 1923-1972; Series II, Project Files and Drawings, 1923-1985;
                and Series III, Other Architects-Johnson Associates International, February
                1968.</p>
            <p>Series I: Biographical Information and Organization Records, 1923-1972, includes
                documentation and administrative files on Smithey &amp; Tardy, the firm in which
                Louis Smithey was a partner before the formation of Smithey &amp; Boynton, as well
                as records from Smithey &amp; Boynton. Materials include legal and tax files, forms
                and contracts for clients, biographical and personnel information, and some sample
                plans for school and residential designs.</p>
            <p>Series I: Biographical Information and Organization Records is arranged by material
                type. </p>
            <p>Series II: Project Files and Drawings, 1923-1985, is arranged in two groups by
                material type, project files and folded drawings. Both groups are organized by
                project number. The materials are for designs or renovations by Smithey &amp;
                Boynton. The project files contain a variety of items and vary with each project.
                Materials may include small drawings and maps, contracts, correspondence and memos,
                and other documentation created by the firm or clients. Project files are listed
                with the project number, name, and location. The folded drawings are in boxes,
                organized in project number order.</p>
            <p><emph render="bold">Please note:</emph> Not all projects for which there is a project
