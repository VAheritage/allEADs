      <head>Biographical Information
</head>
      <p>S. Worcester Burrows, son of Palmer and Sophronia Shaw Burrows, enlisted in the 27th New York Infantry, serving as a private. In October 1863, he transferred to the 1st New York Veteran Cavalry, serving as second lieutenant. He was captured in 1864 and held a prisoner of war until his release in February 1865. After the war, he married Jennie Rhodes of Akron, Ohio. The couple had four children (Frederick, Lewis, Mary and Carl) and resided in Ohio.
</p>
      <p>Company C of the 27th New York Infantry was recruited at Binghampton, New York and mustered into Federal service with the rest of the regiment at Elmira on July 9 and 10, 1861. The regiment proceeded immediately to Washington, D. C. and participated in the First Battle of Bull Run just one week later. Attached to 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, 1st Corps, Army of the Potomac, the 97th proceeded in April to the Virginia Peninsula and participated in battles at West Point and Yorktown and the Seven Days Battles. Later, it participated in the battles of Second Bull Run, Antietam and Fredericksburg. Soon after its participation in the Battle of Chancellorsville, the regiment returned at the end of its service to Elmira, where it was mustered out of service on May 31, 1863.

      <head>Scope and Content
</head>
      <p>This collection contains a letter written by Private Samuel Worcester Burrows of Company C, 27th New York Infantry. Writing to "Friend Wheeler" from a camp near Harrison's Landing [Virginia] on August 1, 1862, Burrows states that the regiment is enjoying a rest after heavy marching and fighting. He looks forward to seeing "that wonderful city Richmond, of which there has been so much said" but, in noting the army's previous attempts to take the city, calls it "the worst place to get at I ever saw." He defends the Army of the Potomac from criticism of its activities in the recent Seven Days Battles and claims that the strength of the Confederate Army had been underestimated. Burrows continues with a favorable description of camp health, rations and recruiting.
