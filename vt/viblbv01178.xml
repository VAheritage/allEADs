      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>George William Christopher, son of Van B. and Laura Gilliland Christopher, was born in Texhoma, Oklahoma on September 17, 1908. The younger Christopher later moved with his family to southern Kansas and the Texas panhandle, where he worked variously as a fireman, mechanic, and electrician. In 1933, Christopher purchased a Waco 10 biplane, and the following year, he became a professional flight instructor. Through the 1930s, Christopher continued work as a flight instructor and also barnstormed throughout the area. During World War II, he instructed air cadets at Love Field (Dallas, Texas) before joining the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) in Santa Monica, California, as an engineering test pilot, then went on active duty as a reserve officer with the Army Air Forces. From 1947 until his retirement, Christopher served as a regular officer in the U.S. Air Force. He was awarded numerous medals and honors, including the Distinguished Flying Cross during the Korean War, the Air Medal, and the Air Force Commendation Medal while serving with Allied Air Forces, Southern Europe, a NATO command in Naples, Italy. In 1941, Christopher married Geneva Weatherspoon (1907-1994), and the couple would have one child. Following Christopher's retirement from the U. S. Air Force as a lieutenant colonel, the Christophers lived in El Paso, Texas. George William Christopher died on April 22, 2002 and was buried at Fort Bliss National Cemetery, Texas.</p>
