<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>Ana Uncu studied at the Bucharest Institute of Architecture, graduating in 1976. She began working at the Design Section of Tulcea County (1976-1977) and then moved to Ploiesti to work in this town's Design Studio (1977-1979). She designed apartment buildings for the towns of Tulcea and Ploiesti, a public bath in Busteni, a zoological park in Bucov, and renovated schools and housing. In 1980, Uncu was appointed to the section for metallurgy in Bucharest, designing industrial plants and upgrading existing smelting factories in Bucharest and in provincial towns. As private practice became possible, she joined an architectural design studio (1990) headed by architect Constantin Mihalache designing mostly commercial facilities such as discotechs, restaurants and fast-food places. In 1997 Uncu was employed by the Ministry of Public Works and Regional Development where she became involved in neighborhood preservation and zoning. Her main interest is the preservation of folk architecture and entire villages.
</p>
<p>Uncu is the author of legislative and legal requirements for new buildings and a member of any many commissions for cooperation between different administrations. She serves as a design juror and organizes exhibitions and symposiums. In 1997 she was the consultant for the configuration of bathroom and kitchen furniture at the showroom "Sarmis", and for the planning of the showroom "Domus" promoting new construction materials. Recently, she completed her postgraduate studies in historic preservation and restoration of historic monuments at the Institute of Architecture.</p>
