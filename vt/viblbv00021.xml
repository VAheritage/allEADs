         <p>Lewis Wood was a private in Company K of the 2nd Regiment
         Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, possibly serving as the company's
         cook. He entered service at age 37 as a member of Company K on
         August 24, 1861, and was transferred to Company H on February
         17, 1863. On April 20, 1864, he was transferred to the Veteran
         Reserve Corps.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
            <p>The collection consists of eight letters written by Wood
            to his wife Mary Louisa Wood, in Unionville, Ohio. Seven of
            the eight letters were written in January and February
            1862, from Camp Dennison, Ohio; enroute to Missouri; and in
            Hudson, Platte City, and Kansas City, Missouri. The last
            letter was written on April 9, 1863, from Covington,
            Kentucky. Wood makes no mention of battles or skirmishes
            that his regiment might have been involved in, but the
            letters portray accounts of movements of the company, daily
            routine activities and items of his personal interest. He
            writes about purchasing food and other necessary items and
            mentions points of interest as they travel by railroad
            cars. Tunnels, rivers, and the prairie fascinate Private
            Wood, since these are new sights. The February 16, 1862,
            letter includes an interesting account of a slave auction
            in Platte City, Missouri, in which a woman and children
            were sold, and with the information that the latter were
            the children of the man who sold them. Wood's letters
            reveal a phonetic use of the English language and a general
            lack of knowledge of spelling or grammar. He uses clever
            combinations of vowels and consonants to acquire the words
            he wishes to express.</p>
