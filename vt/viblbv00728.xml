      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>Four works of Medieval Manuscript leaves from the 15th century, written in Latin.
                Three works on paper, one on vellum. They are most likely text from biblical works
                (Book of Hours, Bible or collection of corresponding biblical works.</p>
      <p>The three smaller leaves are written on paper, and the guides for the text are still
                seen. They each have a combination of black, red, blue and gold ink. The two works
                of approximately 3x5 inches in size, have additional calligraphic marks, of the
                illuminated letters, where the scroll work appears to have been added later with a
                finer quill. These works are also worn, as they appear to have had been put to use,
                probably as pages within a book of hours. The largest of the three is more stylized,
                with each of the illuminated letters being gold; with blue red and white decorate
                elements around. There are also some small sun- like images at the end of each line
                before the beginning letter of the next line. This page is less worn, but the text
                has some smudges and areas of wear. This leaf may be later than the 15th
                century.</p>
      <p>The largest of the four works is a work on vellum, in good condition with little to
                no discoloration. This text has reference to Mary, Martha, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
                and Judas. The text also has two illuminated letters, and I found on the front of
                the page and an L on the back of the page. There is red, blue and black ink used on
                the page, with the red and black being used mainly in the illumination. The guides
                which would have been used on the work, have been removed; this would have add to
                the prestige of the work which this page what a part of. There are some areas where
                the text is worn. The page also has more modern additions with numberings, on the
                upper center and right hand side of the first page. This text could also be earlier
                from the other three texts as it is on vellum, and not on paper (12th century to
                14th century).</p>
