      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>William Latham Candler of Brookline, Massachusetts, served in Company A of the 1st
                Massachusetts Regiment, Army of the Potomac, during the Civil War. He enlisted on
                May 25, 1861, as a 1st Lieutenant, and was promoted to Captain and Aide-de-Camp,
                U.S. Volunteers, in November 1862. He served as a captain in General Joseph Hooker's
                staff from November 10, 1862, until his resignation from service in May 1863.</p>

                    First Regiment (Massachusetts Infantry), from the 25th of May, 1861, to the 25th

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection consists of fourteen letters, dating from September 8, 1861, to
                February 15, 1863, from Candler to his uncle Charles [probably maternal uncle
                Charles Henry Wheelwright] and his brother, John W. Candler of Boston.</p>
      <p>The letters are articulate and descriptive, replete with Candler's strong opinions
                about the state of the Union, the abilities of the generals (Union and Confederate)
                who were running the war and the politicians who were running the country, and his
                own ambitions for advancing in rank and status in the army. On May 10, 1862, he
                writes from Williamsburg, Virginia, about the engagement with the Confederates and
                their sharpshooters. His June 24, 1962, letters from Fair Oaks, Virginia, and his
                July 7, 1862 letter from Harrison's Bar, Virginia, describe his units participation
                in the Battle of Mechanicsville, which was part of the Seven Days Campaign.</p>
      <p>Candler's November 6, 1862, letter, written from Washington, D.C., has much about
                General George McClellan's political troubles, written soon before McClennan was
                removed from command of the Army of the Potomac and replaced by Ambrose E. Burnside.
                His December 21, 1862, letter disparagingly comments on the Union army's performance
                at the Battle of Fredericksburg, Virginia, on December 13.</p>
      <p>Candler interspersed the letters with his concerns about the well-being of his
                fiance, and later, wife, Fannie, and his fear that his brother John will join the
                army and leave no one to care for their mother or John's children. Candler often
                asks his brother, a businessman in Boston, to send money.</p>
