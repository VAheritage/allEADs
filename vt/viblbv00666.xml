            <head>Biographical Information </head>
            <p>Olin O. Keyes is an artist native to West Virginia. After he was discharged from the
                Marine Corps in 1954, he studied engineering at Virginia Tech and graduated in 1959.
                His work is showcased in private collections and business offices across West
                Virginia coal country as well as in the Craft Memorial Library in Bluefield, WV. His
                pictures show technical insight as well as a close connection to his human subjects.
                Olin parents were Carol and Cynthia Morris Keyes and he has two sisters: Renna Carol
                Keyes, who died in 2010, and Lois Keyes Small. </p>

            <head>Scope and Content </head>
            <p>This collection consists of eight different prints depicting various common coal
                mining scenes in West Virginia as well as an "about the artist" fact sheet. The
                prints are black and white and are illustrated in a simplistic, comic book-like
                style. Some prints contain penciled-in titles. </p>
            <p>The first print depicts an above-ground wooden structure; the second shows a man
                operating a large underground machine; the third illustrates a miner's work kit; the
                fourth illustrates two men working a drilling machine; the fifth shows two men
                emerging from an underground tunnel and is entitled, "Sunlight Again"; the sixth
                shows a man steering a mule cart and is entitled, "Main Line"; the seventh depicts a
                man picking up a large piece of coal and is entitled, "Hand Loader"; and the eighth
                shows two miners working underground and is entitled, "Shot Man."</p>
