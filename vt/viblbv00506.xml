      <head>Biographical Information</head>
      <p>John Eugene Law, son of John and Katherine E. Law, was born in Forest City, Iowa, on August
        26, 1877. After graduating from high school in Perry, Iowa, Law attended the University of
        Wisconsin and Stanford University. Obtaining an A. B. in 1900, he held a series of bank
        positions in Pomona and Hollywood, California for the next several years before retiring
        from business in 1914. In 1919, he joined the California Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. Paid
        one dollar a year, Law served first as a curator in osteology and later as a curator in
        ptilology. </p>
      <p>Though he conducted considerable research (particularly in California and the Chiricahua
        Mountains of Arizona), published a number of papers and amassed a sizable collection of
        specimens, a great portion of Law's time was devoted to administrative duties for the
        Western Bird-banding Association and, to a greater extent, the Cooper Ornithological Club.
        He joined the COC in 1900 and would hold several key positions (Southern Division president,
        1905, 1913-1915; vice-president, 1916-1917; secretary, 1906-1912; business manager,
        1907-1925; president, board of governors, 1925). </p>
      <p>Law married Laura Mauldin Beatty (1886-1975) in Los Angeles on January 20, 1915. Sharing an
        interest in ornithology, the couple often performed field work together, especially in
        bird-banding. John Eugene Law died on November 14, 1931. In 1937, Laura Beatty Law married
        another ornithologist, Harold Bailey.</p>
      <p>Born in East Orange, New Jersey on October 13, 1878, Harold Harris Bailey was the son of
        Harold Balch Bailey and Lillie Adams Taylor. As a child, Bailey moved with his parents to
        Newport News, Virginia, and in 1906, he married Ida Margaret Eschenburg. Bailey worked as a
        naval architect and ship broker, perhaps while living in California, then returned to
        Newport News. He served four years as game inspector for Virginia and Maryland before
        resigning in 1918 to devote all of his time to the management of his farm on the James River
        in Virginia. Meanwhile, inheriting an interest in ornithology from his father, Bailey had
        published <title render="italic">The Birds of Virginia</title> in 1913.</p>
      <p>Bailey moved with his wife and children to Miami, Florida, where he worked with the Bureau
        of Biological Survey and published <title render="italic">The Birds of Florida</title> in
        1925. During his years in Florida, Bailey was instrumental in the establishment of
        Everglades National Park.</p>
      <p>In 1937, Bailey married Laura Beatty Law, and the couple in 1942 moved with their extensive
        collections to Goshen, Virginia, where they renovated the abandoned Rockbridge Alum Springs
        mineral spa and established the Rockbridge Alum Springs Biological Laboratory. In 1961,
        Bailey established the Bailey Research Trust (later the Bailey Wildlife Foundation).
        Following Harold Bailey's death on July 24, 1962, Laura Bailey oversaw curatorial duties for
        the collection and presented it to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in
        1969. She died in Lexington, Virginia on September 18, 1975. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head> 
      <p>The collection is organized in the following series: Series I.
      John Eugene Law Papers, 1891-1931. This series is arranged in three subseries:</p><p>
       Subseries A. Correspondence, 1902-1930. Most significant among Law's
        correspondence is a large collection of letters between Law and Joseph Grinnell, director of
        the University of California's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. Also included is correspondence
        with a handful of other naturalists. Arranged by correspondent name.
        </p><p>Subseries B. Subject files, 1912-1930. This subseries, containing
        mostly handwritten notes, consists of a collection of subject files maintained by Law
        concerning bird species, behavior and physiology. Included are large files on toxostoma
        (probably from Law's 1928 article on the curve-billed thrasher) as well as the Chiricahua
        Mountains of New Mexico, to which Law devoted a number of research trips. Arranged
        alphabetically by subject matter. </p><p>Subseries C. Research and field
        work, 1891-1931. This subseries includes materials produced by Law while performing
        ornithological research in the library and the field. Included are a series of research
        notebooks consisting largely of data gleaned from published sources. Among the field
        journals also contained in this subseries are notes on bird, nest and egg observations and
        collections made in California, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and unidentified locations.
        Arranged by document type. </p><p>Series II. Harold Harris Bailey Papers, 1910-1967.
          This series is arranged in five subseries: </p><p>Subseries A. Correspondence, 1915-1959.
        This small set of letters relates to ornithology as well as more general matters. Arranged
        chronologically. </p><p>Subseries B. Field and Research Work, 1911-1967.
        Bailey's field notes are contained in this subseries, as are a collection of bird banding
        records (which were likely commenced by John Eugene Law before being continued by Bailey),
        and various materials relating to Bailey's collections, including a case--used by both
        Bailey and his father--for collecting eggs. </p><p>Subseries C. Subject
        Files, 1910-1953. This brief subseries includes a handful of topics on which Bailey
        collected materials. Foremost among the topics is Bailey's longstanding, albeit seemingly
        one-sided, feud with the American Ornithologists' Union and the Cooper Ornithological Club,
        resulting from Bailey's stance on the 1931 A.O.U. checklist and other matters.
        </p><p>Subseries D. Publications, 1913-1947. Included within these files
        are materials arising from the publication of Bailey's <title render="italic">The Birds of
          Virginia</title> (1913) and <title render="italic">The Birds of Florida</title> (1925).
        The subseries contains production correspondence, promotional material, and sales records.
        Also included are correspondence and lists relating to the <title render="italic">Bulletin
          of the Bailey Museum and Library of Natural History</title>, together with sample issues
          of the publication. </p><p>Subseries E. Rockbridge Alum Springs,
        1945-1962. Various topics relating to the Baileys' establishment and operation of the
        Rockbridge Alum Springs Biological Laboratory are contained in this subseries. Included are
        files on Bailey's attempt to have a flyway lake constructed at the springs, an ongoing
        battle with trespassing hunters, requests for game and fish stock, the possible acquisition
        of adjoining lands, and the creation of a naturalists portrait gallery. Throughout the
        correspondence in this subseries, as elsewhere within the collection, Bailey's letters
        overflow with vitriol and belligerence, particularly against the academic naturalist
        establishment. When not criticizing fellow naturalists, he directs barbs against such
        general topics as the New Deal, the Civil Rights Movement, and communism.
          </p><p>Series III. Naturalists Biographical Files, 1825-1971. Comprising the core of the
      collection, the biographical files represent the Baileys' attempt to compile reference files
      on 19th- and 20- century naturalists. (The Baileys had titled the collection the Naturalist
      Autograph Files, but because the collection comprises more than autographs, it was given a
      broader title during processing.) The collection contains a broad scope of materials, ranging
      from correspondence to field notes, biographical sketches, printed materials, and photographs.
      Included among these are items that the Baileys "inherited" from other naturalists, as well as
      materials on a few individuals not known as naturalists, including letters signed by U. S.
      President Herbert Hoover and author James Branch Cabell, as well as a painting by artist Carl
      Moon.</p><p> Unique among the materials in this series is an autograph book maintained by Harold
      Balch Bailey, containing the autographs of notable 19th-century personages, including U. S.
      presidents and other political leaders; Union Army generals; authors; musicians; and artists.
      Also among the elder Bailey's papers are some documents regarding a 19th-century Massachusetts
      militia, including an item signed by John Quincy Adams. Other unusual items include Charles
      Townsend's file of material on Easter Island and a notebook of natural science observations
      maintained by Herman Haupt Jr. The series is arranged in two subseries:</p><p>Subseries
        A. Numerical files, 1825-1970. The files in this subseries comprise the Baileys' original
        "Naturalist Autograph Files" and remain as the couple compiled them. Each name is associated
        with a unique number, and the files are arranged numerically, with two indexes to the
        collection at the end. Many of the names represented in these files may also be found in
        Subseries II. </p><p>Subseries B. Alphabetical files, 1836-1971. The files
        in this subseries were compiled from materials found loose within the collection. The items
        seem to have been intended by the Baileys for their autograph files but had yet to be
        integrated. The collection includes the same types of materials found in the numbered
        folders but is arranged alphabetically. Many of the names represented in these files may
        also be found in Subseries I. At the end of the subseries is a bound set of various
        collectors' egg catalogs. </p><p>Series IV. Printed Material, 1882-1969. This series
      includes a small selection of printed materials deemed best left with the manuscript
      collection when other printed materials were transferred to the Rare Book Collection. Most
      significant among the holdings are materials of the Cooper Ornithological Club / Cooper
      Ornithological Society and a collection of catalogs offering bird eggs, bird skins, cabinetry,
      and supplies for ornithologists, naturalists and taxidermists. Arranged by subject matter.</p><p>
        Series V. Images, 1904-1942. This series is arranged by format in two subseries:</p><p>
        Subseries A. Color Plates and Other Illustrations, 1913-1922. This subseries
        consists largely of color plates detached from various illustrated publications, as well as
        sets of color prints. Other illustrations and paintings associated with individuals may be
        found in Series III. </p><p>Subseries B. Photographs, 1902-1937.
        Considering the breadth of Bailey and Law's research and collecting activities during a span
        of several decades, the collection contains relatively few photographs. Included is are full
        sets of original photos and half-tones used for Bailey's <title render="italic">The Birds of
          Virginia</title>. The photographs have been divided among the following categories: <title
          render="italic">The Birds of Virginia</title>, nests and eggs, birds, people, exhibits,
        specimens, and scenery. Included among the scenery are a few photos and postcards of
        Mountain Lake, the Cascades and Castle Rock in Giles County, Virginia. Photographs made by
        and of identified naturalists may be found in Series III. </p>

      <p>The extensive collection of bird skins, bird eggs, and mammal skins amassed by Law and
        Bailey were given to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University's Department of
        Biology in 1969. In 1990, the collection was transferred to the Virginia Tech branch of the
        Virginia Museum of Natural History. When the branch closed in 2003, most of the collection
        was transferred to the Virginia Museum of Natural History in Martinsville; the remainder was
        retained by Virginia Tech's Department of Biology. </p>
