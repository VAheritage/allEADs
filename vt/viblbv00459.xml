<head>Biographical Information</head>
<p>David Seth Doggett was born in December 1895 to George Brooke (b.1847) and Georgia (Georgiana?) Amanda (Anderson) Doggett (b. 1859) in Richmond, Virginia. He attended VPI from 1913-1916, graduating with a degree in Engineering. In 1918, he married Marie Jackson McLaughlin. They had three sons. Doggett died in 1972.</p><p>The &quot;Aunt Pattie&quot; mentioned in many of Doggett's letters is mostly like Martha (Pattie) Gwathmey Doggett Fitzgerald (b. abt. 1845), George's older sister. &quot;Aunt Loulie&quot; is probably one of George's younger sisters, Loulie B. Doggett (1855-1927).</p></bioghist>

<head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The collection contains Doggett's letters to his father in Richmond, Virginia, from 1912-1915, while he was a student at VPI. The letters are organized in folders by year. An additional folder contains fragments and undated correspondence.</p><p>Doggett's letters are mostly reports to his father about his activities at school. He shows constant concern for his grades and performance (possibly because his father was a teacher). The correspondence also includes news from home and requests for money.</p></scopecontent>
