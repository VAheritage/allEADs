      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Herman Haupt, civil engineer and inventor, was born in Philadelphia in 1817. Appointed to
        the United States Military Academy at age 14, Haupt graduated in 1835 and was commissioned a
        second lieutenant in the 3rd U. S. Infantry. He resigned his commission just two months
        later to become a railroad engineer. Haupt served as an assistant engineer on the survey for
        the Norristown &amp; Valley Railroad in 1835 and located the line from Gettysburg,
        Pennsylvania to the Potomac River, later incorporated as part of the Western Maryland
        Railway. </p>
      <p>In 1838, Haupt married Ann Cecelia Keller. The couple would have 11 children. </p>
      <p>Haupt served as a professor of mathematics and engineering at Pennsylvania College in
        Gettysburg from 1840 until 1847, when he accepted a position as construction engineer on the
        Pennylvania Railroad. He became the line's general superintendent in 1849. Two years later,
        Haupt was named chief engineer of the Southern Railroad of Mississippi. During this time, he
        published his most important book, <title render="italic">General Theory of Bridge
          Construction</title> (1851). Haupt returned to the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1853, serving
        as chief engineer until 1856, when he became chief engineer of the Hoosac Tunnel in western
        Massachusetts. </p>
      <p>In early 1862, Haupt was appointed chief of construction and transportation for the
        military railroad system of the Union Army and was initially given the rank of colonel. In
        September, he was promoted to brigadier general but asked to serve without pay and to be
        allowed freedom to maintain his private business affairs. When this became impossible to do,
        he resigned in September 1863.</p>
      <p>After the Civil War, Haupt worked as chief engineer or general manager for a number of
        railroads, including the Shenandoah Valley, the Richmond and Danville, and the Northern
        Pacific. He also served as president of the Dakota and Great Southern Railroad. </p>
      <p>Herman Haupt died in 1905.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains a manuscript draft written by Herman Haupt, who served as the
        chief of construction and transportation for the Union Army's military railroad system
        during the Civil War. The draft formed the basis of <title render="italic">Reminiscences of
          General Herman Haupt</title>, self-published in 1901. </p>
      <p>Haupt's reminiscences focus on his service as chief of railroad construction and
        transportation. They include Haupt's memories of personal interactions with President
        Lincoln, his cabinet, and the commanding generals of the armies of the Union. Not included
        here is the biographical sketch, written by Frank Abial Flower, that appears in Haupt's
        published reminiscences. </p>
      <p>The 349-leaf draft differs markedly from the published book, containing a number of
        passages--some short, others more significant--that do not appear in the latter. The
        original preface and introduction, for example, were omitted from the book. At the same
        time, the manuscript itself is incomplete. Most noticeably, the manuscript lacks the section
        corresponding to pages 231 to 289 in the book. Meanwhile, a set of unnumbered leaves,
        perhaps from an earlier draft, corresponds roughly to chapter 21 in the published work,
        though this set of leaves also includes the final page of what would become, in the book,
        chapter 23. </p>
      <p>Inserted within the draft are Civil War correspondence, telegraph messages, reports, and
        general orders (originals and typescript copies). Among the correspondence--and comprising
        the final leaf of the draft--is an 1889 letter from Robert Todd Lincoln.</p>
