<head>Biographical Information
</head>
<p>James P. Hawkins was born in the area of Woodstock, Shenandoah County, Virginia, ca. 1845. He was never mustered into the Confederate Army but he identified with Company L, 5th Virginia Infantry, presumably because it would have included many of his friends from home. He worked for the Southern Express Company, primarily along the Virginia Central Rail Road, throughout the Civil War, and was assigned to Danville on May 10, 1865.

<scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a">
<head>Scope and Content
</head>
<p>The principle part of the collection consists of transcripts of the 2 April 1865-11 May 1865 entries from James P. Hawkins' diaries. During this time, Hawkins was responsible for protecting the valuables of the Richmond office of the Southern Express Company. He arrived in Richmond on April 2, the day the city was evacuated, and spent the next month escorting a number of the Company's safes to Charlotte by way of Danville. On 10 May 1865 he was assigned to the Danville office. These transcripts were prepared ca. 1880-1920 by an unknown hand.
</p>
<p>The bound diary also contains notes on his expenses during his travels, a number of crossed-out memoranda, and what appears to be a draft of part of the letter held by Navarro College in the Pearce Civil War Collection.
</p>
<p>In addition there are three sheets of itemized expenses from during the time narrated by the diary, five exemptions/furloughs permitting Hawkins to continue his service to the Southern Express Company despite the Confederate draft, his autographed Oath of Allegiance to the United States following the end of the Civil War with its envelope, three envelopes addressed to Hawkins, two letters addressed to Hawkins, and an unidentified photograph taken in New Orleans ca. 1875.
</p>

<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
<head>Arrangement
</head>
<p>The transcripts of Hawkins' diaries are arranged chronologically at the beginning of the collection, followed by the related ephemera, with the unidentified photograph at the end.
