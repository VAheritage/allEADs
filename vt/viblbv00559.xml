            <p>Before the war John H. Cochran was involved in the tobacco business in Richmond,
                Virginia. When the war began he served as a private in Company A of the Wise Legion
                and later in the 46th Regiment Virginia Infantry. He was captured with most of his
                legion at Roanoke Island, North Carolina, on February 8, 1862. After parole he
                continued to serve throughout the war until he was killed in action on July 21,
                1864.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Franklin Cochran (&quot;Frank&quot;) was a private in Company E of
                the 1st Virginia Cavalry. He enlisted in Waynesboro on May 2, 1861, and was
                discharged for ill health on December 6, 1861. He died in Bosque County, Texas, in
                1893.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The Cochran family letters consist of fourteen letters written in 1860 and 1861 by
                brothers John H. and Benjamin Franklin (&quot;Frank&quot;) Cochran of Augusta County,
                Virginia.</p>
            <p>The letters from John H. Cochran, written primarily during the period between the
                election of Abraham Lincoln to the attack on Fort Sumter, show his intense interest
                in and gives a clear picture of the events that happened immediately before the
                start of the Civil War. All of his and Frank's letters were written to their mother
                in Augusta County, Virginia. The collection also includes one letter from a cousin,
                A.G. Gastins of South Carolina, to John and Benjamin Cochran's father.</p>
